Daughter of Tommy Lee Jones found dead at San Francisco hotel on New Year's Day: report
(TNND) — The daughter of actor Tommy Lee Jones, Victoria Jones, was found dead at a hotel in San Francisco early New Year's Day, according to reports. She was 34.
The San Francisco Fire Department told People that teams responded to a medical emergency at the San Francisco Fairmont at around 3 a.m. and found an unnamed person dead at the scene. TMZ was the first to report Victoria's death.
Additionally, the San Francisco Police Department confirmed officers responded to the hotel on Thursday and met with paramedics before declaring an unnamed adult female dead.
A cause of death remains unknown and officials have not released further details.
However, audio obtained by TMZ reveals the call for the incident came in as a "code 3 for the overdose, color change."
Court dockets reviewed by People also showed Victoria had been arrested at least two times in the past year. One of them was for drug possession.
In April, she was arrested in California's Napa County and charged with three misdemeanors: Obstructing a peace officer and two counts of being under the influence of a controlled substance without a valid prescription. She pleaded not guilty.
After being arrested again in May, she was detained on June 17 in Napa County and charged with misdemeanor domestic battery. She pleaded not guilty on July 1.
Victoria was the daughter of 79-year-old Tommy and his ex-wife, Kimberlea Cloughley.
She briefly followed in her father's footsteps by making appearances in 2002's "Men in Black II," 2003's "One Tree Hill" and a film directed by her father in 2005 named "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada."
