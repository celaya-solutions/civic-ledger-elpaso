Tips, Trends, and Tranquility: The nail salon that has it all
Looking for a little self-care or a little outing with friends?The Nail Clubhas quickly become an El Paso favorite for nails, relaxation, and modern style.
Founded in 2018, Jessica Sotelo, passionate about the beauty industry and especially nail art, noticed a recurring pattern in El Paso.
"Nail salons were everywhere but I saw missed opportunities in creativity, outdated techniques, and inconsistent cleanliness," Sotelo shared.
With that, The Nail Club was born - built on two promises:
- Deliver the latest in bold, stylish custom nail art.
- Maintain the highest hygiene standards so guests can feel safe and pampered.
The Nail Club offers a wide variety of services, from acrylic, hard gel, gel-x, extensions and a wide variety of pedicures.
They have natural products - such as coconut scrub.
What truly sets them apart is their exclusive pedicure system, designed to help eliminate the risk of any fungal infections - keeping feet not just beautiful, but healthy too.
For those looking for a quick, safe, and eco-friendly options, they carry organic products like dazzle dry, a polish that sets in under 15 minutes, lasts up to two weeks and be removed easily at home.
The Nail Club offers private event hosting for bridal showers, birthdays, and special occasions. It's the perfect way to celebrate while being pampered.
