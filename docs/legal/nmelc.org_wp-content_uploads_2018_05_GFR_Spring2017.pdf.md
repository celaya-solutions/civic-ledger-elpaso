Environm ental Defense in the Trum p Er a:
and w hat w e ’re up against 
N ew  M exico Environm ental Law  Cente r | SPR IN G 2017 YEARS
It will take some time to realize the full impact of the 
Trump administration’s anti-environmental policies on 
New Mexico’s communities and natural resources. But 
we believe that there will be widespread fallout that 
will touch everything from the air we breathe and the 
water we drink to civil rights. The one thing we know 
is that it’s going to be a tough fight for the next couple 
of years under two administrations (state and federal) 
that put little value on environmental protection. 
While we work to defend our state, we know that Trump 
has installed leadership antithetical to agency missions, 
will defund agencies, slash staffing and muzzle those 
who remain. These are the folks who protect New Mexico’s 
surface water; who are tasked with enforcing environ -
mental justice; and who have been working to address 
climate change at the national and international levels. 
In addition, federal agencies, especially the Department 
of Energy and Department of Defense, have created 
significant environmental liabilities in our state. While 
Trump has announced his intent to boost nuclear and 
Green FireReportCom ing soon to a “city” near you… 
C om e tell us how  w e’re doing, how  YO U ’RE  doing, and celebrate w ith us 30 years of fighting to protect N ew  M exico’ s 
air, land, w ater and com m unities. W e’ ll be hosting gatherings in Taos, Silver C ity, Las C ruces, A lbuquerque and

military spending, it’s uncertain at this point what he will 
do to fix the massive contamination at federal energy and 
defense sites. And that’s before Congress gets around to 
gutting federal laws. 
The federal government doesn’t regulate everything, 
however. New Mexico employees handle many 
environmental matters: groundwater quality, air quality 
and hazardous waste are just some of the issues under 
their jurisdiction. For the past six years, the Martinez 
administration has worked hard to weaken 
environmental protections and erode the public’s ability 
to participate in decision-making. And it’s about to get 
worse, currently the New Mexico Environment 
Department receives 27% of its $79 million annual budget 
from the federal government. Amidst the uncertainty, 
what we do know is that public interest lawyers play an 
important role in times like these. As we’ve seen with 
Governor Martinez, politicians have a habit of adopting 
unconstitutional policies and regulations. The Law Center 
gives New Mexicans the ability to challenge them when 
they do.

N M ELC specializes in local and state casew ork, but w e still have plenty 
on our docket that could be im pacted by the Trum p adm inistration .
LO S ALAM O S N ATIO N AL LABO RATO RY: Trump is promising to grow the 
nuclear weapons program, but it’s unlikely he’ll kick in the nearly $3 billion 
needed to clean up existing waste at the Lab that already threatens regional 
drinking water and air quality. 
U RA N IU M  M IN IN G : While we remain doubtful that Trump can provide the 
nuclear renaissance that mining companies are looking for, he can pressure the 
Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to ram through mining permits 
that could prove troublesome for communities in the future. 
KIRTLAN D  JET FU EL SPILL: 24 million gallons of highly carcinogenic jet fuel is 
migrating through Albuquerque's aquifer toward drinking water wells. Will Trump's 
Air Force better address this massive threat? We (and more than a half-million 
Burquenos who want healthy drinking water) hope so – but we'll fight if it's not. 
BETTER AIR Q U ALITY FO R ALBU Q U ERQ U E: Regulators from Albuquerque 
and Bernalillo County continue to unapologetically approve air polluting facilities 
in low-income neighborhoods of color. In the summer of 2016, the EPA agreed to 
investigate a 2014 civil rights complaint filed by the Law Center and its client, the 
SouthWest Organizing Project, but it may have been too little, too late. We will 
continue to fight for better air quality at the local level. 
SAN  AU G U STIN  W ATER G RAB: Is Trump planning to meddle in an Italian 
billionaire’s speculative scheme to suck up 17 billion gallons of water each year 
from Catron County? Perhaps. A water pipeline proposed by Augustin Plains 
Ranch, LLC appeared in a hastily retracted list of infrastructure projects attributed 
to the White House in January. 
H ARD RO CK M IN IN G : We hope that federal land managers will stand up for our 
public lands in coming years, but our challenges will be even greater for sites like 
the ill-advised Copper Flat mine near Truth or Consequences , despite its likely 
impacts on the Rio Grande. Oil & gas drilling and pipelines also are likely to 
crop up on public lands near you under the Trump administration .
Thank you for m aking our w ork possible,

For years, the Law  C enter, our clients, and others have 
fought a prevalent practice by the A lbuquerque- 
Bernalillo C ounty A ir Q uality Board (Board) and the 
E nvironm ental H ealth D epartm ent (E H D ) to perm it air 
polluting facilities in low -incom e neighborhoods of color. 
(C lients, Esther and Steven live in the San Jose 
neighborhood, w hich is hom e to 1% of the C ounty’s 
population but 28%  of the C ounty’s air pollution perm its. 
O ther neighborhoods affected by this practice include 
M ountainview  in the South Valley of A lbuquerque and 
the G reater G ardner neighborhood of the N orth Valley.) 
I started the New Mexico Environmental Law Center in response 
to the election of a State Attorney General who had no interest in 
protecting our environment; 30 years later – long after his term 
ended – the Law Center is going strong. In fact, because of your 
support, we have challenged scores of officials (and companies and 
schemes) who would endanger our most vulnerable communities 
and vital resources. Together, we have made a real difference for our 
state’s people and places. 
I thought that when Governor Martinez was elected, the Law 
Center was facing its greatest executive challenge. Her very first 
executive order tried to prevent the printing of regulations limiting 
greenhouse gas emissions – and since then her administration has 
not let up on its anti-environment, anti-science, anti-public agenda. 
Given our new president’s actions and appointments to date, 
however, I think I was wrong about the governor. 
But there is something that we can do, right now, to prepare for the 
future. In the face of adversity, the Law Center seeks to become an 
even stronger force for the public interest in our state. That is why 
we are undertaking the NMH2O Campaign during our 30th year. 
This year, we are raising funds to hire an experienced water attorney, 
a recently graduated water fellow to mentor in public-interest water 
law, and a paralegal to help all of our attorneys accomplish more. 
With threats from climate change, privatization, and legalized 
pollution, water is threatened today in our state like never before. 
We need great lawyers who will focus on its protection, and who 
will develop solutions to protect our rural communities and our 
urban communities and their drinking water supplies. 
The price tag? Roughly $150,000 for year 1 (starting in 2018). I’m 
pleased to say that we’ve already been given the opportunity to 
obtain a $50,000 challenge grant, and now I need to ask for your 
help to get the rest of the way. 
I am humbled by the trust you have placed in the Law Center and 
me. Together, I am optimistic about what we can do in a time that 
will threaten our people and our resources. If you would like to 
contribute to this campaign, or can 
help, please contact Elizabeth Lee, 
Director of Philanthropy, at 
(505) 989-9022. 
Thank you.

Eight years after it began, the Law Center and our client, the Rio Bonito Preserve, closed a case that will help keep 
water in Lincoln County’s beautiful Rio Bonito. The Law Center took over the case from private attorney Ed Newville, 
and assisted our clients in negotiating a settlement that will lead to a regional water solution. 
Rio Bonito Preserve’s President Reginald Richey said at the end of this lengthy process, “Our small group is forever 
grateful to the Law Center for representing us in these important issues and know that without the legal guidance provided by 
Ed and Law Center Attorneys Bruce Frederick and Jon Block, our advocacy on behalf of the Rio Bonito would likely have gone 
unheard.” For m ore inform ation about the nuts and bolts of this case, see nm elc.org.

poor air quality in these neighborhoods, despite significant anecdotal evidence and data from  citizen air sam pling.

Environm ental Defense in the Trum p Er a:
and w hat w e ’re up against 
N ew  M exico Environm ental Law  Cente r | SPR IN G 2017 YEARS
It will take some time to realize the full impact of the 
Trump administration’s anti-environmental policies on 
New Mexico’s communities and natural resources. But 
we believe that there will be widespread fallout that 
will touch everything from the air we breathe and the 
water we drink to civil rights. The one thing we know 
is that it’s going to be a tough fight for the next couple 
of years under two administrations (state and federal) 
that put little value on environmental protection. 
While we work to defend our state, we know that Trump 
has installed leadership antithetical to agency missions, 
will defund agencies, slash staffing and muzzle those 
who remain. These are the folks who protect New Mexico’s 
surface water; who are tasked with enforcing environ -
mental justice; and who have been working to address 
climate change at the national and international levels. 
In addition, federal agencies, especially the Department 
of Energy and Department of Defense, have created 
significant environmental liabilities in our state. While 
Trump has announced his intent to boost nuclear and 
Green FireReportCom ing soon to a “city” near you… 
C om e tell us how  w e’re doing, how  YO U ’RE  doing, and celebrate w ith us 30 years of fighting to protect N ew  M exico’ s 
air, land, w ater and com m unities. W e’ ll be hosting gatherings in Taos, Silver C ity, Las C ruces, A lbuquerque and

military spending, it’s uncertain at this point what he will 
do to fix the massive contamination at federal energy and 
defense sites. And that’s before Congress gets around to 
gutting federal laws. 
The federal government doesn’t regulate everything, 
however. New Mexico employees handle many 
environmental matters: groundwater quality, air quality 
and hazardous waste are just some of the issues under 
their jurisdiction. For the past six years, the Martinez 
administration has worked hard to weaken 
environmental protections and erode the public’s ability 
to participate in decision-making. And it’s about to get 
worse, currently the New Mexico Environment 
Department receives 27% of its $79 million annual budget 
from the federal government. Amidst the uncertainty, 
what we do know is that public interest lawyers play an 
important role in times like these. As we’ve seen with 
Governor Martinez, politicians have a habit of adopting 
unconstitutional policies and regulations. The Law Center 
gives New Mexicans the ability to challenge them when 
they do.
