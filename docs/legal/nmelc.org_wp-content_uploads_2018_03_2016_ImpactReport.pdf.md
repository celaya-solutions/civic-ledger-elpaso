By the end of 2016 we knew the road ahead was going to be a 
rocky one. We didn’t know then just how difficult it would be. 
But as I write this letter in spring 2017, it’s clear that our 
environment – and low-income communities and communities of 
color that often bear the brunt of environmental degradation – 
are going to be even more vulnerable over the next four years. 
In New Mexico, we have been dealing since 2011 with an 
administration that favors the financial interests of industry 
and development over the basic protections of individual 
residents’ health and wellbeing. We fought hard every day 
of 2016 to preserve protective regulations, promote safe and 
sustainable industry practices, and to defend the right of the 
public to participate in rulemaking processes. 
As you’ll see in our Top 10 list of case highlights through the year, 
we achieved a number of important successes. Environmental law 
is a long game. Some victories, such as the hard-won termination 
of the Churchrock uranium permit, are meaningful outcomes for 
our clients. Other successes came in the form of simply preserving 
the right to keep fighting. This is important, as while we are fighting ,
often the destructive activity we are fighting against cannot move 
forward. 
We vow to fight just as hard when rollbacks of federal regulations 
and decimation of protective agencies such as the Environmental 
Protection Agency itself threaten harm to the air we breathe, the 
water we drink, and the land we inhabit here in New Mexico. 
And we promise to keep fighting our own state administration 
when necessary to protect our resources and our communities 
as well. The fight can only happen with your support.

O nce again, the Law  C enter held the line at the State Legislature! Thanks to persistent efforts by executive 
director Doug Meiklejohn and our many allies at the Roundhouse, not a single bad environmental bill got 
through in the 2016 session. 
In a case that threatens drinking w ater for half a m illion residents of A lbuquerque, the Law  C enter 
entered into negotiations w ith the U S A ir Force to push for expedited cleanup of more than 24 million 
gallons of highly carcinogenic jet fuel that was discovered in 1999 to be leaking from a facility on the 
Kirtland Air Force Base. The toxic underground plume is moving toward several drinking water wells. 
The Air Force requested the confidential negotiations after the Law Center filed intent of notice to sue on 
behalf of SWOP , two state senators and several Albuquerque residents. 
In a hard-fought and welcome victory, w e w on our case to force the State to term inate a groundw ater 
discharge perm it for a new, controversial uranium mine proposed near Church Rock, NM. 
Without a valid permit, mining cannot begin at the site. 
In a very disappointing decision, the N ew  M exico Suprem e C ourt declined to hear our 
appeal of the Pit Rule , which governs the storage and disposal of wastes at oil and gas 
drilling pits in the state. Serving as co-counsel with the New Mexico Wilderness 
Alliance, representing Earthworks’ Oil and Gas Accountability Project, the Law Center 
had been fighting to overturn the Rule since it was gutted in 2013. 
In a m ajor victory for our clients fighting the proposed Santolina m ega-developm ent on 
the western edge of Albuquerque, the 2nd Judicial District Court denied three attempts by our 
opponent to get our appeals of the Level A Master Plan dismissed. As of press time, we are waiting for 
a ruling on our arguments against the scheme, including that the developers have not proven the project 
has water. Executive director Doug Meiklejohn and staff attorney Jaimie Park continue to fight approval 
of the next step in the developer’s path, the Level B Master Plan. 
Law Center staff attorney Jon Block and our client, Nuclear Watch New Mexico, filed a lawsuit in federal 
court against the Department of Energy and Los Alamos National Security, the for-profit operator of Los 
Alamos National Laboratory, over failure to m eet critical cleanup 
m ilestones under a 2005 “C onsent O rder”  they agreed to w ith the 
N ew  M exico Environm ent D epartm ent . Our suit claims 
12 violations of missed deadlines, of up to 675 days each . 
Our initial cost estimate of the alleged violations? $300 million 
and counting! 
Bringing the (former) might of the EPA down on local polluters, the agency decided to 
investigate the Albuquerque Air Board for civil rights violations after Law Center staff 
attorney Eric Jantz and our client SouthWest Organizing Project (SWOP) filed a complaint 
against it for ignoring poor air quality in environmental justice neighborhoods. Follow ing the 
EPA  notice, the Board agreed to respond to com plaints in w riting and to engage in inform al 
dispute resolution w ith SW O P . Since Trump took office, however, the Board has taken no substantive 
or meaningful steps toward addressing the problems. 
In an Inspection of Public Records Act request related to 
proposed ground water regulation amendments, s taff 
attorney Jaim ie Park discovered a literal "H it List" of 
protective environm ental regulations that the state 
Environm ent D epartm ent had targeted for attack. 
Jaimie filed comprehensive comments on the proposed 
amendments to surface and groundwater regulations, 
which constitute an attempt to limit public participation in 
the permitting process and roll back standards for certain 
contaminants. A hearing will be held in the future. 
Eight years after it began, the Law  C enter and our client, 
the Rio Bonito Preserve, closed a successful case that will 
help keep water running in the beautiful Rio Bonito, 
which flows through Lincoln County. 
C ulm inating m ore than four years of fighting the statew ide 
C opper Rule, the Law  C enter presented oral argum ent 
before the state Suprem e C ourt. 
The rule, adopted in 2013, is 
the first regulation since the state’s 
adoption of its Water Quality Act in 1967 that allows an entire industry to 
intentionally pollute groundwater. The court’s ruling will set 
precedent for how New Mexico protects water at industrial 
sites throughout the state. As of publication , the court has 
not yet issued its decision. This was our last line of 
defense – until the next governor takes office…

In 2016, the New Mexico State Engineer gave Augustin Plains Ranch, LLC 
a chance to resubmit its failed application for more than 17 billion gallons 
of water annually. NMELC represents nearly 100 residents of west-central 
New Mexico in their effort to defeat the Ranch's speculative scheme.
