Environmental Justice
“Racial discrimination in environmental policy making
and the enforcement of regulations and laws, the
deliberate targeting of people of color communities
for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the
life threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in
our communities, and the history of excluding people
of color from the leadership of the environmental
movement.”
Dr. Reverend Benjamin Chavis

Cumulative Impacts
refers to the total burden – positive, neutral, or negative – from chemical 
and non-chemical stressors and their interactions that affect the health, 
well-being, and quality of life of an individual, community, or population at a 
given point in time or over a period of time. Cumulative impacts include 
contemporary exposures in various environments where individuals spend 
time and past exposures that have lingering effects. Total burden 
encompasses direct health effects and indirect effects to people through 
impacts on resources and the environment that affect human health and 
well-being. Cumulative impacts provide context for characterizing the 
potential state of vulnerability or resilience of the community, i.e., their 
ability to withstand or recover from additional
exposures under consideration.
