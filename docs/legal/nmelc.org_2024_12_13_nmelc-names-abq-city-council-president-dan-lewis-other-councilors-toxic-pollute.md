Albuquerque, NM—The New Mexico Environmental Law Center (NMELC) announced the winners of its Annual Environmental Justice Awards for 2024. The winners were celebrated during NMELC’s Annual EJ Awards event held on Thursday, December 12th at the Harwood Art Center in downtown Albuquerque. The five awards given out include the tongue-in-cheek “award” for Toxic Polluter, which was “awarded” to Dan Lewis, Klarissa Peña, Louie Sanchez and Brook Bassan.

Other awards included the Karl Souder Award for Water Protection, the Jeanne Gauna Community Environmental Advocacy Award, the Youth Earth Protector Award, and an award for Special Recognition of Extraordinary Commitment given to an organization.
