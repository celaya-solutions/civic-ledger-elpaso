Economic Development Projects
Project Jupiter is a large-scale data center campus proposed for development in Doña Ana County, in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. The project is being led by STACK Infrastructure in partnership with BorderPlex Digital Assets. With an estimated total investment of up to $165,000,000,000 it represents one of the most significant private-sector infrastructure initiatives in the region’s history.
Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB)
In the State of New Mexico, an IRB helps attract jobs and investment by offering a tax abatement, and it doesn’t place a financial risk on the Government entity authorizing it. It’s a common tool used by other communities to stay competitive in attracting major projects.
What is an Industrial Revenue Bond, IRB?
It is a common economic development tool used by states and local governments to attract businesses that will bring jobs to an area. The participating companies fund the project. When a company gets an IRB approved, they won’t pay property taxes during the time the IRB is in place but will almost always have to make “payment in lieu of taxes” (PILOT).
Why Would a Government Entity Issue an IRB for a project?
A Government entity uses IRBs as a tool to attract projects; Doña Ana County has issued many IRBs in the past to support companies, either for expansion of their operations or to attract new businesses.

Safeguards
- Facilities Closure Claw Backs: If company closes early, it must repay all or a portion of tax breaks.
- Job Targets: Company must meet promised employment goals and failure to meet them results in repayment of tax breaks or increased PILOT payments, based upon agreement structure.
- Certain Defaults by Company: The County can terminate the IRB Lease and transfer the property back to the Company, putting the property back on the tax rolls.
