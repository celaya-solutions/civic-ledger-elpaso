Can you sue for holiday food poisoning? Legal expert weighs in
El Paso, TX (KFOX14/CBS4) — In this week's "Legal Jargon" segment, attorney Daniela Labinoti addressed a common holiday concern: food poisoning from holiday meals.
Labinoti confirmed that individuals can file a negligence or product liability claim against the company, restaurant, distributor, or manufacturer responsible for the contaminated food.
"Absolutely, you can file a lawsuit," she said, emphasizing the need for medical documentation linking the illness to the food consumed.
Labinoti explained that proof of purchase and medical evidence are crucial for a successful claim.
She noted, "You have to show causation, meaning that you prove that it was as a result of what you ate." Compensation can cover hospital bills, lost wages, and other damages. Nadia clarified, "It's about compensation for harm. It's not about being paid."
