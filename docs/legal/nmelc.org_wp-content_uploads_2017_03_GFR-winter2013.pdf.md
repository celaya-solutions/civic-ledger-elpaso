Law Center leads way to court victory: Judge affirms no permit
for San Augustin Ranch, LLC
With the help of our members and donors, we’ve been winning the fight against 
a massive water grab in beautiful west-central New Mexico!
Our second major victory came on November 15, 2012, when a state district court judge
upheld a decision to deny a 54,000 acre-feet appropriation by the Augustin Plains Ranch.
The ruling affirms the State Engineer’s decision in April 2012 to deny the Ranch’s application.
Under the W estern water system, big appropriations are legal – but the applicant must
show , among other things, that it has an actual use for all of the water it seeks and that
the water will be used in a timely manner.  In spite of these requirements, the Ranch
offered no specific plans in its application for what it would do with 17.5 billion gallons
per year. 
Since 2008, the Law Center has provided free representation to more than 80 families in
Catron and Socorro Counties in this case. But the outcome of this case would be felt far
beyond Catron County: approval of the Ranch’s proposal would open the door to 
wide-scale water speculation throughout New Mexico.
In January , the Ranch appealed the decision. Y et in our arid state, the story is far from
over even if the Ranch's appeal is unsuccessful. The Albuquerque Journalreports that
D.L. Sanders, lead attorney for the State Engineer, has urged the Ranch to submit a
new application, stating, “W e’re in favor of promoting innovative ideas like this.”
As a supporter of the Law Center, you ensure that we can continue to fight speculation
in water and promote equitable access and use of water for all of us who depend upon
New Mexico’s water.

Copper Rule Latest T arget
If you live near a dairy , a dry cleaner , or a gas
station (to name a few types of facilities that
pollute groundwater), what is happening
today in the Copper Rule case may impact
your community tomorrow .
The Copper Rule was intended to help
protectwater beneath open-pit copper
mines. Over eight months in 2012, draft 
language was hammered out by a working
group comprised of regulators, representa-
tives from the state’s copper companies 
(primarily Freeport McMoRan, the largest
publicly-traded copper company in the
world) and advocates for the public
interest, including our own Staff Attorney
Bruce Frederick. The draft included 
concessions to the
mining industry
but also preserved
critical, hard-won 
protections for
groundwater .
Then the political
appointees got
their hands on it.
Ignoring the recommendations of their
own technical staff, upper-level managers
at the New Mexico Environment
Department (NMED) revamped the draft
Copper Rule to reflect comments made by
GreenFireReport winter 2013 issue Sponsor
“

Oil & Gas Pit Rule:    
Since 2008, the Law Center has defended the Pit Rule – 
regulations that protect water from toxic oil and gas 
drilling wastes. For the past year, we have represented 
the Oil and Gas Accountability Project in a public 
hearing process before the Oil Conservation 
Commission, whose Martinez appointees were 
sympathetic to industry . In February , the Commission 
adopted four key industry amendments with some 
modifications. We anticipate that we will appeal its decision.
2013 Legislative Session:     
For its 25th time, the Law Center is defending New Mexico's 
environment and communities during the state 
legislative session. With a 60-day session in progress, 
we’re up to our necks in late nights and long 
hearings as we work to convince legislators that
water quality, public health, and civic participation 
are issues they should support.
Who is Making
Decisions for 
Our Environment?
With your support, the Law Center is
opposing many of the decisions made
by Governor Martinez’s appointees –
especially those who have potential
biases in favor of policies that would
benefit clients of their current or former
employers.  Some of the conflicts we are
challenging:
RYAN FL YNN, ESQ. Prior to heading
the legal department at the New Mexico
Environment Department, Mr. Flynn
worked as an Associate Attorney for the
Modrall Sperling law firm.  The Modrall
firm represents Freeport McMoRan (and
its predecessor Phelps Dodge). For years,
its attorneys have argued strenuously ,
albeit unsuccessfully , to undermine the
W ater Quality Act at the T yrone, Chino
and Cobre copper mines.  
ELIZABETH RYAN , ESQ. Ms. Ryan is a
Martinez appointee to the Environmental
Improvement Board.  In 2011, she was
hired by Beatty & W ozniak, a law firm
that represents major oil and gas 
companies.  Shortly thereafter, Ms. Ryan
voted to kill the State’s new greenhouse
gas limits, which were opposed by the
oil & gas industry .
ROBERT BALCH , PH.D. Before joining
the Oil Conservation Commission, Dr.
Balch told members of the oil and gas
industry , “The new [Pit Rule] makes it
harder for you to operate, makes wells
more costly…I hope we can form a
dialogue that will genuinely improve
the situation.” Commissioner Balch
voted to adopt amendments that
would gut the Pit Rule.

< The Chino copper mine near Silver City is the nation’s 4th largest open-pit mine. A weak Copper Rule
is being advocated by its owner, Freeport McMoRan.
Big Copper . “This draft, which purports
to be a statewide regulation to prevent
water 
pollution,” wrote Frederick in a
scathing letter to agency Secretary David
Martin, “is now specifically designed to
accommodate Freeport McMoRan’s desire
to pollute groundwater ...”
Should the copper industry receive such 
a regulatory gift from the Martinez
Administration, we anticipate that other
industries will line up for similar treatment. 
The pro-pollution Copper Rule language
went to the Water Quality Control
Commission in November 2012 for 
consideration. In December , the Law Center
and its co-counsel, T racy Hughes, of High
Desert Energy+Environment Law Partners
asked the Commission to dismiss the peti-
tion on the grounds that the Rule would
violate the state’s Water Quality Act.
Y ou can see Bruce Frederick’s letter , along
with our case documentsat nmelc.org.
W e represent the Gila Resources
Information Project, Amigos Bravos, 
and T urner Enterprises in this case.
Historic Settlement:     
The Navajo Nation and mining company Uranium 
Resources inked a historic deal in 2012, settling a case in 
which tribal police cited the company for trespass (the 
company must cross a strip of tribal land in order to access its 
private property.)  The deal calls for the company to remediate Cold War-era
waste at its first proposed minesite before it can begin mining. With the Law
Center at its side, the Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining
(ENDAUM) will be an ardent advocate for effective reclamation in 
those efforts.
[ Martinez Administration, continued from page 1]
“The interests of protecting public
health and safety and our state’s
natural resources appear to have been
overridden by the one company
with the most to gain
from revising these regulations.”  
–Letter to Secretary Martin
Dairy Update:
For the third time in three years, we are at work to protect 
groundwater from factory farm waste. The dairy industry
has petitioned the W ater Quality Control Commission 
to weaken several provisions in New Mexico’s new 
dairy groundwater regulations. Unfortunately for our 
water supplies, the Commission is circumventing several 
laws by considering the petition.  The hearing begins in July . 
Navajo Mining Ban Under Threat: 
Uranium Resources (formerly Hydro Resources) has hired former Navajo Nation
President Albert Hale to lobby for the repeal of the Navajo Nation’s ban on 
uranium mining and milling.  Hale served as President of the Navajo Nation 
from 1994-1998, when he was forced to step down after his indictment 
on dozens of federal charges. The Law Center is working 
with ENDAUM to defend this landmark law. 
Mount Taylor Mine Goes to Court:   
The Cold W ar-era Mount T aylor Mine won its fourth mining 
permit renewal in 2012.  The Law Center and its clients, 
the Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment and 
Amigos Bravos, argued that the State should require 
the uranium mine, shuttered since 1990, to begin 
reclamation in order to mitigate ongoing contamination.  
Now we are in district court, arguing that the state Mining
and Minerals Division shut the public out of the permit 
hearing process. We’ve already won one victory to date: our efforts
pressured the agency to require the mining company to update its 
financial assurance and closeout plan for the first time in nearly 15 years.

We were thrilled to present Marcy Leavitt with the Karl Souder Water Protection
Award in December. It was a bittersweet moment in which we also noted the loss of
Karl’s father, Arnold Souder, who passed away earlier in the week.

Law Center leads way to court victory: Judge affirms no permit
for San Augustin Ranch, LLC
With the help of our members and donors, we’ve been winning the fight against 
a massive water grab in beautiful west-central New Mexico!
Our second major victory came on November 15, 2012, when a state district court judge
upheld a decision to deny a 54,000 acre-feet appropriation by the Augustin Plains Ranch.
The ruling affirms the State Engineer’s decision in April 2012 to deny the Ranch’s application.
Under the W estern water system, big appropriations are legal – but the applicant must
show , among other things, that it has an actual use for all of the water it seeks and that
the water will be used in a timely manner.  In spite of these requirements, the Ranch
offered no specific plans in its application for what it would do with 17.5 billion gallons
per year. 
Since 2008, the Law Center has provided free representation to more than 80 families in
Catron and Socorro Counties in this case. But the outcome of this case would be felt far
beyond Catron County: approval of the Ranch’s proposal would open the door to 
wide-scale water speculation throughout New Mexico.
In January , the Ranch appealed the decision. Y et in our arid state, the story is far from
over even if the Ranch's appeal is unsuccessful. The Albuquerque Journalreports that
D.L. Sanders, lead attorney for the State Engineer, has urged the Ranch to submit a

Copper Rule Latest T arget
If you live near a dairy , a dry cleaner , or a gas
station (to name a few types of facilities that
pollute groundwater), what is happening
today in the Copper Rule case may impact
your community tomorrow .
The Copper Rule was intended to help
protectwater beneath open-pit copper
mines. Over eight months in 2012, draft 
language was hammered out by a working
group comprised of regulators, representa-
tives from the state’s copper companies 
(primarily Freeport McMoRan, the largest
publicly-traded copper company in the
world) and advocates for the public
interest, including our own Staff Attorney
Bruce Frederick. The draft included 
concessions to the
mining industry
but also preserved
critical, hard-won 
protections for
groundwater .
Then the political
appointees got
their hands on it.
Ignoring the recommendations of their
own technical staff, upper-level managers
at the New Mexico Environment
Department (NMED) revamped the draft
Copper Rule to reflect comments made by
