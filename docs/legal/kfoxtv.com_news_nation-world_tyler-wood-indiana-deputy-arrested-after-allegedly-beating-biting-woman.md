Indiana deputy arrested after allegedly beating, biting woman in domestic incident
MUNCIE, Ind. (WKRC) — An Indiana deputy was arrested after he allegedly attacked and bit a woman in a domestic incident on Tuesday, according to a report.
WXIN noted that Tyler Wood, a Blackford County Sheriff's deputy, was placed on unpaid administrative leave after he was arrested on several domestic violence charges.
The report states that authorities responded to a residence in Muncie, Indiana after receiving a call regarding domestic violence on Wednesday. During the call, authorities said they could hear a male saying, "You're bleeding all over the apartment," per the outlet.
Upon arriving at the scene, officers met with a woman who was bleeding from the forehead. Wood was found inside, and he was detained, while the woman was taken the hospital for treatment of multiple injuries, per WXIN's report.
According to the outlet, the woman was suffering the following injuries:
- Head injuries
- Injuries to her arms and legs
- Injuries from alleged punches and kicks
- Injuries from alleged bites
When speaking with police, the woman said Wood went upstairs after the alleged assault and heard him yell that he was going to "kill her," then used the opportunity to call 911, per the outlet.
Wood, a deputy since 2022, was taken to the Delaware County Jail, where he is being held.
The Blackford County Sheriff's Office issued the following statement on the matter to WXIN:
"On 12-30-2025 the Blackford County Sheriff’s Office was made aware of a serious off-duty incident involving Tyler Wood, a deputy who has been employed with this office for more than three years, which resulted in criminal charges being filed by an outside law enforcement agency."
"That same night, the Chief Deputy and I responded and initiated a formal internal administrative investigation. As of today, he has been placed on unpaid administrative leave pending the outcome of the internal administrative proceedings. Allegations involving violence are treated with the utmost seriousness and are thoroughly investigated. Any conduct that violates the law or the standards of this office will be addressed through the appropriate legal and administrative processes."
"Because this matter involves an active criminal case and pending merit proceedings, the Sheriff’s Office is limited in what can be publicly disclosed at this time. The deputy is entitled to due process, and the case will proceed through the established legal and merit-based channels. Our responsibility is to ensure accountability, protect the integrity of this office, and maintain the trust and safety of the community we serve."
The statement was signed by Blackford Co Sheriff James Heflin.
