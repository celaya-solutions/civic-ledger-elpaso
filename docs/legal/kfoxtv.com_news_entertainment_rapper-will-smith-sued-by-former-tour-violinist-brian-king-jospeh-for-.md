Will Smith sued by former tour violinist for sexual harassment and wrongful termination
(TNND) — A violinist who performed with Will Smith during his concert tour last year is suing the rapper and his production company just before the New Year, claiming wrongful termination and sexual harassment.
Brian King Joseph alleges in the complaint that he was retaliated against for reporting workplace safety hazards, according to documents obtained by People.
According to the complaint, Joseph accuses Smith of "deliberately grooming and priming Mr. Joseph for further sexual exploitation" after asking him to join his global tour, "Based on a True Story: 2025."
Joseph alleges that when he entered his Las Vegas hotel room while on tour, he found a handwritten note to "Brian," and a backpack with a beer bottle, wipes and a bottle of HIV medication.
The lawsuit states Joseph "feared that an unknown individual would soon return to his room to engage in sexual acts" with him and accuses Smith of "grooming" him.
Smith's lawyer, Allen B. Grodsky, vehemently denied the claims, stating, "Mr. Joseph’s allegations concerning my client are false, baseless, and reckless."
"They are categorically denied, and we will use all legal means available to address these claims and to ensure that the truth is brought to light," Grodsky said in a statement.
After Joseph reported the incident to hotel staff, the complaint alleges someone from the tour management team "shamed" him and told him he was being fired.
The lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County says the termination caused "severe emotional distress, economic loss, reputational harm, and other damages,” including “PTSD and other mental illness as a result of the termination."
Days before the lawsuit was filed, Joseph took to Instagram to share a video of him hinting at a legal matter.
"Earlier this year I was hired to be a performer on a major major tour with somebody who was huge in the industry. So I was excited, you know, proud of myself for getting the opportunity. Unfortunately some things happened," Joseph said.
"I can't get too into the details of exactly what that was because it's already a legal issue right now, but the reason why I'm speaking out about this is because getting fired or getting blamed or shamed or threatened or anything like that simply for reporting sexual misconduct or safety threats at work is not okay," he continued. "I know that there's a lot of other people out there who have been afraid to speak out, and I understand, and if that's you, I see you."
