New Mexico Environmental Law Center cases in litigation  
during 2015 fiscal year (January 1, 2015 – December 31, 2015) 
 
Case #1 
Aquifer Science, LLC., v. Scott Verhines, New Mexico State Engineer. 
This is a case in the New Mexico District Court for the Second Judicial District.  It is case 
number  CV-2014-07209.  It is an appeal from an a decision of the New Mexico State Engineer 
denying an application for water use from the Aquifer Science company to supply water to a 
proposed development on its Campbell Ranch property.  By statute, this is a trial de novo 
(essentially, a "do over") on the underlying issues upon which the State Engineer determined to 
deny the water use application. 
 The public interest here is in protecting the water supplies of persons who obtain water 
from the Sandia Basin--which the State Engineer declared to be closed to further development, as 
all water rights within it have been previously allocated and are used. The New Mexico 
Environmental Law Center represents two groups of citizens from areas adjacent to the proposed 
development whose usable water would be threatened by Aquifer Science, LLC being allowed to 
pump water for its development.   It is also the case that this appears to be a speculative venture for 
the proponents of the development rather than an attempt to obtain a water right that would be put 
to beneficial use.  Here, the purpose appears to be to upgrade the value of the property with water 
right in order to make it marketable.  
 The New Mexico Environmental Law Center has neither sought nor recovered attorneys’  
fees from an opposing party in this case. 
 
Case #2 
Augustin Plains Ranch, LLC  v. New Mexico State Engineer 
This is case number 32,705 in the New Mexico Court of Appeals.  During 2015, this case 
also was litigated in the Seventh Judicial District Court of New Mexico, where the case number 
was D-728-CV-2012-0008.   
In 2007, Augustin Plains Ranch (“the Ranch”) applied to the New Mexico State Engineer 
for a permit to appropriate 54,000 acre-feet of groundwater from the middle Rio Grande 
Underground Water Basin. The Ranch proposed to take the water from Catron County in 
Southern New Mexico and export it South to Texas or North to Santa Fe. The New Mexico 
Environmental Law Center represents approximately 80 local community members who opposed 
the Ranch’s application. 
When this matter was considered by the New Mexico State Engineer, the State Engineer 
denied the Ranch’s application.  That denial was upheld by the New Mexico District Court for 
the Seventh Judicial District, and the Ranch appealed to the New Mexico Court of Appeals.  In 
August, 2014, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on the basis of a motion filed by the 
Ranch asserting that the appeal was moot.  During 2015, there was further litigation in the 
Seventh Judicial District Court about whether the District Court case should be dismissed and 
whether the matter should be remanded to the State Engineer.  That litigation was resolved by an 
order entered by the District Court in early February 2016.     
 The public interest in this case is the manner in which groundwater is dealt with in New 
Mexico.   Groundwater in New Mexico belongs to the public and speculation in water rights is 
detrimental to public welfare.  Additional groundwater depletion will dry up springs that support 
wetlands and riparian environments.  The New Mexico Environmental Law Center’s clients are 

 
2 
 
concerned that the proposed appropriation of the groundwater sought by the Ranch will dry up 
the wells on which they depend.   
 The New Mexico Environmental Law Center has neither sought nor received attorneys’ 
fees from an opposing party in this case. 
 
Cases #3, #4, and #5 
 
The following three cases all relate to the proposed Santolina development. 
 
Case #3  
 Javier Benavidez, James Santiago Maestas, Roberto Roibal, SouthWest Organizing 
Project, New Mexico Health Equity Working Group, and Pajarito Village Association v. 
Bernalillo County Board of County Commissioners, and Art De La Cruz, Wayne Johnson, 
Debbie O’Malley, Maggie Hart Stebbins, and Lonnie Talbert, Bernalillo County Commissioners, 
and Consensus Planning, Inc. and Western Albuquerque Land Holdings, LLC   
New Mexico Second Judicial District Court case D-202-CV-2015-04466 
 
Case #4  
 Javier Benavidez, James Santiago Maestas, Roberto Roibal, SouthWest Organizing 
Project, New Mexico Health Equity Working Group, and Pajarito Village Association v. 
Bernalillo County Board of County Commissioners, and Art De La Cruz, Wayne Johnson, 
Debbie O’Malley, Maggie Hart Stebbins, and Lonnie Talbert, Bernalillo County Commissioners, 
and Consensus Planning, Inc. and Western Albuquerque Land Holdings, LLC   
 New Mexico Second Judicial District Court case D-202-CV-2015-05363 
 
Case #5 
 SouthWest Organizing Project, the New Mexico Health Equity Working Group, the Pajarito 
Village Association, Javier Benavidez, Santiago James Maestas, and Roberto Roibal, v. the Bernalillo 
County Board of County Commissioners, and Art De La Cruz, Wayne Johnson, Debbie O’Malley, Maggie 
Hart Stebbins, and Lonnie Talbert, Bernalillo County Commissioners, and Consensus Planning and 
Western Albuquerque Land Holdings, LLC, 
 New Mexico Second Judicial District Court case No. D-202-CV-2015-05746          
 
These three cases all involve the proposed Santolina development, which is a proposed 
planned community that at full build out would be home to approximately 90,000 people on the 
West Mesa of Albuquerque.   
Each of the three cases was filed in the New Mexico Second Judicial District Court by 
the New Mexico Environmental Law Center on behalf of the following clients:  Javier 
Benavidez, Santiago James Maestas, Roberto Roibal, the SouthWest Organizing Project, the 
New Mexico Health Equity Working Group, and the Pajarito Village Association.  The cases 
were filed against the Bernalillo County (New Mexico) Board of County Commissioners, the 
five individual members of the Board of County Commissioners, and Consensus Planning, Inc. 
and Western Albuquerque Land Holdings, LLC, the two companies promoting the proposed 
development.     
 In the three cases, the New Mexico Environmental Law Center’s clients sought to have 
the District Court review and vacate the following five decisions made by the Board of County 
Commissioners pertaining to the proposed Santolina development: 

 
3 
 
- The Board of County Commissioners’ decision denying the appeal filed by several of 
the clients to the Board from a determination of the Bernalillo County Planning 
Commission (the “Planning Commission”) recommending that the Santolina Level A 
Master Plan be approved.   
- The Board of County Commissioners’ decision denying the appeal filed by several of 
the clients to the Board from a decision of the Planning Commission approving the 
zone map amendment for the proposed Santolina development.  
- The Board of County Commissioners’ decision approving the zone map amendment 
for the proposed Santolina development.   
- The Board of County Commissioners’ decision approving the Santolina Level A 
Master Plan.    
- The Board’s decision approving the development agreement between the Board and 
Western Albuquerque Land Holdings, LLC.   
  These three cases were filed and litigated during 2015.  In the course of that litigation, 
two of the cases (case #D-202-CV-2015-04466 and case #D-202-CV-2015-05363) were 
consolidated, and those two cases were still pending as of December 31, 2015.  The third case 
(case D-202-CV-2015-05746) was dismissed before December 31, 2015. 
 There are several public interest issues at stake in this litigation.  The first is where the 
water will come from for the proposed Santolina development.  The New Mexico Environmental 
Law Center’s clients are particularly concerned about this issue because they fear that use of 
water for the proposed Santolina development will reduce the water that is available for other 
users in the Albuquerque area, which is where each of the individual clients is located.  The 
second public interest issue is whether the proposed Santolina development will lead to 
significant increases in traffic from the west side of Albuquerque to central Albuquerque, thereby 
causing significant pollution on the roads that connect Albuquerque to the west side.  The third 
public interest is whether the children from the proposed Santolina development will exacerbate 
overcrowding that already exists in the Albuquerque Public School District schools that serve 
students on the west side of Albuquerque.  And the fourth public interest issue is whether the 
development of the proposed Santolina development will cause increases in taxes for taxpayers 
elsewhere in Bernalillo county. 
 The New Mexico Environmental Law Center has neither sought nor recovered any 
attorneys fees from an opposing party in any of these three cases.       
 
Case #6 
Boling Enterprises, et. al. v. Oil Conservation Commission, et. al.  
This is New Mexico Court of Appeals case No. 33,505. 
Background – In November and December of 2007, the New Mexico Oil Conservation 
Commission (“Commission”) held hearings on a new regulation strengthening regulation of oil 
and gas exploration and production wastes.  The New Mexico Environmental Law Center 
participated in that hearing on behalf of the Oil and Gas Accountability Project (“OGAP”) and 
presented expert testimony.   
In May 2008, the Commission promulgated the final regulation, referred to as the Pit 
Rule.  In July 2008 a number of oil and gas producers appealed the Commission’s final 
regulation to New Mexico District Court.  The New Mexico Environmental Law Center 
represented OGAP in its effort to intervene in that proceeding and its motion to intervene was 
granted. The case was dismissed as moot in August, 2016.   

 
4 
 
Public Interests Represented - Oil and gas exploration and production generates 
significant amounts of toxic wastes that can contaminate groundwater and pollute the air.  The 
Commission’s final regulation was passed with the goal of protecting groundwater.  Rather than 
simply burying toxic wastes in unlined holes in the ground where waste could contaminate 
groundwater, oil and gas producers are now required to line waste pits and are required to 
recycle waste under certain circumstances.   
Attorney Fees – No attorney fees have been requested or received by the New Mexico 
Environmental Law Center in this matter.   
 
Case #7 
Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety v. Ron Curry, Secretary of the New Mexico 
Environment Department.   
 This is case number 30,958 in the New Mexico Court of Appeals.   
 This case is an appeal of a permitting decision by the New Mexico Environment Department 
Secretary (then Ron Curry) at the end of November, 2010.  It was docketed in January, 2011.  There 
is a docketing statement on file and settlement discussions have been taking place in an attempt to 
narrow the bases of appeal.  The original permitting proceeding under appeal in this case was the 
Los Alamos National Laboratory Hazardous Waste Permits HBW O9-37(P), HBW 10-04(P).    
 The public interest in the case involves protection of people who live near Los Alamos 
National Laboratory (LANL).  Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety includes members of the 
Pueblo communities living around the LANL site, as well as people who live downstream and 
downwind of the facility.   Proper, adequate and complete clean-up of the weapons building legacy 
waste is an abiding interest of many members of these communities.  The purpose of the case is to 
either win the appellate issue or use it to force, in the settlement process, adequate clean-up of the 
facility. 
 The New Mexico Environmental Law Center has neither sought nor recovered attorneys’ 
fees from an opposing party in this case. 
 
Case #8 
 Gila Resources Information Project, Amigos Bravos, Turner Ranch Properties, L.P., 
State of New Mexico ex rel. Hector Balderas, Attorney General, and William Olson, v. New 
Mexico Water Quality Control Commission and Freeport-McMoRan Chino Mines Company, 
Freeport-McMoRan Tyrone, Inc., Freeport-McMoRan Cobre Mining Company, and the New 
Mexico Environment Department 
 New Mexico Court of Appeals cases 33,237, 33,238, and 33,245.   
 New Mexico Supreme Court cases S-1-SC-35279, 35289, and 35290.   
This is a case that was litigated in two different courts during 2015.  First, the matter was 
the subject of litigation in the New Mexico Court of Appeals in three consolidated cases:  Court 
of Appeals numbers 33,237, 33,238, and 33,245.  The Court of Appeals issued a decision in 
April, 2015, and, acting on behalf of its clients, the New Mexico Environmental Law Center 
sought review by a writ of certiorari in the New Mexico Supreme Court in Supreme Court case 
number S-1-SC-35279.  That case was subsequently consolidated with cases S-1-SC-35289 and 
35290.  The Supreme Court agreed to hear the three consolidated cases, which were pending as 
of December 31, 2015.   
These three consolidated cases involve a rule adopted by the New Mexico Water Quality 
Control Commission.  Freeport McMoRan, Inc. (Freeport) is an international copper mining 
company that owns and operates several open pit copper mines in New Mexico. At Freeport’s 

 
5 
 
request, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) proposed a new rule to allow 
contaminant discharges at copper mines to pollute groundwater. The new rule would legitimize 
the extensive existing groundwater pollution at Freeport’s mines and authorize more such 
pollution at Freeport’s and all other copper mines in the future.  The new rule was adopted by the 
New Mexico Water Quality Control Commission. 
The New Mexico Environmental Law Center is involved in this matter because under-
regulated open pit copper mines cause extensive and essentially permanent groundwater 
pollution, and approximately 90% of New Mexicans depend on groundwater as a domestic 
supply.  The copper rule not only allows ground water pollution at copper mines, but it also sets 
a dangerous precedent for other types of mines and facilities.    
The New Mexico Environmental Law Center has neither sought nor obtained attorneys’ 
fees from an opposing party in this matter. 
 
Case #9 
Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment, et. al. v. N.M. Mining Commission  
New Mexico First Judicial District Court, No. D-101-CV-2012-02318.   
Background – In 2011, the New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division (“MMD”) held a 
public hearing on Rio Grande Resources’ (“RGR”) application to renew its Mt. Taylor uranium 
mine standby permit under the New Mexico Mining Act (“Act”).  Although the New Mexico 
Environmental Law Center’s clients were prepared to present expert testimony on several aspects 
of the permit application, including the adequacy of RGR’s financial assurance for the mine and 
the adequacy of the MMD’s environmental review, the MMD refused to allow our clients’ 
testimony on these issues.  Further, the MMD withheld, in its entirety, the economic viability 
analysis for the mine that RGR was required by the Act to produce.  Acting as counsel for its 
client, the Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment (“MASE”), the New Mexico 
Environmental Law Center appealed MMD’s decision to exclude testimony to District Court and 
won on all three issues.  In the fall of 2014, RGR, MMD, and the New Mexico Environmental 
Law Center’s clients resolved which economic issues should be disclosed.      
In 2015, RGR determined that it would seek to re-open the mine, making the standby 
issues moot.  In August 2015, MMD, with the concurrence of all parties, informed the court that 
it had complied with the court's order requiring financial assurance review and disclosure of 
economic information.  The case remains open in the district court, although no further activity is 
anticipated.   
Public Interests Represented – The public interests represented in this case are the 
public’s ability to meaningfully participate in public hearings under the New Mexico Mining Act 
and the extent to which MMD can withhold economic information about a mine under the Act.   
Attorneys’ fees – The New Mexico Environmental Law Center has neither received nor 
sought attorneys’ fees in this case. 
 
Case #10 
Oil & Gas Accountability Project, et. al. v. New Mexico Oil Conservation Comm’n, et. al. 
This is New Mexico Court of Appeals case no. 33,451.  
Background – This case involves the regulation governing disposal of oil and gas wastes 
described in #6 above.  As was pointed out there, in 2008, the New Mexico Oil Conservation 
Commission adopted a new regulation (the Pit Rule) governing disposal of those wastes.  The Pit 
Rule’s chloride standard was subsequently amended in 2009 and appealed (#3, above).  Under 

 
6 
 
New Mexico’s new governor, in 2013 the Commission promulgated an entirely new Pit Rule, 
effectively rescinding and replacing the 2008 Pit Rule, including most of its important 
environmental protections.   In February, 2016, the Court of Appeals issued a decision rejecting 
all of OGAP's claims.  OGAP applied for certiorari to the New Mexico Supreme Court in March 
2016.  The Supreme Court refused to grant certiorari, and the case was closed.   
Public Interests Represented - Oil and gas exploration and production generates 
significant amounts of toxic wastes that can contaminate groundwater and pollute the air.  
Nevertheless, the Commission’s final 2013 regulation effectively eliminates all the important 
environmental public health and environmental protections that the 2008 Pit Rule provided.  The 
New Mexico Environmental Law Center’s clients appealed the 2013 Rule in order to challenge 
the legal bases of the 2013 Pit Rule.   
Attorneys’ fees – The New Mexico Environmental Law Center has neither received nor 
sought attorneys’ fees in this case. 
 
Case #11 
Oil and Gas Accountability Project v. New Mexico Oil Conservation Commission  
New Mexico Court of Appeals, No. 33,522. 
Background – This case involves the regulation governing disposal of oil and gas wastes 
described in case #6 and case #10.  As was pointed out there, the New Mexico Oil Conservation 
Commission adopted a new regulation (the Pit Rule) governing disposal of those wastes.  On 
February 27, 2009, the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division (“Division”) filed an application 
with the State Oil Conservation Commission to amend various provisions of the Pit Rule, which 
commenced an administrative action before the Commission.  Among other things, the Division 
sought to change the so-called chloride standard applicable to on-site trench burial of oil field 
waste from 250 mg/l to 3000 mg/l.  Despite its prior findings that the 250 mg/l chloride standard 
was necessary to protect public health and the environment, the Commission adopted the 3000 
mg/l standard.  The New Mexico Environmental Law Center appealed the Commission’s 
decision on behalf of the Oil and Gas Accountability Project to the New Mexico First Judicial 
District Court in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on July 29, 2009.  The District Court certified this 
appeal to the New Mexico Court of Appeals. This appeal was dismissed for mootness in August 
2016.  
Public interests represented – The processes involved in exploration for and production of 
oil and gas generate significant amounts of toxic wastes that can contaminate groundwater and 
pollute the air.  The State Oil Conservation Commission’s Pit Rule was designed to protect 
groundwater.  The weakening of the chloride standard will result in increased risk of pollution of 
groundwater.   
Attorneys’ fees – The New Mexico Environmental Law Center has neither received nor 
sought attorneys’ fees in this case.   
 
Case #12 
State of New Mexico, ex rel. Office of the State Engineer v. Elephant Butte Irrigation District, et 
al. 
 This is a case in the New Mexico District Court for the Third Judicial District.  The case 
number is CV-96-888.  
 This is a proceeding to determine the extent of water rights belonging to the New Mexico 
Copper Company [NMCC].  As the rights claimed are within the Lower Rio Grande, the adjudication 
takes place as part of the fixing of all water rights within that area.    The public interest in this case 

 
7 
 
is in protecting the water supplies for people living in the town of Hillsboro, New Mexico.  New 
Mexico Environmental Law Center represents these protesters.   They are a group of citizens who 
are members of the Percha-Animas Watershed Association and a domestic water users association 
in the town of Hillsboro, New Mexico.   They are concerned that if the total water rights claimed by 
the NMCC is allocated to it, their water supplies will be compromised.   Their intention in this 
litigation is to limit the NMCC water rights to no more than the New Mexico Office of the State 
Engineer offered to NMCC based upon proven beneficial use. 
 The New Mexico Environmental Law Center has neither sought nor recovered attorneys’ 
fees from an opposing party in this case. 
 
Case #13 
United States v. Curry  
This is a case in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico; it is case 
number 1:10-CF-01251.    
 Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety is an intervening defendant in this matter.  The 
plaintiff is the United States Department of Energy which oversees Los Alamos National Laboratory 
(LANL), which is currently operated by intervening plaintiff Los Alamos National Security, LLC.  The 
principal defendant is the New Mexico Environment Department.  Concerned Citizens for Nuclear 
Safety litigated the issue of permissive intervention in the case and was granted that status on July 
25, 2011.  Since that time the case has been in settlement negotiations.  
 The public interest involved in this matter is in the adequate clean up of the pollution 
caused by LANL.  Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety includes members of the Pueblo 
communities living around the LANL site, as well as people who live downstream and downwind of 
the facility.   Proper, adequate and complete clean-up of the weapons building legacy waste is an 
abiding interest of many members of these communities.  While CCNS, as an intervening defendant, 
has no basis for winning this case, by being "on board" it has a seat at the table in the process of 
negotiated settlement.  This provides an opportunity to strive for a settlement that will assure 
adequate clean-up of the LANL weapons building legacy waste.   
 The New Mexico Environmental Law Center has neither sought nor recovered attorneys’ 
fees in this matter. 
 
Case #14 
Vermillion et. al. v. Mora County, et. al.  
This is case no. 1:13-cv-01095 in the United States District Court for the District of New 
Mexico.  
 Background - In April 2013, the Mora County Commission (“Commission”) passed an 
ordinance that, among other things, banned oil and gas development within Mora County’s 
boundaries in order to protect public health and natural resources, particularly water, within the 
County.  One individual and several corporations sued the County, alleging that the ordinance is 
unconstitutional.  The New Mexico Environmental Law Center is providing legal counsel to the 
County in defense of its ordinance.  The Federal District Court issued an adverse ruling in a 
companion case, rendering the Vermillion case moot.  The Vermillion case was voluntarily 
dismissed in April, 2015.  The case has been closed.   
 Public Interests Represented – This case involves a challenge to a county’s fundamental 
sovereign right to protect the health, safety and resources within its boundaries.   
Attorneys’ fees – The New Mexico Environmental Law Center has neither received nor 
sought attorneys’ fees in this case.
