Dear Friends,
At the end of December, 32 years after founding the Law Center, Doug Meiklejohn moved 
from his position as Executive Director to become Founding Director. We all owe Doug a 
huge debt of gratitude for his decades of work founding the Law Center and building it to 
the force it is today, an achievement that was recognized when he received a Santa Fe 
Living Treasure award in late 2019.
This leadership transition ushers in a momentous new era for the Law Center. We have 
started the search for a new Executive Director to lead the Law Center into the future, and 
are hiring two staff attorneys. In addition, the board and staff have taken the first steps 
toward incorporating a greater focus on inclusion and diversity. Environmental justice has 
been our mission for nearly 30 years, but we realized the need to be more intentional in 
developing internal diversity and equity policies to help better reflect external diversity 
and equity work and to improve our partnerships with clients and partners across the 
state.
Meanwhile, the past year brought significant legal developments as well. The collective 
effort of Law Center attorneys and our clients forced the Mt. Taylor zombie uranium mine 
to finally close and begin reclamation. We began working with local communities and 
statewide organizations to resist a proposed mining exploration project in the upper Pe-
cos watershed. Finally, we had two successful outcomes to years-long challenges to at-
tempted corporate water grabs when judges denied both the Aquifer Science permit 
application in the East Mountains near Albuquerque and the Augustin Plains Ranch appli-
cation in Catron and Socorro Counties.
Y our generous support has made all these significant developments possible. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Eric Jantz

How you made a difference in 2019
Your generosity made it possible for us to work on these important cases
LAND
The Law Center started and ended 2019 with two important uranium mining-related cases. In January, on 
behalf of the Red Water Pond Road Community Association, we filed a report with the United Nations 
Human Rights Committee, arguing that the United States’ response to cleaning up historic uranium min-
ing and processing waste and permitting new uranium mines violates the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR). Then, in December, in a stunning victory for Native communities, Rio Grande 
Resources, owner of the Mt Taylor uranium mine, notified the state Mining and Minerals Division that 
it would cease mining operations and soon begin closure plan activity. Unfortunately, some of the dam-
age to the area around this site is irreversible. (Clients: Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment and 
Amigos Bravos).
New World Cobalt submitted an application in June for 
exploratory mining for copper, zinc and gold at the pro-
posed Tererro Mine north of Pecos. We worked with 
our client, the Upper Pecos Watershed Association, to 
submit comments on the application requesting strin-
gent pollution prevention measures and have been 
working closely with other environmental and wildlife 
organizations to develop strategies that get out ahead 
of any eventual mining activity.
AIR
The Law Center has several air quality cases in the South Valley of Albuquerque and Bernalillo Coun-
ty. The most significant of these is a Title VI Civil Rights Complaint, which the SouthWest Organizing 
Project filed in 2014 with the US Environmental Protection Agency against the City and County. The 
complaint asserted that local decision-makers have marginalized minority communities, exposing them 
to “an unequal burden of air pollution and the concomitant adverse health effects.” The complaint is now 
under negotiation with the City. Mediation could result in a process for a community-specific air quality 
monitoring program, a cumulative air impacts ordinance, and an environmental justice ordinance.
After President Trump eliminated the Obama-era Methane Rule for oil and gas operations on federal 
land, Governor Lujan Grisham established an Advisory Panel to clarify technical issues associated with 
an eventual state methane rule. The Law Center was represented on the panel, which issued a techni-
cal report at the end of 2019, and we will help draft the new rule and ensure effective public comment.
WATER
As part of the Trump administration’s war against environmental and health regulation, the US Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a change to the “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) 
Rule, which defines what waters are protected by the federal Clean Water Act. The Law Center wrote 
extensive comments on the proposed rule. In early January 2020, the EPA published the final rule, un-
der which the vast majority of surface waters in the state will lose all federal protection against pollution. 
The Law Center is likely to join one of the many law suits that will be filed in this matter. (Clients: Amigos 
Bravos & Gila Resources Information Project).

In May, we sent a Notice of Intent (NOI) to sue to the US Air Force over its handling of groundwater contam-
ination from the bulk fuel leak at Kirtland Air Force Base. Discussions with the Air Force stalled and in 
February 2020, the Law Center filed suit against the Air Force. In a separate case, the Law Center’s clients 
filed an Amici Curiae – “Friends of the Court” – brief supporting the New Mexico Attorney General and the 
New Mexico Environment Department litigation to get the Air Force to conduct prompt cleanup of per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at Cannon Air Force Base and Holloman Air Force Base. (Kirtland 
clients: SouthWest Organizing Project, New Mexico Voices for Children, State Senator Antoinette Sedillo 
Lopez, State Senator Mimi Stewart, State Representative G. Andres Romero, and three individual residents 
of the impacted area; PFAS clients: the above three state legislators).
Thanks to your support, we have had success with an issue that will become more common as climate 
change affects surface water availability: groundwater withdrawal permit applications. In January, a State 
District Court judge denied the groundwater pumping application of Aquifer Science in the East Mountain 
area of Albuquerque. The judge ruled that over 100 domestic wells would be impaired by the proposed 
pumping and – importantly – that the Applicant and the Office of the State Engineer (OSE) did not consider 
climate change science and the impact of future drought. In a subsequent ruling on cost recovery, a judge 
found that the OSE was liable for part of the cost for expert witness fees and related costs. Both Aquifer Sci-
ence and the OSE have appealed. Our clients won another victory in the 12-year struggle against Augustin 
Plains Ranch (APR) for a State Engineer permit to withdraw 17 billion gallons of groundwater annually. 
Both APR and the OSE have appealed. New Mexico Copper Corporation (NMCC) sought to acquire water 
rights for use at a proposed copper mine near Hillsboro, NM. A December 2017 court decision on the Cop-
per Flat Mine Water Rights Adjudication significantly limited the amount of water available to the mine. In 
April 2019, we filed a cross-appeal, arguing that the original decision needed to go further and find that the 
claimants have no available water rights. (Aquifer Science clients; more than 50 individuals; Agustin Plains 
Ranch clients: nearly 100 ranchers, farmers & other property holders; Copper Flat Water clients: Hillsboro 
Mutual Domestic Water Users Association).
We appealed the Water Quality Control Commission’s (WQCC) newly adopted Water Quality Act Variance 
Rule with the New Mexico Court of Appeals, arguing that the new rule violates several aspects of the New 
Mexico Water Quality Act, in part by limiting public participation and by granting variances in perpetuity. 
(Clients: Amigos Bravos & Gila Resources Information Project).
In June, the Water Quality Control Commission (WQCC) sup-
ported our Motion to Vacate and Remand the Petition for 
Review of groundwater discharge permit DP-1132 for Los 
Alamos National Laboratory's (LANL) Radioactive Liquid 
Waste Treatment Facility. The Motion was based on the fact 
that the Hearing Officer, at the time of the hearing on the 
permit, had a job application at LANL and subsequently was 
hired by the Lab. We are also nearing the end of a case in-
volving the 2005 Consent Order between the NMED and 
LANL management. Under the Order, LANL missed multiple deadlines and accrued potentially $300 
million in fines. Governor Martinez’ Environment Department adopted a new Consent Order in 2016 that 
lacked deadlines or enforcement mechanisms for cleanup. We sued and a federal District Court judge al-
lowed the case to move forward, including possible civil penalties, stating that neither the Department of 
Energy nor Lab management had been able to document that violations had stopped or that they would 
not occur in the future. (DP-1132 clients: Communities for Clean Water; Consent Order client: Nuclear Watch 
New Mexico).
Thank you for protecting New Mexico’s land, air, water and communities!
