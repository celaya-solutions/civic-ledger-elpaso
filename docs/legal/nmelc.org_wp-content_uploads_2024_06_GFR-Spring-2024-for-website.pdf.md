NEW MEXI CO ENVI RONMENTAL LAW CENTER 
BY VIRGINIA NECOCHEA, PHD

 The thematic hearing has already increased public awareness and 
has helped open the door to further conversation with federal
agencies about mine waste disposal. 
Representatives from the Navajo Nation, Havasupai Tribe, Northern Arapaho Nation, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and Oglala
Lakota Tribe of the Great Sioux Nation gave powerful testimony to the IACHR about how uranium development has
devastated their communities and cultures. The representatives from the Navajo Nation testified about how living beside
uranium mine waste piles had turned their community from a thriving place where extended families lived together to a place
that is all but deserted because of disease and families making the difficult decision to move away to protect their health. The
representatives from Ute Mountain Ute Tribe described how living beside the only operational uranium mill in the U.S. has
prevented them from expressing their cultural identity because contamination from the mill has befouled their medicinal plants,
ceremonial waters and the game they hunted. The representative from the Oglala Lakota Tribe testified how legacy mines and
ongoing in situ leach uranium mining has contaminated waters tribal members use for drinking and for ceremonies.  
In stark contrast, the delegation from the United States spent the bulk of its time congratulating themselves on how much
outreach to tribes has improved and how much money they were planning to spend on tribal programs. Of the agencies
represented—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Interior
—only the EPA even hinted that the federal government held any responsibility for pollution from uranium exploitation.  
After the hearing concluded, the Indigenous community representatives conducted follow-up visits with the EPA, elected
officials and the IACHR’s Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Issues. The thematic hearing has already increased public
awareness and has helped open the door to further conversation with federal agencies about mine waste disposal. We anticipate
that further engagement with the Inter-American system will provide communities with greater leverage in holding the U.S.
government accountable for the longstanding impacts and harm stemming from the toxic legacy of uranium contamination.   
After the historic promotional visit by Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) Commissioner Roberta
Clarke and Commissioner Esmeralda Arosamena de Troitiño to the Pueblo of Laguna and the Navajo Nation in 2023 to see
firsthand how uranium exploitation has affected Native communities, the IACHR held a thematic hearing on the human rights
violations resulting from the United States’ uranium exploitation policies. The hearing on February 28 during the
Commission’s 189th Period of Sessions was the first time the IACHR devoted a thematic hearing exclusively to how the
U.S.’s policies on uranium exploitation have affected Indigenous communities.

Rights (IACHR) Hearing in DC
CASE UPDATES
BY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR 


This option would remove the mine waste entirely from the Red Water Pond Road and Pipeline Road communities. It would
require that the Quivira waste be disposed of in lined, subgradient trenches, equipped with leak detection systems. The
disposal facility would be located five miles from any population center. After the trenches are filled, they would be covered
with an evapotranspiration cover and monitored in perpetuity. In short, the Red Rock Landfill facility would be a state-of-the
art disposal facility.  
For almost two decades, the residents of Red Water Pond Road have been demanding that the EPA remove mine waste from
their community and they have finally been heard. Unfortunately, much misinformation has been circulating about the risks
associated with transporting the Quivira waste and the safety of the disposal facility. The frontline communities who have
been most harmed are undaunted and will continue to advocate for offsite and off-Navajo Nation waste removal. 
Quivira Waste Removal Proposal/Red Water Pond
Road Community
BY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR
On March 23, 2024, the U.S. EPA published its Engineering Evaluation/Cost Assessment (EE/CA) on the Quivira mine
Superfund cleanup and have, for the first time, responded to the Community’s demands. The Quivira mine complex has just
over 1 million cubic yards of waste rock that is located within the Red Water Pond Road and Pipeline Road communities.
These two Navajo communities have lived immediately adjacent to the Quivira waste piles for decades. The EPA proposed
four different alternatives for remediating the waste, but its preferred alternative is to transport the Quivira mine waste out
of the Red Water Pond Road and Pipeline Road communities and place it in a geotechnically safe facility off the Navajo
Nation on the Red Rock Landfill property. 
 For almost two decades, the residents of Red Water Pond Road
have been demanding that the EPA remove mine waste from
their community and they have finally been heard. 


On December 4, 2023, the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board heard the Mountain View Coalition’s
(MVC) petition on the proposed Health, Environment and Equity Impacts (HEEI) regulation that would have required the
City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department (EHD) to address the air pollution burden impacting communities
that live with a disproportionate concentration of polluting industries and negative health impacts. The highly-contentious
hearing lasted six days, ending on December 11, 2023 at 8pm, with the Board adopting a very limited version of the HEEI
rule. 
Mountain View Coalition/HEEI Hearing & Its Aftermath 
BY MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR 
During the hearing, the MVC and its allies presented substantial evidence indicating the need for the proposed HEEI rule
and demonstrating how the HEEI rule would have addressed the cumulative impacts of air pollution disproportionately
impacting Albuquerque’s low-income communities of color and put an end to the EHD’s ongoing discriminatory air
permitting practices. Specifically, the HEEI regulation would have prohibited polluting operations from locating within a
mile of any overburdened community when that operation would substantially increase the risk of cancer or respiratory
diseases in the overburdened community. If the operation would not substantially increase the risk of cancer or respiratory
disease, the operation would still have to implement stringent pollution control technologies, pollution monitoring and
reporting measures in order to obtain an air pollution permit. At the 11th hour, as a result of major stressors and political
pressure placed on the Air Board, the HEEI Rule was finally adopted; however, it merely requires the use of specific
pollution control technology by polluting sources located within one mile of an overburdened community. 
Industry parties, alongside the EHD and the Albuquerque City Council, worked tirelessly to prevent the adoption of the
HEEI rule, with the Albuquerque City Council going so far as to adopt legislation deeming the rulemaking illegal on the
second day of the hearing. 
The City Council’s actions have resulted in three lawsuits pending before three district court judges surrounding the
validity and legality of the City Council legislation. On December 5, 2023, the Air Board filed the lawsuit, Albuquerque-
Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board and the Board of County Commissioners of the County of Bernalillo v. City
of Albuquerque, New Mexico, challenging the validity of the Council’s Resolution and Ordinance and the City’s illegal
interference with the Rulemaking Proceeding. On December 11, 2023, industrial permittees and commercial associations
filed the lawsuit, GCC Rio Grande, Inc., et al. v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board, City of
Albuquerque, 
 Industry parties, alongside the EHD and Albuquerque City Council,
worked tirelessly to prevent the adoption of the HEEI rule, with 
City Council going so far as to adopt legislation deeming the 
rulemaking illegal
  

challenging the validity of the adopted HEEI Rule and the Air Board’s authority and jurisdiction to adopt the HEEI Rule. On
December 11, 2023, Complainants filed their lawsuit, Mountain View Community Action et al. v. City of Albuquerque, also
challenging the validity and legality of the Council’s Resolution and Ordinance, as well as the City’s illegal interference with
the Rulemaking Proceeding and Complainants’ constitutional right to petition the government. To date, all three lawsuits are
ongoing. Most recently, on January 25, 2024, the Air Board received a favorable ruling in their case, with the issuance of a
preliminary injunction against the City of Albuquerque, enjoining the City from enforcing the Resolution and Ordinance until
the merits of the matter are resolved.
In addition to the lawsuits pending before the district court, three groups, including National Technology and Engineering
Solutions of Sandia (NTESS), a subsidiary of Honeywell International and the contractor that operates Sandia National Lab,
and the EHD, have filed appeals of the rule adopted by the Air Board to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, asserting, among
other things, that the Air Board did not have the authority to adopt such a rule. The Mountain View Coalition has intervened
in the Court of Appeals proceedings to defend the rule adopted by the Board and ensure their communities are protected. 
 Santa Fe Civil Rights Complaint
BY MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & KACEY HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY
On September 15, 2021, NMELC clients, with the advice of NMELC, filed a civil rights complaint with the United States
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) External Civil Rights Compliance Office (ECRCO). Specifically, our client
alleged that the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) discriminated against our client and their primarily
Spanish-speaking community on the Southside of Santa Fe by denying our client and others the use of a Spanish-language
interpreter during an asphalt plant hearing, in violation of their civil rights. EPA accepted the complaint for investigation and
promptly began conversations to resolve the issue with NMED. Since 2021, however, communications with ECRCO have
been limited—but NMED’s discrimination against New Mexicans with limited English proficiency has not. 
On May 10, 2024, NMELC filed additional evidence of NMED’s intentional discrimination against New Mexicans with
limited English proficiency, showing that the hearing officer that denied a primarily-Spanish speaking resident the use of an
interpreter and ultimately issued an air pollution permit to an asphalt plant located less than one mile from low-income
community members and community members of color on Santa Fe’s Southside later denied a similar air pollution permit
application for a facility to be located more than one mile away from a primarily white, English-speaking affluent
community in Alto, New Mexico. We are currently awaiting any additional response from ECRCO and NMED. 
 Santolina Development 
BY MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & KACEY HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY
Since 2015, NMELC has partnered with clients and communities in a battle to protect the limited water resources of the
Middle Rio Grande region. The proposed Santolina development on Albuquerque’s West Side would use more than 3.8
billion gallons of water per year, but the developers have never been able to obtain the required water availability agreement
from the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority. The proposed development project has never broken
ground, in large part due to delays and opposition from our dedicated and tenacious clients, in partnership with NMELC
attorneys and other community allies.
Despite several rounds of decision-making and approval by the Bernalillo County Board of County Commissioners, the
proposed Santolina Development still sits vacant, primarily due to the lack of a need for, and water supply to, the
Development. In October 2023, the University of New Mexico’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research (BBER)
published its report entitled the “Potential Impacts of Santolina Development,” confirming what clients and the Contra
Santolina Working Group have said for over a decade: the Santolina Development will result in a net-cost to the residents of
Bernalillo County in violation of the Planned Communities Criteria and the data relied on by the Santolina developers
resulted in growth and development targets that were overstated, unreasonable, and overly optimistic. In addition to these
flawed and unlikely development goals, water scarcity and drought in New Mexico is only increasing, such that any
additional development in Bernalillo County would almost certainly harm and impact current water users in the area. 
NMELC is continuing to work alongside the Contra Santolina Working Group to urge the Bernalillo County Commission to
review its 2015 approval of the Santolina Development and reconsider whether the Santolina Master Plan is valid, or needed
at all, in Bernalillo County. 

Augustin Plains Ranch Water Grab
BY ANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY & MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY 
At a momentous hearing on April 5, 2024, more than 100 community members from Catron County crowded the court room
and hallways of the Seventh Judicial District court in Reserve, New Mexico to hear oral argument on the Augustin Plains
Ranch LLC’s (APR) continuing and relentless requests to mine and hoard 54,000 acre feet of water a year from the arid San
Augustin Plains. District Court Judge Roscoe Woods heard arguments from APR and the many allied parties opposing the
water transfer including the State Engineer Water Rights Division, the Catron County Board of County Commissioners, the
Helen Hand Ranch, and two groups of area residents protesting the transfer including one group represented by NMELC. 
Agreeing that APR’s request to transfer this groundwater is pure speculation, meaning that APR had failed to show a genuine
need to pump and hoard the groundwater, Judge Woods ruled from the bench and denied the water transfer because it is
contrary to New Mexico law. The Judge granted the State Engineer’s Motion for Summary Judgment, ultimately preventing
APR from pumping water from 30 proposed wells, which APR hoped to pipe upstate to municipalities north of Socorro such
as Los Lunas and Belén. Since 2007, NMELC has fought alongside Catron County residents against APR’s water grab and to
protect the water which residents rely on for their homes, gardens and livestock. 
This decision marks a major win for water, people and ecosystems. The long course of the APR litigation has included two
speculative, nearly identical applications from APR to appropriate groundwater and multiple appeals from the State
Engineer’s decisions denying these applications to both the district court and the New Mexico Court of Appeals. This
decision, again denying APR’s application, will be precedential for the State Engineer moving forward in determining when
applications to transfer water are speculative and the applicants do not show an imperative need for the water they seek. It is
our hope that APR will finally take NO! for an answer.  
New Case: Sunland Park/Santa Teresa Water Crisis 
BY KACEY HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY; & ANN
MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY
For years, the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority (CRRUA) has provided Southern New Mexico residents in Sunland
Park, Santa Teresa, and surrounding colonias (rural communities within the US-Mexico border region that lack adequate
water, sewer, or decent housing due to government neglect) with unsafe drinking water. On multiple occasions over the past
several years, arsenic contaminant levels in CRRUA-provided consumer water have remained well above the federal health
standards and maximum contaminant levels established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in one instance,
testing 80 percent above the federal health standards. 
This ongoing water quality crisis hit its peak in the late winter of 2023, when residents began reporting, via social media,
slimy, discolored, odorous, and foul-tasting water. While CRRUA failed to respond or act for days, a later investigation by the
New Mexico Environment Department uncovered arsenic contamination in the CRRUA water supply, and the fact that three
CRRUA arsenic treatment plants had been “offline and bypassed” for more than a year.
After receiving a request for assistance from local community members in February 2024, NMELC is now working alongside
the community in their efforts to obtain safe and clean drinking water, as well as more transparency and accountability from
CRRUA. NMELC continues to support community-led efforts as this ongoing water crisis develops and changes on a nearly
daily basis.
