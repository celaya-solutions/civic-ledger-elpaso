Trump's $50 billion healthcare boost targets crisis in rural America
WASHINGTON (TNND) — An unprecedented federal investment is on its way to rural communities across the nation to help improve healthcare.
The Trump administration is doling out $50 billion in awards in all 50 states.
Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said it is the largest program of its kind.
“The $50 billion represents a 50% increase in the amount of money they were putting into rural areas for Medicaid,” Oz said during an interview with The National News Desk Taylor Murray on Friday. “And just to put it in context, Taylor, if you live in rural America, your life expectancy is shorter. We’re having a major problem in this country because your zip codes are dictating your life expectancy. You don’t have access to care. There’s not availability of newer technologies. We have problems with maternity mortality rates -- all kinds of problems.”
Oz said that’s why President Donald Trump, along with Congress, is giving $50 billion -- $1 billion to each state – over the course of five years. He said the point of the money is not to pay the bills, but to revamp the program and get to the root cause of why it’s not functional.
“For example, can we improve the technology that’s available so you get tele-medicine or even technology within hospitals so they can take better care of patients?” Oz said. “How do we connect the bigger hospitals to the smaller hospitals? How do we get people to go work in rural America?”
Oz said much of what holds back rural America to be healthy are “old-fashioned rules that just need to be changed.”
