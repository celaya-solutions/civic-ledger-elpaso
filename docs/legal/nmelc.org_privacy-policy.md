THE NEW MEXICO ENVIRONMENTAL LAW CENTER — PRIVACY POLICIES
The New Mexico Environmental Law Center is committed to protecting the privacy of our members, supporters and all visitors to our website.
NMELC Website Visitors
To help us improve our website, we may gather information about visitors to our website such as the pages visited, the amount of time spent on the site, the kind of browser used and the referring web page that brought you to our website. Absolutely no personal information is collected.
Click-Through URLS
In some of our e-mail communications, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on our websites. When users click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We may track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the e-mail messages.
NMELC Website Purchases and Donations
For visitors purchasing merchandise or giving donations via the NMELC website, we collect information such as your name, address, telephone number, credit card information and your e-mail address on our secure transaction form. This information is necessary to fulfill your request and, if necessary, to communicate with you about your request. We will add your name and address to our database to keep you informed of our work and of the progress of our cases.
Sharing Information with Third Parties
The New Mexico Environmental Law Center does not share your personal information with third parties.
