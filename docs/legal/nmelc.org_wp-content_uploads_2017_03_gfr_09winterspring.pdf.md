New Ordinance Out of the Ordinary 
“
”
After more than a year of work,
Santa F e County is now home 
to the best oil and gas ordinance
in the nation.
Throughout the process, Law Center Staff
Attorneys Eric Jantz and Bruce Frederick
represented Drilling Santa Fe,
a grassroots organization
based in the Galisteo Basin.
We worked with dozens of
concerned individuals and
organizations to advocate for
the new ordinance, which
was drafted by the County
and national land-use experts.
“This Ordinance is testament
to what can happen when you
bring together determined 
citizens, organizations that 
are knowledgeable in the law
and science of an issue, and a
government that does not 
bow and scrape to industry,” 
says Jantz.
Not everyone is happy with the new law,
however. “You can’t let some county com-
mission mandate that you’re gonna drive on
paved roads and pay for police and fire,”
Bob Gallagher, President of theNM Oil and
Gas Association(NMOGA),told the
Albuquerque
Journal. He maintains that the
ordinance will make it impossible for oil and
gas development to occur in the Galisteo
Basin, and has promised that NMOGA will
sue to overturn the Ordinance, although that
lawsuit has yet to materialize.  
“This will not make it impossible to drill,”
rebuts Jantz. “What it will do, for the first
time in New Mexico, is ensure that oil and
gas drillers will have to be good neighbors.
It is just common sense that it will take
several layers of protection to guarantee 
that an inherently toxic industry can operate
as a good neighbor.”
Jantz does not believe that the fight is
over, however. In addition to a future 
possible lawsuit, Law Center attorneys
worked vigorously to defeat bad legislation
and support good bills, such as the 
Free
Market in Energy Restoration Act,
sponsored by Brian Egolf, which would
have provided new protections for land-
owners who do not own their mineral rights.
Anatomy of the Ordinance
The Santa Fe County Oil and Gas
Ordinance seeks to “promote 
the health, safety and welfare of 
the County, its residents, and its 
environment by regulating
adverse public nuisance and / or
land use impacts and effects
resulting from the exploration,
drilling, operation, and 
transportation of oil and gas.”
Some precedent-setting
aspects of the Ordinance:
• Significant baseline studies and
modeling will be required before
permits are issued.
• Ecologically- and culturally-
sensitive areas have been identi-
fied, and will be closed to drilling.
• Companies will be required 
to use non-toxic fluids to fracture underground
rock strata in order to release oil and gas for
pumping to the surface.
• Drillers, rather than taxpayers, will be
required to pay for new County services such
as road paving and public safety that would
accompany the growth of the industry.
• Drillers must keep surface disturbance to
a minimum.

Case Updates
Hard-Fought Victory at Tyrone Copper Mine 
Toxic Drilling Wastes are the Pits
In a case that traces its roots back to a
2003 groundwater discharge permit, the Law
Center and client Gila Resources Information
Project (GRIP), and the NM Environment
Department (NMED) prevailed in our efforts
to force Freeport McMoRan (formerly
Phelps Dodge Mining Co.) to clean up the
contaminated groundwater under its massive
Tyrone pit – the 5th largest open-pit mine in
the U.S.
On January 13, 2009, the NM Water
Quality Control Commission upheld two
key disputed conditions in the discharge 
permit that require the company to re-grade
and cover thousands of acres  of waste rock
piles that would otherwise generate acid
rock drainage and contaminate groundwater.
“In an arid state like New Mexico that is so
dependent on groundwater supplies, we 
cannot afford to use our aquifers as waste
dumps,” says Allyson Siwik, Executive
Director of GRIP. “We need every drop.
NMED issued a solid permit back in 2003,
and the Commission made the right decision
in supporting it.”
The company had argued that ground-
water supplies under the Tyrone copper
mine are not required to be protected under
the NM Water Quality Act
because they would not be
used in the foreseeable future.
Further, the company posited
that it could count on 
“institutional controls” such
as signs and zoning laws to 
prevent people from using  the contami-
nated water for centuries to come.  
The Commission made several
important determinations that were
directly contrary to the company’s 
arguments.
Most importantly, it
unequivocally rejected the assertion that
land ownership and control of the land 
surface are relevant to determining whether
groundwater will be used in the future.
Instead, it directed the NMED to only  
consider objective factors, such as pre-
mining water quality, aquifer characteristics
and whether or not the water beneath the
mine may be needed in the foreseeable
future.
In March, Freeport McMoRan appealed
the ruling.  The Law Center and our client
are preparing to defend the decision before
the NM Court of Appeals later this year.

• There are an estimated 100,000
active and inactive pits in New Mexico. 
• Industry is required to report any
release of more than 210 gallons. 
• As of December 2008, the Oil
Conservation Division is aware of more
than 500 self-reported groundwater
contamination instances related to pits.
The ink was barely dry on the New
Mexico’s new Oil Pit Rule when the NM
Independent Petroleum Association,
ConocoPhillips and others sued to overturn
it NM District Court.  The new Rule, for
which the Law Center ardently advocated
in 2007, is the most stringent in the nation;
it governs the management and disposal of
toxic drilling by-products at drilling sites.  
Some requirements:  
• All temporary disposal pits must be   
permitted by the State, and all pits must   
have heavy-duty liners.
• Drillers must use “closed-loop” tanks 
near water resources, rather than storing 
wastes in open pits that can leak into 
nearby wells, rivers or groundwater. 
• A significant amount of contamination 
must be hauled to licensed disposal sites; 
waste disposed of on-site must meet 
groundwater quality standards before 
being buried.
On behalf of the Oil and Gas Accountability
Project, the Law Center intervened in the
appeal in order to defend the Rule. We are
also working to fight industry-backed efforts
to weaken the Pit Rule through other
channels; this case is unfolding as we go to
press, so please see our website for updates.
> Please see our website for Jantz’s brief, March 2008 testimony before the NM Oil
Conservation Commission about the toxic chemicals associated with oil and gas drilling, and 
for a study that demonstrates economic benefits of closed-loop waste management systems.

Work Heats Up on Climate Change Case UraniumNotes

John Fogarty, M.D., Executive Director of 
New Energy Economy , speaks about New
Mexico’s imperative to be a leader in 
addressing climate change.
This chart was developed by New Energy Economy using data compiled the New Mexico Climate
Change Advisory Group.  It gives a sector-by-sector breakout of how New Mexico can reduce its
carbon emissions by 20% by 2020.  
In January, Law Center Staff Attorney
Bruce Frederick overcame strong industry
opposition to convince the NM
Environmental Improvement Board (EIB)
to grant a hearing on reducing the state’s
greenhouse gas emissions.  On behalf of
our client, New Energy Economy, we are
petitioning the Board to adopt new regula-
tions that would dramatically reduce global
warming pollution over the next decade.
“The science is clear that global warming
is underway, and we must take immediate
action,” says Dr. John Fogarty, Executive
Director for New Energy Economy. 
We based the petition on the findings of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, a scientific entity composed of
more than 1,200 international scientists.
The Panel has concluded that developed
nations must reduce global warming 
pollution by at least 25% below 1990 levels
by 2020 to avoid catastrophic changes. 
If we are successful in our efforts,
New Mexico will lead the nation with
the most significant and strongest
regulations in the United States.

The Law Center continues to be a
national leader on uranium issues:
• We submitted comments on the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s
(NRC’s) nearly 500-page draft
Generic Environmental Impact
Statement (GEIS) for in situ leach
(ISL) uranium mining in Nebraska,
New Mexico, South Dakota and
Wyoming – all states that have
significant indigenous populations
living near uranium deposits. The GEIS
would make it easier for companies
to obtain ISL mining licenses. 
Check our website to see our
comments and the draft GEIS.
• We are still awaiting a decision
from the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals in our lawsuit to overturn
the NRC license issued to Hydro
Resources, Inc. The license would
allow the company to mine uranium
in the sole-source drinking water
aquifer for 15,000 citizens, most of
whom are Navajo. The case was
heard in Denver, CO, in May 2008.
• In addition to the GEIS, above, we
represent the Haaku Water Office of
Acoma Pueblo on two cases. 
1) We represent the Water Office in 
government-to-government consulta-
tions with federal and state agencies
on uranium matters.  2) We oppose
the granting of the state’s first 
non-minimal exploration permit for 
uranium.  Neutron Energy, the 
applicant, seeks to drill near Mt.
Taylor, a place of significant cultural
import to the Acoma people. 
• We published an economic impact
study by resource economist Thomas
Power, Ph.D., showing that a new
uranium boom will not be a boon to
New Mexico’s economy.
[ see our website to read more ]
Washington, and Massachusetts, have adopt-
ed legislation to reduce emissions in their
states, but all targets thus far fall short of
what scientists say is necessary to protect the
planet from dangerous climate change. 
A hearing before the EIB will be held in
April; if we succeed, a hearing on the merits
of the petition will be scheduled in front of
the EIB in August.

The Law Center would like to
express its heartfelt gratitude
to Jeanie Cragin, Corrine
Sanchez and Peter Stacey, 
who served on our board of
directors for 12, 10 and 
3 years, respectively.
We were guided by their insight, made
better through their talents, and inspired by
their passion to protect the communities of
New Mexico. Thank you, Jeanie, Corrine
and Peter, and we wish you well in your
other endeavors!  
In Memoriam
The Law
Center lost a
true friend with
the passing of
Edith Pierpont
in December.  
Edie sat on our
Board of
Directors 
during the
1990s, includ-
ing a term as
President.  She worked tirelessly to protect
New Mexico’s water resources, and was 
a formidable defender of the environment
in many arenas, including the State
Legislature. We will miss her.
Jeanie Cragin, who headed Friends of Santa F e
County, helped christen the Ortiz Mountains
Educational Preserve in 2003. The Preser ve is a
result of a settlement between Friends of Santa F e
County (represented by the Law Center) and 
LAC Minerals.
Unsung Heroes
“WANTED: summer interns to handle ridiculously large workload
using technology from before you were born.  You must have a
strong constitution, as you will not be paid but you will be bombarded
by the strange humor and manic pace exhibited by non-profit lawyers. ”
Once again, despite all of our demands and
few rewards, the Law Center interns
accomplished amazing things.  Lissa
Crocker, who graduated from Colorado
College in May, has been working with us
since then to develop a much-needed
interactive map that will layer data about
industrial facilities with information on
New Mexico communities. Alice Segal,
now a senior at the University of Chicago,
had the daunting task of compiling reams of
data on uranium in the Four Corners region
for use on our website.
Alice meets with client Larry King in Church Rock.  Larry, an ENDAUM board member, is a
veteran uranium activist who lives and ranches in Church Rock.
The Law Center and the Environmental
Law Society at UNM School of Law were
privileged to host 
Dr. Arjun Makhijani
at the law school in September.
Dr. Makhijani, President of the Institute for
Energy and Environmental Research, is a
world renowned expert on nuclear issues
and sustainable energy use; find a link to
his new book,

Twenty Stories
6 w w w.nmelc.org
Partners in Justice:Doug and Harriet Meiklejohn
By Don Goldman 
Law Center member since 1988. 
Ed. note: In 2008, we launched ’20 Stories for 20 Years’ in honor of
the Law Center’s twentieth anniversary.  We’re a little late, but are
happy to present the final five stories in that series. Please see our
new website for the remaining four stories.
Imagine an ambitious, talented lawyer with no corporate or
wealthy clients, whose legal aspirations do not include remunerative
civil suits or elective office; an attorney guided by family tradition
and a personal recognition that our legal system should do more to
represent the least powerful among us.  And imagine a wife who
shares those values and goals, who for over 40 years has supplied
the moral and financial support needed to make reality out of good
intentions.
This is not imagination: it is Doug and Harriet Meiklejohn.
In 1977 Doug came to New Mexico to work in the Attorney
General’s office, working first in consumer protection efforts and
last on environmental cases, a sensitivity that his parents had
instilled in him.  In 1987 however, Garrey Carruthers became
Governor and Hal Stratton the Attorney General. Doug painfully
realized that their priorities did not include his central concerns,
and that he could no longer address those concerns working for 
the state.  
The 80s were a period of increased social and environmental
activism, with people around the U.S. experimenting with new,
non-governmental ways of making change.  In that heady time of
making things better in spite of government, the Sierra Club Legal
Defense Fund, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Southern
Environmental Law Center, among others, were beginning to make
laws and the legal system work for – not against – the environment.
Moved by these non-governmental efforts to improve the
environment, Doug left state government and regular paychecks
in 1987 and founded the Law Center. With three young children, to
call this a gamble is an understatement!  But from the start, the
Law Center had an angel keeping the Meiklejohn family afloat: her
name is Harriet.  She was then – as now – a librarian. It would take
a long time for Doug to be earning “lawyer’s wages;” he’s still
waiting.  He and Harriet live in the same small house they lived in
then.
Reflecting Doug’s values, the Law Center “represents the least
powerful among us,” usually Indian tribes and poor Hispanic
communities that can’t afford legal counsel, but who live under
threats to their health or environment. Frequently, all costs of
carrying a case to conclusion are borne by grants and private
donations, not the client. Unfortunately, with its small staff and
limited resources, the Law Center has to turn away approximately
80% of the cases that come to it.  
A distinguishing Law Center characteristic is that it responds to
requests from communities.  It doesn’t tell them what they need;
the community determines its needs and the Center helps it
achieve them.  The community members stay actively involved in
the case; it’s their case, not the Center’s.  It’s been a long haul
since Doug was a full-time volunteer founder-attorney. Today the
Law Center and its staff of eight (including four attorneys) is
recognized and honored for its work on behalf of New Mexico’s
environment and communities.  Thank you, Doug and Harriet!
Reflecting Doug's values, the Law Center 
represents the "least powerful among us," 
usually communities that can't afford 
legal counsel, but who live under threats 
to their health or environment.
Of Note
On February 5, Cornell Law 
School recognized Doug 
Meiklejohn ('71) for his 
lifetime of service as a public 
interest attorney. Doug was 
accompanied to the 
ceremony in New York City 
by attorney and Law Center 
Board member Pablo Padilla, 
Jr., who nominated Doug for 
the award. Doug was also 
nominated by a classmate of his at Cornell.
Congratulations, Doug!
