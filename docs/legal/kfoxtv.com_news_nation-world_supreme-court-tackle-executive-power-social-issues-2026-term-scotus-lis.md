Supreme Court to tackle executive power, social issues in 2026 term
WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Supreme Court is set to address significant cases in 2026, focusing on the limits of presidential power and social issues with potentially far-reaching consequences. The court has already dealt with several President Donald Trump-related cases on its regular and emergency dockets.
"I think some have gone as far as to call it the Trump term. Because it's testing the boundaries of the executive's powers in a variety of places," said Zach Shemtob, the executive editor of SCOTUSblog - one of the most influential high court trackers online.
One pivotal case involves Trump's attempt to dismiss Federal Reserve board member Lisa Cook, which could impact the Fed's independence. Oral arguments are scheduled for January.
"If the court went all out and effectively gave the president carte blanche to remove...a governor of the Fed, then that would be an extremely big deal and give the president profound powers over that administrative agency. I don't think the court is likely to do that," said Shemtob.
Additionally, the court will hear cases on hot-button issues like gun rights and transgender athletes in women's sports. The most pivotal decision might be a pending one on birthright citizenship, where a looming decision could deny citizenship to babies born here to immigrant parents.
George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin says it could be a landmark decision
“Potentially hundreds of thousands of children will be deprived of birthright citizenship and be eligible for deportation, so it would affect a huge number of peopleeven people, you know, who have been U.S. citizens for years, because Trump or a future president could go back and say, well, no, you didn't correctly get U.S. citizenship," he said.
It could be a long wait for some of the decisions; the court often saves its more contentious rulings for the end of the term, which means closer to the summer.
