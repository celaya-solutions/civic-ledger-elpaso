Abbott sidesteps school funding questions amid rising education tensions in Texas
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — Across Texas, teachers are being laid off, and schools are shutting down. Meanwhile, the state government is pushing for a new school choice program.
The question is: What does this mean for public education and Texas families?
"These are essentially the first decisions that school districts are making but there is pressure across all departments. Across all schools, all grade levels across EL Paso and all of Texas," said Texas State Representative Vince Perez.
Texas school districts have faced financial struggles for years.
The last significant increase to the state’s basic allotment—the amount of money the state provides per student attending a public school—was in 2019.
Some local lawmakers and education advocates argue that schools need more resources to keep up with rising costs.
"This delegation has been fighting for increased funding for our schools for well over a decade," said State Senator César Blanco. "We've seen some increases, but we'd like to see more. Unfortunately, all schools are suffering because they don’t have sufficient funds."
As schools struggle to stay afloat, the debate over school vouchers has intensified. A school voucher allows families to use public tax dollars to pay for private school tuition—an initiative strongly backed by Governor Greg Abbott.
Abbott was in El Paso today to tout job growth, and while there, we took the chance to ask him about the impact of school vouchers and public school funding.
Despite attempts to get answers, his deputy press secretary intervened pushing our reporter, and Abbott declined to respond.
Shortly after our interaction, his press office posted on X, attributing school district budget deficits to “administrative bloat.”
Texas lawmakers are making major decisions that could reshape the state’s education system. Supporters of school choice believe it empowers families, while critics argue it diverts funds from already struggling public schools.
So, is this a step toward better education access, or does the state need to rethink its approach to public school funding?
