Minnesota faces $400 million fraud probe over COVID-era pandemic loans; Trump responds
The Small Business Administration (SBA) has suspended 6,900 Minnesota borrowers over suspected fraudulent activity related to COVID-era lending programs.
These borrowers were collectively approved for approximately 7,900 loans, totaling roughly $400 million, according to SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler.
Loeffler described the situation as "a complex scheme that was setup to defraud taxpayers, our federal government of needed funds that would have gone out during Covid for hungry families, for children, small businesses."
President Donald Trump says his administration won't stop until they figure out what happened in Minnesota.
“Actually, I view that as a reason for a good new year because we’re going to get to the bottom of [it], we’re going to get that money back. It’s all coming back," he said.
In response to these findings, the SBA will pause over $5.5 million in federal annual support to Minnesota, citing concerns about oversight failures. The implicated borrowers are now banned from all future SBA loan programs, including disaster assistance, effective immediately. Cases will be referred to federal law enforcement for potential prosecution and repayment.
The SBA's actions are part of a broader federal effort to address pandemic-era relief fraud. Multiple federal agencies, including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, have launched investigations into related schemes in Minnesota.
