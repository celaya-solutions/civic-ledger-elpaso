Law Center Fights for Pit Rule 
“
”
Staff Attorney Eric Jantz heads into court on
December 10th to defend the Oil and Gas Pit
Rule, which is being appealed by oil and gas
companies including ConocoPhillips.  The Pit
Rule, for which the Law Center successfully
advocated in 2008, protects groundwater and
land from oil and gas drilling wastes, which
often contain carcinogens such as benzene
and xylene.   
But the appeal is not the only threat that 
the regulation faces.  On the campaign trail,
Governor-elect Susana Martinez’s vowed to
abolish the Pit Rule.  Claiming that it costs
$250,000 per pit to comply (the average is
closer to $35,000 per shallow well to $150,000
per deep well, or roughly 3-5% of the total
cost of drilling a well, according to industry
experts), Martinez blamed the Pit Rule for
slowing the oil and gas industry in New
Mexico and driving drillers out of the state.
But Jantz points to a different culprit. “In a
recession, there is less demand for oil and gas
and commodity prices fall as a result.  When
the economy comes back, the drillers will
come back.  And that is when the Pit Rule
will be more important than ever.”
Jantz also points to statements from the Oil
Conservation Division that, since the Rule
was adopted, there have been no leaking pits
found in New Mexico. “Keeping these toxic
chemicals out of unlined pits means that
we’re keeping them
out of the water,” 
he adds.
The oil and gas
industry (as a
group), after the
Republican
Governors’
Association, were
the second most
generous 
contributors to
Governor-elect
Martinez’s  
campaign.
Other oil and 
gas threats on the
horizon?  In addi-
tion to a probable
attack on the Pit Rule by legislators, we
anticipate that there may be an effort to
undermine the ability of counties to enact
local zoning regulations like the Santa Fe
County Oil and Gas Ordinance. “A lot of
people worked with the Law Center to get
that ordinance enacted, and we are now
working with groups in other counties to
help them advocate for similar 
protections,” says Jantz. “We are 
ready to fight for counties’ rights 
to protect themselves from 
irresponsible oil and gas drilling.”
Can New Mexico Save the World?
Our old familiar globe is suddenly 
melting, drying, acidifying, flooding,
and burning in ways that no human
has ever seen. We’ve created, in very
short order, a new planet, still 
recognizable,but fundamentally 
different.
”
–Bill McKibben, author, in his 
public testimony to the EIB.

Case Updates
It boils down to this:  The boat is burning.
Should we grab a bucket and start throwing
water on the fire, and hope that our 
shipmates will soon pitch in?  Or should
we cozy down into deckchairs, grab our
s’mores, and hope the coast guard arrives
before we go down?
Sound like the climate change debate?
If you’re in the fossil fuel industry or a
politician, chances are that you’ve got a
marshmallow on your stick, and you’re
clamoring for national climate change 
legislation, with all its giveaways, or 
nothing. You’re probably confident that fed-
eral laws – even the weak and meaningless
kind– will not come along anytime soon.
But if you’re a New Mexican who is 
concerned about less water and more heat,
you’ve probably got your hand on a bucket.
You’re calling for a climate change proposal
that will tackle our state’s carbon emissions.
And if New Mexico springs into action,
maybe other states will, too.  
Our client, New Energy Economy, has
put forth a simple, flexible 5 page 
regulation.  It would direct our state’s power
plants, oil refineries and gas processing
plants to ratchet down their carbon dioxide
emissions from major facilities by 3% each
year for 8 years, beginning in 2013.  
This effort alone would make a serious
dent:  these facilities contribute about40%
of our annual emissions.   
2 w w w.nmelc.org
In August, during the first phase of the
public hearing on this proposed regulation,
we presented technical experts who explained
how New Mexicans face a bleak future if no
one acts.  How our plan would add less
than 1% to utility bills every year.  How
conservation measures could take carbon
out of the atmosphere and save money for
industries.  And how taking on climate
change now can position New Mexico at
the vanguard of the new green economy.  
Law Center Attorney Bruce Frederick,
with help from attorneys Mariel Nanasi of
New Energy Economy and Laura Sanchez
of the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil,
faced no fewer than eight attorneys who
represented opponents such as PNM, the
New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, and
the City of Farmington.  We anticipate that
the EIB will 
render a 
decision before
the end of the
year. It can
adopt the 
regulation as
proposed, reject
it, or adopt it
with changes.

Why Wyoming?And other puzzling questions about our uranium work
Staff Attorney and lead uranium
counsel Eric Jantz answers some of
the mostfrequent questions we
receive about our uranium work.
Q:  In 2010, the Law Center began 
working on uranium cases in Wyoming
and South Dakota. Why?
A: First, in addition to New Mexico, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) 
regulates in situ leach (ISL) uranium mining
in Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming.
So what happens in those states impacts
what will happen to our water, air and 
people. Second, the Law Center is the most
experienced non-profit law firm in the U.S.
working on uranium mining, and we’re
happy to lend our assistance to other 
communities facing the threat of mining.
Q:  Uranium mining has been almost
nonexistent for more than three decades.
What’s going on now? 
Uranium Work
October 2010
A: In 2006, our uranium docket consisted
solely of the Crownpoint Uranium Project.
This year, we have worked on 16 uranium
cases in New Mexico, South Dakota,
Wyoming, Utah and at the national level.
Why? Between 1999 and 2008, the nuclear
industry spent $650 million on 
lobbying and campaign contributions,
which has helped nuclear power regain a
foothold in Washington. Speculators, riding
on the nuclear industry's coattails, have
hopes that talk of new power plants will
spur new domestic uranium mining. 
Q:  The uranium industry touts ISL
mining as ‘controllable,’ ‘safe,’ and 
‘environmentally benign’.  
How can it say that?
A: The industry and regulators describe
ISL mining as safe and benign for a couple
of reasons. First, there are no underground
workers in ISL mines. Second, there are no
tailings piles, so ISL mines throw off less
radioactive air emissions than mines with
tailings. But that is where the truth ends.
Our opponents are trying very hard to get
investors, and are working to relax 
regulations. So they do not talk about the
true danger of this mining. ISL mining
entails the intentional contamination of
aquifers with uranium and other heavy
metals – and it’s extremely difficult to clean
up. In fact, not one mine in the world has
been cleaned up to pre-mining condition.
Q:  You filed the Law Center’s first 
petition to the U.S. Supreme Court.
What happened?
A: We asked the federal Supreme Court to
review the appellate decision that upheld
Hydro Resources’ license to mine uranium
in the aquifer that supplies drinking water
to the Crownpoint-Church Rock region.
Unfortunately, in November 2010, the 
justices declined our petition.  But this fight
is far from over.
Q:  Any last thoughts?
A: I would like to take this opportunity to
once again thank our donors and funders
who have made this work possible. Our
clients have no money to hire lawyers, and
they could not mount a successful fight
against these mining companies and the
federal government without legal help.
Without your generosity, I know that new
uranium mines would be contaminating
the people and environment of New
Mexico right now.  So please know that
your gift has made a difference in the lives
of thousands of people.  Thank you.

Don’t mess with Texas (trash)
Twenty years after he first worked with residents of Sunland Park to fight the Camino
Real landfill, Executive Director Douglas Meiklejohn is again opposing the permitting of
the facility.  In September he filed a motion to the New Mexico Environment
Department (NMED) Secretary Ron Curry, asking him to deny Waste Connection’s
application for a 10 year permit.
“For years, El Paso’s trash ended up in Sunland
Park, to the tune of nearly 90% of the waste in the
landfill.  However, in August 2010, the City of El
Paso adopted an ordinance that will keep El
Paso’s waste in El Paso,” explains Meiklejohn.
“This means that the waste stream to Sunland
Park will dry up, and the landfill’s representation
that almost all of its waste will come from El Paso
is not accurate.”
Waste Connections responded in late
September;  Secretary Curry is slated to make his
decision about the permit by November 1st.  
Comings & Goings
The Law Center welcomes two new board members: Harry Browne of Silver City, and
Michael Casaus of Albuquerque.  Harry served for several years as the Executive
Director of the Gila Resources Information Project (GRIP), and Michael is the Sierra
Club’s Senior Field Organizing Director for New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Texas.
At the same time, we bid farewell to Dale Pontius, an incredible board member and
president who injected a great deal of energy into the organization. Finally, thank you
to our wonderful summer interns, Cole Merrick and Joel Minor.
Mount Taylor uranium mine kept on standby 
by Colorado
The Mount Taylor uranium mine is not going to reopen anytime soon, thanks to a law
passed by the State of Colorado this spring.  Ore from the Mount Taylor mine, which is
owned by General Atomics, was slated to be milled at the company’s Cotter mill in
Cañon City, CO. But Colorado adopted a law in May 2010 that prevents the mill (which
was classified as a Superfund site during the 1980s) from accepting new uranium until it
cleans up its existing mess.
In response, General Atomics
shut down the Cotter 
facility in August, 2010.
Community Takes on One of New Mexico’s Worst Neighbors
Residents defy company to advocate for clean air
“I don’t believe I’ve come across a company that is so unwilling to 
do the right thing.”
Those aren’t the words of our clients, the neighbors who comprise
the Mesquite Community Action Committee (MCAC).  Those of the
words of NMED Secretary Ron Curry, describing the Helena
Chemical company. 
The Helena Chemical fertilizer blending facility in Mesquite has 
an extensive track record of air quality and water quality violations.
After neighbors fought for years to stop the plant from polluting 
their community, Helena sued MCAC member Arturo Uribe for
defamation.  A jury awarded the company $2 in damages and $75,000
in punitive damages. (The award has since been reduced, and Uribe 
continues to appeal.)
Despite the company’s heavy-handed tactics, neighbors refuse to
back down.    
In 2005, the Law Center helped MCAC successfully demand that
the company obtain an air quality permit.  But three years (and 15 
violations) later, the company entered into a fight with NMED, 
arguing that it does not require the permit.  Now the matter is before
the Environmental Improvement Board (EIB), which handles air 
quality permit appeals. 
In July, Law Center
Staff Attorney Jon
Block traveled to
Mesquite to help
neighbors prepare 
testimony for an EIB
hearing.  At the 
hearing, residents
spoke about dust
escaping from the
blending facility, about
facility doors left open,
and about their 
exasperation from 
living next door to a
company that flouts
the law.
We are awaiting a
decision from the EIB as to whether or not the company requires the
air quality permit.  If the EIB rules in favor of the company, we will
consult with the MCAC as to whether it wishes to appeal.   
Law Center intern Cole Merrick traveled with Jon to document the
trip.  In addition to his photo documentation of Jon Block, MCAC 
members (including Arturo, in beard and sunglasses), and the facility
(right), Cole submitted an affidavit to the hearing officer detailing his
first-hand account of the trip.

Law Center Fights for Pit Rule 
“
”
Staff Attorney Eric Jantz heads into court on
December 10th to defend the Oil and Gas Pit
Rule, which is being appealed by oil and gas
companies including ConocoPhillips.  The Pit
Rule, for which the Law Center successfully
advocated in 2008, protects groundwater and
land from oil and gas drilling wastes, which
often contain carcinogens such as benzene
and xylene.   
But the appeal is not the only threat that 
the regulation faces.  On the campaign trail,
Governor-elect Susana Martinez’s vowed to
abolish the Pit Rule.  Claiming that it costs
$250,000 per pit to comply (the average is
closer to $35,000 per shallow well to $150,000
per deep well, or roughly 3-5% of the total
cost of drilling a well, according to industry
experts), Martinez blamed the Pit Rule for
slowing the oil and gas industry in New
Mexico and driving drillers out of the state.
But Jantz points to a different culprit. “In a
recession, there is less demand for oil and gas
and commodity prices fall as a result.  When
the economy comes back, the drillers will
come back.  And that is when the Pit Rule
will be more important than ever.”
Jantz also points to statements from the Oil
Conservation Division that, since the Rule
was adopted, there have been no leaking pits
found in New Mexico. “Keeping these toxic
chemicals out of unlined pits means that
we’re keeping them
out of the water,” 
he adds.
The oil and gas
industry (as a
group), after the
Republican
Governors’
Association, were
the second most
generous 
contributors to
Governor-elect
Martinez’s  
campaign.
Other oil and 
gas threats on the
horizon?  In addi-
tion to a probable
attack on the Pit Rule by legislators, we
anticipate that there may be an effort to
undermine the ability of counties to enact
local zoning regulations like the Santa Fe
County Oil and Gas Ordinance. “A lot of
people worked with the Law Center to get
that ordinance enacted, and we are now
working with groups in other counties to
help them advocate for similar 
protections,” says Jantz. “We are 
ready to fight for counties’ rights 
to protect themselves from 
irresponsible oil and gas drilling.”
Can New Mexico Save the World?
Our old familiar globe is suddenly 
melting, drying, acidifying, flooding,
and burning in ways that no human
has ever seen. We’ve created, in very
short order, a new planet, still 
recognizable,but fundamentally 
different.
”
–Bill McKibben, author, in his 
public testimony to the EIB.
