Case Work: Land
Mount Taylor Mine Return to Active Status
INITIATION DATE: August 2014
CLIENTS/PARTNERS: Amigos Bravos and Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment (MASE)
OPPOSING PARTIES: New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division, Rio Grande Resources
STATUS: Ongoing
ATTORNEYS: Eric Jantz
SUMMARY:
The Cold War-era Mount Taylor uranium mine stopped producing ore in 1990. Rio Grande Resources received its first Standby permit in 1999. Under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act, operators are allowed a maximum of 20 years in Standby status through up to 4 permits of 5 years maximum each. Standby allows an operator to temporarily halt production without having to close and cleanup its mine while waiting for conditions to improve so production can start again. The operator is supposed to prevent contamination from leaving the mine site, but the Mt Taylor mine continues to leak contamination into groundwater. This case is significant because of the culturally-sensitive lands that the mine impacts and because it includes a potentially precedent-setting test of how the Mining Act is enforced against “zombie” mines – mines that are neither operational nor cleaning up. In December 2019, Rio Grande Resources suddenly announced it was closing the mine and would move to remediate the site.
