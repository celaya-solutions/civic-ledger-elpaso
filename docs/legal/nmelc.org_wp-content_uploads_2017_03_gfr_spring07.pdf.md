Why Nuclear Power Is Not
the Answer
Steven Capra, Executive Director of the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, and 
Ben Luce, Ph.D., Chair and Policy Director of the Coalition for Clean and Aﬀ ordable Energy
Excerpted from New Mexico Wild!, Winter 2007, a publication of the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance.
As global warming becomes the hot-
test topic on the environmental radar 
and energy use continues to soar, the 
resurgence of the nuclear power industry 
has taken center stage.  Many say that 
nuclear power is the key to our energy 
future and limiting global warming.  
Nevertheless, before we jump to conclu-
sions, let’s take a closer look at the new 
wave of nuclear power plants so strongly 
advocated by many in Congress, a hand-
ful of conservationists, and much of the 
well-meaning public. Th is will help us to 
better understand the potential impact 
of nuclear power plants on America’s, 
and for that matter, the world’s energy 
future.
The Money Pit
For more than 50 years, the nuclear 
industry has been heavily subsidized by 
your federal tax dollars to a tune of $66 billion for research and development alone.  Yet 
today no construction can occur without massive federal subsidies.  In addition, in 2005 
Congress renewed the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act, which covers all

Uranium Case 
Goes to Federal 
Court
On Feburary 12, the Law Center ﬁ led a 
landmark lawsuit in federal court aimed at 
derailing proposed uranium mining in and 
near the communities of Crownpoint and 
Church Rock.  
Th e lawsuit comes after our clients, the 
Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium 
Mining (ENDAUM)and the Southwest 
Research and Information Center (SRIC) 
lost a decade-long bid to overturn a uranium 
mining license granted to Hydro Resources, 
Inc. (HRI) by the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission (NRC).  
“T ó eii be’iiná át’é – ‘Water is life,’” 
stated Lynnea Smith, Executive Director of 
ENDAUM, when the suit was ﬁ led.  “Th e 
NRC has ignored our communities for more 
than a decade as we have fought to protect 
the resource that is most important to us.  
Have no doubt about it – we will continue 
to ﬁ ght for the purity of our water for gen-
erations to come.” 
Th e petition for review, ﬁ led in the U.S. 
T enth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, 
asks the Court to review numerous decisions

issued by the NRC during the past ten years.  Lead attorney Eric 
Jantz argues that the Agency violated the Atomic Energy Act, the 
National Environmental Policy Act, and its own regulations when 
it issued decisions on numerous issues.  
Outlining details of the case, Jantz explains that the Agency issued 
a license to the mining company despite the fact that the company 
failed to prove that it would
protect groundwater from contamination by uranium and 
other heavy metals — even though the water is the sole 
source of drinking water for nearly 15,000 residents;
ensure that the health of residents near the mines would 
be protected from damaging radiological air emissions, 
despite the fact that the area already exceeds federal radio-
activity standards due to past mining contamination;
post an adequate bond to ensure that the site would be 
cleaned up in the event that the company is unable to 
reclaim the land or water impacted by the mining — al-
though no mine of this type has ever been reclaimed to 
baseline levels.
Jantz continues, “Our clients stand a much better chance of pro-
tecting Navajo communities from unsafe uranium mining in fed-
eral court, which is unburdened by the pro-industry bias exhibited 
by the NRC.”
Th is case should be completely briefed by late summer.  We expect 
a decision from the Court in 2008.
— Staﬀ  Attorney Eric Jantz
Navajo communities win victory in 
front of E.P.A.
On February 6, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
and the U.S. Department of the Interior determined that HRI’s 
Church Rock Section 8 property is Indian Country for the pur-
poses of enforcing the Safe Drinking Water Act.  
Uranium Ban Will Apply
Th is important decision places jurisdiction to enforce the Drink-
ing Water Act with the Federal government or the Navajo Nation.  
Signiﬁ cantly, this determination of Indian Country means that the 
Diné Natural Resources Protection Act applies to this parcel of land 
and uranium mining and processing is therefore prohibited 
under Navajo law.  
Unfortunately this issue is not yet over.  In March, HRI appealed 
the EPA decision to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.  Th e Law 
Center’s clients intend to ﬁ le a friend of the court brief with the 
Court of Appeals urging that the EPA’s determination be upheld.

Law Center prepares for 
Precedent-setting landfill hearing  
With a population of only 6,300 people, the colonia of Chapar-
ral is home to two landﬁ lls, a sewage reclamation plant, a sewage 
sludge disposal site, a sand and gravel operation, a hazardous waste 
container storage facility, an electric power plant and a natural gas 
plant.  Rhino Environmental Services is seeking to build another 
landﬁ ll in Chaparral, less than half a mile from homes.
Public T estimony is ‘Irrelevant’
In September 2001, hundreds of the town’s residents packed 
the middle school auditorium for several nights to participate in 
the public hearing.  Many testiﬁ ed about negative impacts that 
they feared would accompany the dump, including groundwater 
contamination, air pollution and health impacts.  Resident Jim See 
testiﬁ ed to another concern voiced by many residents, “Haven’t we 
done our part?  Why another dump?  I ask this question, is this 
really a case of gouging a large hole [in] Chaparral’s backyard for 
a dump, because the people happen to be poor, hard working and 
unable to ﬁ nancially ﬁ ght such a development?”
T o their shock, the New Mexico Environment Department 
(NMED) Hearing Oﬃ  cer stated during the proceeding that their 
non-technical testimony was “irrelevant” to the Agency’s decision.  
Th e NMED then proceeded to issue the permit to the landﬁ ll 
company.
Community Wins Landmark Decision
Outraged by the State’s open disregard for overwhelming public 
opposition to the landﬁ ll, the Colonias Development Council 
(CDC) appealed the decision, ultimately arguing its case before 
the New Mexico Supreme Court.  With help from Law Center at-
torneys, the CDC emerged with a precedent-setting decision from 
the Supreme Court justices in 2005.  In their decision, the justices 
stated that “Th e [Environment] Department’s review must include 
“Th e NRC has ignored our communities for 
more than a decade as we have fought to 
protect the resource that is most important to 
us.  Have no doubt about it – we will continue 
to ﬁ ght for the purity of our water for genera-
tions to come.”

Public Ignored in Vulcan 
Concrete Plant Case
After over a year of litigating, the appeal of the Vulcan 
concrete plant air permit is over. 
Th e appeal was ﬁ led by Law Center Staﬀ  Attorney Sarah 
Piltch on behalf of the Law Center’s clients, the Moun-
tain View Neighborhood Association, the South Valley 
Coalition of Neighborhood Associations, and several 
individuals.  It was the ﬁ rst appeal ever ﬁ led to the 
Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Air Quality Control 
Board.
Not One Neighbor in Favor
In addition to the technical witnesses presented by our 
clients at hearings in May 2006 and January 2007, 
forty-seven community members spoke out against the 
facility during the public comment periods of the May 
hearing. Not one community member spoke in favor 
of the facility. 
On March 14, 2007 the Board met, deliberated and 
decided to narrowly modify Vulcan’s permit, requiring 
wheel washes on the haul roads into and out of the facil-
ity. Unfortunately, it was far removed from the goal of 
our clients, who had argued for a denial of the permit.  
Th e Board also disregarded our clients’ requests for 
many other conditions to the permit, including reduced 
operating hours and additional monitoring and report-
ing requirements. 
One Bright Spot
One bright spot in this case was our success in reduc-
ing the fee to ﬁ le an appeal with the 
Board.  Originally charged $1,000 
to challenge the permit, the Board 
ultimately refunded the fee when our 
clients showed that it was a ﬁ nancial 
hardship.  Th anks to our eﬀ orts, 
the regulations have been changed, 
and the fee for an appeal has been 
lowered to $150.
Th e Law Center’s clients continue to oppose the con-
struction of the Vulcan concrete batch plant across the 
street from their community center, and are considering 
their future steps and strategies.

consideration of public testimony about the proposed landﬁ ll’s adverse 
impact on a community’s quality of life.”  Th is is the ﬁ rst decision in New 
Mexico aﬃ  rming that quality of life must be taken into account when the 
Environment Department considers the issuance of a permit.
In addition, the Court ordered that the Environment 
Department reopen the public testimony portion of 
the hearing.  Law Center Director Douglas Meiklejohn 
is representing the CDC as it prepares for the hearing 
this summer.  Th is hearing is particularly important 
because it is the ﬁ rst test of the Environment Depart-
ment under the Supreme Court’s new interpretation of 
the NM Solid Waste Act.  We will be ﬁ ghting hard to 
ensure that the State seriously considers public testimony 
before reissuing its decision on the Rhino permit, since its process will not 
only aﬀ ect the residents of Chaparral, but also all solid waste permitting 
decisions in the State for years to come.

non-military nuclear facilities constructed in the United States before 2026.  Th e Act establishes a no 
fault insurance-type system in which the ﬁ rst $10 billion is industry-funded, should an accident occur, 
but any claims above that ﬁ gure would be paid by the federal government.  Sandia Laboratory calcu-
lated in 2004 that the cost of a serious nuclear plant accident would likely run $600 billion or more.
In the 2005 Energy Bill, according to the non-proﬁ t group Public Citizen, the nuclear industry 
was the clear winner, raking in more than $12 billion in subsidies.  Th is includes tax credits for each 
kilowatt-hour of nuclear generated energy produced from new reactors during the ﬁ rst eight years of 
operation. It is project that this will cost the US T reasury more than $5.7 billion in lost revenue.  Th e 
bill also authorized a $2 billion “risk insurance” to pay industry for any delays in construction of new 
power plants.  T o compare, the oil and gas industry received about $6 billion in subsidies, while the 
coal industry got $9 billion.  However, it is clear that it isn’t solely building nuclear plants that required 
subsidies, but also keeping them in operation.  
Mining, refining and the realities of global warming
Many have argued that nuclear power is the key to stopping global warming because nuclear power 
does not generate carbon dioxide and it slows the consumption of fossil fuels.  Nevertheless, there are 
some serious problems with this hypothesis.  First, the cost of nuclear power is simply not viable or 
sustainable.
Second, any major expansion of nuclear power would require a complementary development of ura-
nium mining.  Th is would quickly deplete the supply of high-grade ores, in turn causing tremendous 
pressure to mine uranium wherever it could be found.  Th is could lead to potentially disastrous envi-
ronmental impacts from in-situ leach mining (aka pumping chemical solutions into the ground to force 
out uranium-rich solutions).  Th is type of mining presents a major threat to various aquifers, including 
those in New Mexico.  With uranium prices eclipsing $62.50 a pound [editor’s note -- since this article 
originally went to press in December, 2006, the price of uranuim has risen to $113 per pound], people 
are pushing for access to lands across the West. Companies seeing a modern day uranium rush are 
staking claims to the boundaries of the Navajo Nation, which Mark Pelizza, vice president of Uranium 
Resources, Inc. (URI), calls the “Saudi Arabia of Uranium.”   URI could start mining in Church Rock
 
in 2008; if they convince regulators that the work is environmentally sound, they could also begin min-
ing in Crownpoint.
Th e Navajo Nation is saying “no” to such eﬀ orts.  T wo years ago it passed a ban on mining or 
processing uranium in “Navajo Indian Country,” a term designed to safeguard the reservation and 
neighboring communities.  But despite the ban, the uranium companies continue to push for access, 
forcing tribal President Joe Shirley, Jr. to sign an executive order that instructed all tribal employees to 
“avoid any communication with uranium company employees.”  However, the Navajo Nation remains 
poor and the uranium companies are banking on that to shift perception their way in order to gain 
access.  Th ey continue to push their agenda with lobbying eﬀ orts in Washington to increase accessibil-
ity while keeping uranium prices sky-high.  From the Navajo perspective, no mining can occur when 
there remain more than 1,000 unreclaimed uranium mines and no funds to clean them up. Th e Navajo 
continue to ﬁ ght:  protesting, educating their people, and going to Washington.
In terms of global warming, it is true that nuclear power is a cleaner source of energy than coal ﬁ red 
plants or even natural gas, because nukes don’t produce carbon dioxide (if you ignore the mining.)  But 
to have a tangible impact on global warming would require a major construction undertaking.  In order 
to displace fossil fuels worldwide, we would need to construct 10,000-30,000 new nuclear power 
plants to produce the needed 12.8 trillion watts of world energy.  Remember, today there are slightly

more than 400 existing plants.  While many can argue that it’s a positive step to get more nuclear power 
online to reduce greenhouse gases, if we refocus our energy priorities, we can obtain the same results by 
conserving and using alternative energy sources.
Disposal
Let’s take a look at that messy problem of disposing of radioactive waste produced by nuclear power 
plants. According to a recent article in National Geographic, currently in the US there are more than 
52,000 tons of spent radioactive fuel from our nation’s commercial and defense nuclear reactors.  Th ere 
are also more than 91 million gallons of high-level waste left over from plutonium processing, scores of 
tons of plutonium, more than half a million tons of depleted uranium, and millions of cubic feet of con-
taminated tools, metal scraps, clothing, oils, solvents and other wastes.  In addition, there are more than 
265 million tons of tailings from milling uranium ore.  Th e government’s solution is to transport some of 
the low-level waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) facility just east of Carlsbad.  But the more 
ambitious proposal is to build a repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.
Yucca Mountain is located only 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas.  It is the only US site currently 
proposed to store more than 77,000 tons of high-level radioactive waste from US weapons sites and com-
mercial nuclear reactors.  Th e nuclear industry has thus far succeeded, thanks to a very aggressive lob-
bying eﬀ ort, to overturn Nevada’s veto of the Yucca Mountain proposal in 2002.  Yet to date, numerous 
scientiﬁ c, economic and policy problems continue to plague the Yucca Mountain project.  Th e proposed 
dump faces an uncertain future in upcoming regulatory, legislative and legal processes.  Meanwhile, the 
waste pile continues to grow at existing nuclear power plants and the security of those plants remains 
questionable.
The future 
Starting with Congress, it is essential that we begin to seriously fund clean alternative energy sources.  We 
do not need nuclear power to ﬁ ght global warming, nor do we need it to supply our growing energy 
demands.  We have vast renewable energy sources, especially wind and solar energy, which dwarf the 
potential of nuclear power.  Energy eﬃ  ciency is also the key to our energy future.  However, it begins 
with an Apollo-like investment in alternative energy.  Let’s put $12 billion or so into solar research and 
development every year for the next ten years.  Let’s also put serious money into energy eﬃ  ciency and 
designing automobiles that get 200-300 miles per gallon.
Renewable energy is now growing without serious government support at a rate of 30-40% per year 
in virtually all sectors.  Th ese energy sources are developing without the threat of terrorists, contamina-
tion, waste disposal issues and are also helping to make communities more self-suﬃ  cient.  Th ey are also 
creating long-term employment for people across the country.  Will alternatives be enough to stop global 
warming?  Th e jury is still out.  But it will clearly be alternative energy sources that make America cleaner 
and less dependent on Middle-East oil and politics, while creating energy that does not threaten global 
stability.  Much like electric cars, there are special interests that do not want power generation that is not 
centralized and full of government subsidies.
Once again, it’s time to infuse some sanity into the energy debate.  Perhaps with this Congress we can 
turn a page…one that for the ﬁ rst time makes energy development and production compatible with clean 
air, water and stronger communities.

2007 Legislative Session 
Produces Mixed Results
Th is year’s legislative session had the usual mix of the good, the bad 
and the ugly.  Th e Law Center’s eﬀ  orts in the session were aided con-
siderably by the volunteer work done by Don Goldman, who reviewed 
bills as they were introduced and brought to our attention those that 
could impact communities or the environment.  We are grateful to Don 
for his assistance.
Protective Legislation
First, the Law Center and its legislative partners, the Oil and Gas 
Accountability Project and the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Asso-
ciation, were able to pass the 
New Mexico Surface Owner Protection 
Act (SOPA), sponsored by Sen. Phil Griego.  While the Bill that 
was eventually signed into law by Governor Richardson was a com-
promise between the surface owner advocates and the oil and gas 
industry, the SOPA goes a long way to protect surface owners from 
environmental and property damage done by oil and gas operations 
on their land.  In fact, the New Mexico SOPA is the strongest sur-
face owner protection act in the country.   
Second, the Law Center, the Environmental Justice Working Group 
of the Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice, 
and other environmental justice advocacy organizations worked for 
passage of the 
New Mexico Environmental Health Act.   Th is bill, 
which was sponsored by Sen. Linda Lopez and Rep. Miguel Garcia, 
would have required that the State Environment Department take 
into account the impacts of its decisions on communities, some-
thing that the Department currently does not do except in limited 
circumstances.  
Th e bill was quickly killed in the Senate by the industry-friendly 
Conservation Committee.  After it became apparent that House Bill 
888 would fail as well, the Law Center and the E.J. Working Group 
drafted House Memorial 97, which passed.  Th e Memorial calls 
for the State Environment Department to determine how it can 
take into account the impacts of its decisions on communities.  It 
is not yet clear what process the Department will use to make this 
determination, but we at the Law Center and the Environmental 
Justice Working Group intend to be involved in the Department’s 
consideration of the issue. 
 
Harmful Legislation
Fortunately the Law Center and its allies were able to stop a particu-
larly noxious memorial introduced by freshman senator David Uli-
barri.  Th e 
Nuclear Energy and Uranium Resources Joint Memorial 
sought to welcome the uranium mining industry into New Mexico.  
Further, the Memorial directed the State to “remove all regulatory 
barriers” to uranium mining in New Mexico.  We are happy to re-
port that the Law Center and a coalition of native, environmental 
and clean energy groups were able to kill the memorial before it 
reached the Senate ﬂ oor.  However, as uranium prices keep climbing, 
similar measures undoubtedly will be introduced in future sessions.
Another principal piece of negative legislation that was considered 
during the session was House Bill 685, the 
Administrative Account-
ability Act.  Sponsored by Rep. Daniel Silva and backed by the New 
Mexico Mining Association, the Association of Commerce and In-
dustry, and others, the Bill would have curtailed the ability of State 
regulatory agencies to provide meaningful protection for commu-
nities and the environment.  Among its other provisions, the Bill as 
originally introduced would have 
• prevented state agencies from conducting unannounced in-
spections of regulated facilities; 
• required agencies to make public the names of whistle blowers; 
• prohibited agencies from putting conditions into permits 
unless they were speciﬁ cally authorized by statute; and 
• required agencies to pay ﬁ  nes if they failed to comply with 
the Bill’s requirements.
Although we and our allies got the Bill killed in committee, industry 
groups were able to persuade the Legislature to pass two memorials.  
Th ese memorials, which were identical as introduced by Sen. Ben 
Altamirano and Rep. Al Park, call for the establishment of a task 
force to review and make recommendations concerning procedures 
used by state administrative agencies.  Before the Senate Memorial 
was passed, however, it was amended by Sen. Linda Lopez to in-
clude, among others, two representatives of environmental justice 
communities.  
It is not clear how the diﬀ  erences between the two memorials will 
be resolved or whether there will be two task forces.  Each memo-
rial calls for the task force it establishes to report to the appropri-
ate interim legislative committee in the fall of this year.  Find out 
more about the makeup of these committees on our website at www.

Please join us in welcoming our new staff members
Sebia Hawkins, Development Director
Sebia brings to the Law Center a twenty-ﬁ ve year track record in fundraising, networking, com-
munications, and advocacy for disenfranchised communities.  She moved to Santa Fe in 1996 from 
Washington D.C., where she served for nine years as Greenpeace International’s Paciﬁ c Campaign 
Co-Coordinator, where the environmental and public health impacts of nuclear weapons production 
and chemical weapons destruction were central to her work.  Global warming has also topped her list 
of priorities for the past twenty years, with a strong focus on how climate clange impacts the environ-
ment, societies and economies in the Paciﬁ c Islands region.  Sebia also participated in Greenpeace 
US’s internal organizational work on diversity and environmental justice issues in the early 1990s, and 
then worked for the Federated States of Micronesia between 1999-2003.  “Coral reef destruction, the 
loss of ﬁ sheries and the loss of fresh water resources are creating the world’s ﬁ rst climate refugees in the 
Paciﬁ c,” she says, “but global warming is going to aﬀ ect everyone on the planet, starting with the least 
powerful communities in fragile environments – just like we have in New Mexico.”
Th rough her environmental justice work, Sebia came to know many of New Mexico’s environ-
mental justice leaders and issues of concern in northern New Mexico.  For the past ten years, she has 
worked as a consultant, board member and volunteer for numerous New Mexico non-proﬁ t organiza-
tions that focus on the environment, environmental justice, and sustainable community issues.  She 
looks forward to beoming well-acquainted with the Law Center’s members, and is already working diligently to build the organization’s 
fundraising and communications capacity.
Juana Colón, Oﬃ  ce Manager
Juana moved to Santa Fe from Brooklyn, NY where she lived for 10 years. She moved to 
Brooklyn from Buﬀ alo, NY in the hopes of putting her degree in Art History to use, but 
over time became disenchanted with the Big City. After completing her masters degree in 
archaeology in 2005, Juana wanted to ﬁ nd a community that was interested in serving the 
indigenous cultural landscape as well as preserving the ecological one. If you ask her why 
she came to New Mexico, she’ll say “I needed more sky in my life.”
At the Law Center, Juana has found a place to contribute her many talents along with 
feeding her passion for the protection of the environment and encouraging sustainable 
living. Her hobbies include weaving, baking, enjoying the outdoors with friends and try-
ing to ﬁ nd new uses for old things. She believes she has found a home in Santa Fe and at 
the Law Center. 
Did you know that you can donate stocks, 
bonds and securities to the Law Center?    
Th e Law Center welcomes gifts of publicly traded stocks, cash, bonds and mutual funds.  In fact, securities which have an unreal ized long 
term capital gain (held longer than one year) are often a more eﬀ ective gift than cash!  Because the Law Center is a tax-exempt organization, 
it does not pay capital gains taxes on appreciated stock gifts, meaning New Mexico’s environment gets the most out of your gift!
In order for the Law Center to acknowledge your gift and for audit purposes, please provide the Law Center with the following informa-
tion:   Donor’s name and address, the name and number of securities transferred, and your broker’s contact information.  Once we have this 
information, we will send you the name and contact information for our broker, and the account routing number necessary for the transfer.

Farewells
Goodbye to Staﬀ  Attorney Roderick Ventura
Th e Law Center announces the departure of Rod Ventura, who served as our Senior 
Staﬀ  Attorney for four years. 
Rod was an important 
member of our legal team, 
with an impressive list of 
achievemnets.  Among some 
of his accomplishments for 
communities in New Mexico 
were his work on the legal 
team that negotiated for the 
return of aboriginal lands to 
Picuris Pueblo, his successful 
negotiation for a stringent 
air quality permit for the 
Helena chemical plant in 
Mesquite, and his key role 
in the adoption of environ-
mentally-strong permits for the 
Phelps Dodge copper mines in Grant County and Molycorp mine near Questa.  We 
will certainly miss him, and wish him the best in his new endeavors at the New Mexico 
Department of Public Education.
Law Center Bids Adieu to Board Members Hurley and deBuys
Th e Law Center also bids farewells to board members Joanna Hurley and William (Bill) 
deBuys.  Joanna, who is the owner of HurleyMedia in Santa Fe, did a wonderful job 
helping the Law Center with our public relations since coming on our board in 2002.  
She has also served with distinction on our development committee.  Bill joined our 
board in 2005.  He oﬀ ered us the beneﬁ t of his broad knowledge of non-proﬁ t manage-
ment, as well as his deep wisdom and thoughtful eloquence about the environment in 
which we live.  We sincerely thank Joanna and Bill for their service to the Law Center, 
and to the environment and communities of New Mexico.
In Memoriam – Wilfred Rael
Th e Law Center is profoundly sorry to report the death of Wilfred Rael of Questa, a 
long time advocate for protection of New Mexico’s water resources generally and acequia 
systems in particular.  Wilfred was a gentle man who worked for years to restore the Red 
River, which was polluted by the Molycorp mine in Questa, and who advocated tirelessly 
for the protection of New Mexico’s acequia systems.  
Wilfred’s work for New Mexico’s ground and surface water was the basis for the Law Cen-
ter’s 1992 award to him of the ﬁ rst Karl Souder Award for protection of New Mexico’s 
water resources.  In his speech accepting that Award, Wilfred said:  “Our enemy is the 
product of greed, and it thrives on poverty, apathy, ignorance, and a lack of education.”  
Wilfred understood the forces that he was working against, and he was willing to name 
them.  We will all miss him as we work to continue his legacy.

To:  Eastern Navajo Dine Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM)
Subject: Your march April 24, 2007
Our hearts are with you this morning as you demonstrate your concerns about uranium 
mining in your communities.  We would be with you in person if we could.  Today we 
are also ﬁ ghting our common enemy, Uranium Resources, Inc. (which wholly owns Hydro 
Resources, Inc.), at the Texas state capitol in Austin.
We have been both seduced and deceived by URI’s lies about the safety 
of its mining operation, and its false promises of restoration.  
When our people signed the uranium leases, they were told that the min-
ing would leave the water cleaner than it had ever been.  The state 
has told us many times that it would protect our air, our land, and our 
groundwater.
In truth, our groundwater has been contaminated by uranium mining with 
no hope of ever being restored.  Our land has been contaminated and we 
see no future where we will ever be able to farm it again.  Our air is 
contaminated with radon and its poisons.  Our people daily live with 
fear.  
In the past two months there have been two explosions at the URI plant 
near Kingsville.  URI has denied the truth about those explosions to 
state and federal inspectors.  Many spills of thousands of gallons of 
contaminated liquids are recorded in state ﬁ les.  URI continues to re-
fuse to honor its promise to restore previously mined ﬁ elds.
We see the hunger for proﬁ t at the expense of the earth and its gifts.  We see the 
disregard for human and animal lives.  We see the corruption of elected ofﬁ cials and 
state employees.
On this day when you, our neighbors in New Mexico, stand against the evils of uranium 
mining, we stand with you.  We are proud to be called your friends and allies.
Signed: Members of South Texas Opposes Pollution (STOP)
Our Navajo clients met with soli-
darity from residents in T exas, who 
are ﬁ ghting an existing in situ leach 
uranium mine operated by HRI’s 
parent company, Uranium Resources, 
Inc. in Kingsville, TX.  Above, At-
torney Eric Jantz in front of the 
HRI’s Crownpoint plant.
