Proposed Crownpoint Uranium Mine
INITIATION DATE: September 1996
CLIENTS/PARTNERS: Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM) and the Southwest Research and Information Center (SRIC)
OPPOSING PARTIES: Hydro Resources Inc.
STATUS: Ongoing
ATTORNEYS: Eric Jantz
SUMMARY:
Two decades ago, Crownpoint resident Mitchell Capitan worked as a groundwater technician for the MobilOil pilot-scale in-situ leach (ISL) uranium mine near his home. He saw first-hand, month after month, that MobilOil could not clean up the water that it polluted with the process.
When he learned that Hydro Resources, Inc. sought to open a new ISL mine near his home, he organized his neighbors into the Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM – see videos below from two ENDAUM members). Two years later, in 1996, they approached the New Mexico Environmental Law Center for legal assistance. We have represented ENDAUM ever since.
It’s been an historic case, with work at the local, state, national and international levels. The stakes are high: the Westwater Canyon Aquifer currently supplies approximately 15,000 residents of the Eastern Agency of the Navajo Nation. In addition, the tribal water planners declared that the aquifer will be an important future source of water to meet growing demands in the future. The mines and processing plant would also add radioactive air emissions to an airshed that already exceeds federal air quality standards for radiation.
“If these mines succeed in opening, it will send a chilling message to communities near uranium ore: uranium is worth more than your water … more than your air … more than you and your neighbors.”
