Minnesota childcare payments have oversight flaws, according to federal audit
WASHINGTON (TNND) — A federal audit in Minnesota showed that there are flaws in the childcare assistance program when it comes to monitoring attendance of children.
The audit was published in May, but has resurfaced in the news following YouTuber Nick Shirley’s video which exposed alleged Minnesota daycare fraud.
He visited multiple daycare centers and alleged that millions of taxpayer dollars were funding centers that appeared vacant.
The audit showed that the state of Minnesota didn’t comply with federal and state attendance documentation requirements for some payments under the Child Care Assistance Program, according to Fox9.
The Child Care Assistance Program is funded by taxpayers.
Data from 2023 shows that out of 200 assistance payments, attendance-related problems were found in 38.
Roughly 11% of all the payments at some issue, according to the federal government.
The federal government has taken action following Shirley’s reporting from Minnesota.
Small Business Administration head Kelly Loeffler announced Thursday that the administration suspended thousands of borrowers from Minnesota due to alleged fraudulent activity.
“Today, our agency took action to suspend 6,900 Minnesota borrowers amid suspected fraudulent activity,” she wrote on X. “In total, these borrowers were approved for 7,900 PPP and EIDL loans worth approximately $400M.”
