Trump uses veto power to clap back at Indigenous tribe for Alligator Alcatraz lawsuit
OCHOPEE, Fla. (CBS12) — President Trump used his veto power to "clap back" at a South Florida Indigenous tribe as the legal battles surrounding Alligator Alcatraz remain in limbo.
Alligator Alcatraz is the detention center deep in Florida’s Everglades.
The Miccosukee Tribe, whose reservation is the facility’s closest neighbor, is suing state and federal officials.
President Trump, with his pen, has just thrown a bucket of cold water on a bill that would have expanded tribal land and given the Miccosukees’ flood protection for one of their small villages-- from the Department of the Interior.
In his veto notice, Trump writes:
despite seeking funding and special treatment from the federal government, the Miccosukee tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected."
For its part, the tribe says it is just trying to protect sacred land and the delicate ecosystem of the Everglades.
Congress can override the veto: That would take a two-thirds majority in the House and the Senate, but it's unclear if there’s any hope for that.
If Capitol Hill fights the President on this issue, it could create tension inside the Republican party heading into a midterm election year, but the bill passed with bipartisan support before landing on the President’s desk.
The Miccosukee Tribe has partnered with environmental groups and several prominent Florida democrats to sue the agencies running Alligator Alcatraz.
The camp was built to hold thousands of illegal immigrants, but according to reports, typically there’s less than a thousand detainees at the facility.
