New Mexico Environmental Law Center’s Statement in  
Solidarity with Protestors 
 
The events of the last weeks – which have their origins in the very beginning of our nation’s history 
– have laid bare the inequities that are the mainstay of America.  The state sponsored violence is 
vicious and jarring and  has resulted in widespread popular resistance.  The New Mexico 
Environmental Law Center unequivocally condemns police violence and sta nds in solidarity with 
the communities impacted by police violence and the Black Lives Matter movement.   
 
The massive protest against police violence and systemic racism also provides a glimpse into the 
more mundane, but equally caustic, day to day violence that existing racist structures perpetuate.  
The daily machinery of oppression includes the wide array of environmental and public health 
laws that mediate how each of us relates to the larger global ecosystem.   
 
While our nation’s environmental laws are held up as a bastion of progressivism, they do not serve 
everyone equally.  The environmental movement is rooted in the privilege of affluence and 
whiteness that has historically excluded communities of color.   
 
We in the environmental movement are often the beneficiaries of the privileges that at the same 
time oppress our neighbors and allies.  It would be easy for the Law Center to retweet a statement 
from a frontline organization or post somethi ng on our website expressing outrage at the latest 
incidents of state violence and then go about our lives.  It’s much more difficult and important to 
engage in meaningful and thoughtful evaluation of our place in the framework that perpetuates 
violence and oppression.    
 
We believe, however, that only with a hard look at ourselves and the system we work in can we 
begin to really understand and resist the systemic racist structures that dictate who has clean 
water, air and land and who must pay the price for industrial “progress” that ostensibly benefits us 
all, but in reality only serves a few. At the Law Center, we acknowledge that we have benefited 
from the status quo and have  begun the difficult and essential process necessary to become a 
more equitable and inclusive organization.  We are having conversations both internally and with 
community partners to identify ways in which we may have perpetuated oppressive structures 
and find ways to address our shortcomings to become better partners with communities.   
 
We also call on our  white friends and colleagues to reject the easy tropes that “environmental 
laws protect everyone” or “governments are well meaning” and to truly examine our system of 
environmental law and policy and ask whether it also contributes to the day to day violence that 
communities of color live with.  We call on our friends and colleagues to consider that 
environmentalism is more than protecting a scenic area for recreation or aesthetic beauty, but is 
also a fundamental struggle to ensure human and civil rights to the basic conditions necessary for 
survival and human dignity.  We call on our  white friends and colleagues to listen deeply to 
communities of color; to step up when called to, to step back when asked and to stand in 
solidarity no matter what.
