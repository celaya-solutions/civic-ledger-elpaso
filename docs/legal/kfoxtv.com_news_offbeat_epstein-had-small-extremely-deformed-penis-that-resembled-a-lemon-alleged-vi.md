Epstein had small, 'extremely deformed' penis that resembled a lemon, alleged victim says
WASHINGTON (TNND) — Convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein a had a small, "extremely deformed" penis that looked like a lemon, one of his alleged victims reportedly said.
Rina Oh, 46, allegedly made the claim during a recent Substack interview with Tina Brown.
He had an extremely deformed penis,” Oh said, according to Brown.
Some people have described it as the shape of an egg," Oh added. per Brown. "I think it was more of the shape of a lemon, and it was really small when it was fully erect. It was probably like two inches.”
Oh has claimed she is among the women and girls Epstein -- along with his and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, victimized. She said Epstein and Maxwell "groomed her as early as 2000," according to The New York Post.
The media outlet also said Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, was asked about "the odd shape of his manhood" during a civil lawsuit deposition in 2009 after several underage girls came forward, saying they had been groomed and sexually abused by him.
In a separate Substack interview with Vicky Ward, Oh said she is grateful the House and Senate approved a bill that requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to release all files and communications related to Epstein, as well as any information about the investigation into his death in a federal prison in 2019, within 30 days.
The bill allows for redactions about Epstein’s victims for ongoing federal investigations, but DOJ cannot withhold information due to “embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.”
Trump signed the legislation on Wednesday night, announcing that the DOJ has already turned over nearly 50,000 pages of documents to Congress.
Do not forget -- The Biden Administration did not turn over a SINGLE file or page related to Democrat Epstein, nor did they ever even speak about him," Trump wrote on Truth Social.
In his post, Trump said Epstein, was "a lifelong Democrat" who donated thousands of dollars to Democrat politicians. He alleged that Epstein "was deeply associated" with former President Bill Clinton and Larry Summers, who on Wednesday resigned from his position at Harvard University.
Trump also accused "sleazebag" political activist Reid Hoffman, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (who asked Epstein to donate to his Campaign AFTER Epstein was charged), Democrat Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett, and many more.
Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES! As everyone knows, I asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, to pass this Bill in the House and Senate, respectively. Because of this request, the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage," he wrote.
