BECOME AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BUSINESS PARTNER!
Our Green Business Partners Program is now our Environmental Justice Business Partners Program!
Environmental Justice (EJ) Business Partners are supporters of the New Mexico Environmental Law Center (NMELC), who are deeply committed to protecting New Mexico’s air, land, and water and placing frontline communities at the center of the conversation.
At NMELC, we center environmental justice throughout our work—the principle that all people, regardless of socioeconomic status, race or ethnicity, have the fundamental right to live in a clean and healthy environment. Our EJ Business Partners are critical to ensuring that the important environmental justice work at NMELC continues strong.
In recognition of the generous financial support, EJ Business Partners are included in various NMELC communications including our social media platforms and in newsletters reaching over 2,000 people every week. We invite you to highlight your business commitment to New Mexico’s environment and communities through an annual gift at a level that aligns with your business. Past EJ Business Partners have contributed at $500 to over $5,000.
In-kind donations are also accepted and appreciated. Past in-kind donors have given specific services and goods equal to the amounts listed above for recognition.
EJ Business Partners strengthen and support NMELC’s ability to take on precedent-setting cases that protect our communities from environmental hazards and pollution. NMELC proudly offers free to low-cost legal services to clients and communities who are defending our environment and are upholding environmental justice. It is our privilege to represent and work alongside the many clients and communities we serve.

- Recognition in the Annual Impact Report, delivered by mail, email, and available on our website
