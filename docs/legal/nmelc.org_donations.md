Why Give to NMELC?
NMELC provides free and low-cost legal services to people fighting for clean air, land, and water in their communities. We are the only movement law center in the state focused on environmental justice. Our client-directed work prioritizes environmental issues that disproportionately impact Indigenous, Black, Latinx, rural, and low-income communities. Together with our clients we advocate for equitable and just environmental policies that protect the wellbeing of all New Mexicans.
Our cases often take years and even decades to resolve. Please consider making a monthly donation, if you can, to help sustain this essential work. (Enter your donation amount in the form to the left and select: “Show my support by making this a recurring donation.”)
If you are making a donation as an Environmental Justice Business Partner, make a note in the comment section (or in the memo line of a mailed check) that indicates your donation is for the EJ Business Partner Program.
Reach out at nmelc@nmelc.org to ask about other ways to support our nonprofit, including donating stock, planned giving, or volunteering.
