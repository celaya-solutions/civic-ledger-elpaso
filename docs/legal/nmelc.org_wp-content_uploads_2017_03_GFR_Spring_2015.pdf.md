SPRING 2015
Fracking Pipeline Pulled 
The proposed pipeline would have passed near the church at Abó, one of the
Spanish-era ruins at Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument; Puebloan 
sites along the route stretch back thousands of years.
With the Law Center, an energized community has an attorney in its fight          
against gas giant, Kinder Morgan.
For nearly a year, the Law Center Staff Attorney Jon Block represented 
Resistiendo, a Mountainair-based grassroots group, in its effort to prevent 
the construction of a pipeline through central New Mexico. The pipeline 
would have carried carbon dioxide from Arizona to West Texas for 
fracking, and was slated to cross public and private lands near the 
historic Salinas Pueblo Missions. Kinder Morgan, a transnational energy 
infrastructure company, pulled the plug on the project in January, citing 
the soft oil and gas market. However, we agree with our clients that 
aggressive advocacy against the project helped bring about its demise.

Case Updates Development News
Would theAquiferScience water grab have been stopped without you?
Without tenacious neighbors and their stalwart public-interest
counsel, would the State Engineer have turned down Aquifer
Science LLC’s speculative water application for the East
Mountains? Unlikely! 
Law Center members made it possible for Staff Attorney 
Bruce Frederick and pro bonoco-counsel Paul Hultin to spend
months on the highly technical hearing. Our team argued 
that the Sandia Basin has been fully appropriated for decades,
and has no more water to spare for new developments.
Agreeing with our argument (and disagreeing with his staff),
State Engineer Scott Verhines denied the application for 
717 acre-feet/year in November 2014 on the grounds that 
the Basin has been fully appropriated. 
Aquifer Science LLC, (a part of the Vidler Water Company, 
which specializes in the privatization of Western water resources) has appealed the decision to state district court;
with your support we will continue our challenge of this ill-advised project in state court later this year.
East Mountains Water Grab Denied
Italian Water Grab Enters Phase III
As a billionaire, Italian Bruno Modena doesn’t have to worry about legal fees
in his bid to disregard the Anti-Speculation doctrine that has been part of
New Mexico water law for over 100 years. Fortunately the people of Datil,
don’t either – but for a very different reason. Since 2008, the Law Center’s
donors have made sure that we could provide free legal representation to
residents of the Augustin Plains in their effort to prevent the state’s most
contested water grab. 
Despite victories over two speculative water applications, our fight is not 
yet over. In December, newly appointed State Engineer T om Blaine dismissed
the second flawed application submitted by Modena’s Augustin Plains Ranch,
LLC just months after it was submitted.
The Ranch has now turned in a third application which contains the same
major flaws as the first two: mainly, it names no particular place or purpose or
beneficial use for the 54,000 acre-feet it intends to appropriate. The Law
Center, with your support, will continue to fight this project. We’ll keep
you informed as to what happens next.
With its applications knocked down twice,
Augustin Plains Ranch tries again under 
a new State Engineer.
Goldman legacy gift
It is always difficult
to say the last good-
bye to dear friends,
and we had to do so
several times in 2014.
With the passing of
Don and Lorraine
Goldman within six
months of each other
last year, it was 
especially hard. Their
memory lives on
with us in their many
of years of friendship
and support.
Don and Lorraine
were extremely 
generous with their
time, energy, ideas,
and humor, and
even in passing have been very generous to the Law Center
and many other organizations by leaving a significant
bequest. We thank them again for their vision, which will
continue to help sustain our work on behalf of New Mexico’s
natural resources and communities.
If you are interested in letting your story live on
through a bequest to the New Mexico Environmental
Law Center, please contact us.
If the Law Center is
already included in your will, trust or other estate plans,
thank you! Please let us know about your plans. We’d like
to be able to give you our heartfelt thanks while we can,
and make sure we understand the intentions of your life-
time gift. Call or email Elizabeth Lee in the Development
Office and she will add your name to the Legacy Society. 
(Of course, you may remain anonymous, if you prefer.)

will be heard. 
ThankYo u!
Thanks again to each and every one of our donors who
contributed to the Law Center between November 1 and
December 31 – your contribution was integral to us
obtaining a $35,000 challenge grant from the EMA
Foundation, which required a 100% match from our 
members. With these funds we’ll continue fighting for
clean air, clean water, and healthy communities for 
New Mexico in 2015!

Churchrock resident and NMELC client Larry J. King
For decades, Law Center supporters have
made it possible for our attorneys to represent
Navajo residents in their fight against unsafe uranium
mining slated for their communities. This mining
includes in situ leach (ISL) mining, which would
mobilize uranium and other heavy metals into aquifers
– including an aquifer that the Navajo Nation has
identified as a “likely future source”of drinking water.
For the first time, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) is weighing regulations that would
help to protect groundwater in New Mexico and
throughout the nation from toxic ISL mining 
contamination. But the regulations don’t go far
enough. That’s why Staff Attorney Eric Jantz, who’s
been working on uranium mining casework since
1998, is joining the Natural Resources Defense
Council, the Powder River Basin Resource Council
and others to comment on the rules. We’ll publish
Eric’s comments later this spring.
Law Center bids farewell to 
Attorney Bruce Frederick
For more than seven years, Bruce did amazing work at the
helm of the Law Center’s water casework, serving as lead
counsel on the Augustin Plains Ranch and Aquifer Science
water grabs; the Copper Rule and our work on the Freeport
McMoRan copper mines; New Mexico’s short-lived green-
house gas regulations; and the Santa Fe County oil and gas
ordinance, to name a few. As of February, Bruce is working
for Santa Fe County…we wish him well in his new endeavors!
