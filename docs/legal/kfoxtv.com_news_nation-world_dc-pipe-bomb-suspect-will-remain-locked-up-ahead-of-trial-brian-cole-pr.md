DC Pipe Bomb suspect will remain locked up ahead of trial
WASHINGTON (7News) — The man accused of planting bombs outside the Republican and Democratic National Committee headquarters in D.C. will remain behind bars as he awaits trial, according to a judge's ruling Friday.
This ruling comes after Brian Cole appeared before a federal judge on Tuesday for a detention hearing. Cole is accused of planting the bombs on the eve of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.

Attorneys for the 30-year-old requested that he go under house arrest at his grandmother's house in Gainesville, saying he poses no danger to the public and an ankle monitor will give the Court reasonable assurance he won't flee.
Prosecutors argued that Cole is a danger to the community, pointing to the bomb-making materials they said he bought as recently as three years ago, that he hid at home and the hundreds of times they said that he wiped his cell phone clean.
The judge ultimately sided with the prosecution.
"The court is keenly aware that pretrial detention must be 'the carefully limited exception' due in no small part to the fact that Mr. Cole, like all defendants, is entitled to the presumption of innocence at this juncture. And the Court understands its 'grave constitutional obligation to ensure that the facts and circumstances of each case warrant this exceptional treatment.' But based on the Court's careful consideration of the relevant factors that govern its determination, this case fits that bill," the ruling from Judge Matthew Sharbaugh reads.
Read the full ruling below:
A recent court filing from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia states Cole confessed two hours into his interview with the FBI after investigators showed him a still image of the suspect from surveillance video close in time to the planting of the bombs.
According to prosecutors' filing, Cole denied to investigators that his actions were directed toward Congress or related to the proceedings scheduled to take place on Jan. 6, when the 2020 presidential election results were supposed to be certified but were ultimately delayed by rioters who broke into the U.S. Capitol Building, alleging the election was rigged. The bombs never went off and were discovered the following afternoon.
Cole told investigators that "something just snapped" after “watching everything, just everything getting worse," states the court filing, amid questions raised by President Donald Trump and Republicans about the results of the 2020 presidential election. There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election.
Cole's charges include transporting an explosive device in interstate commerce with the intent to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or unlawfully to damage or destroy any building, vehicle, or other real or personal property. He is also charged with attempted malicious destruction by means of fire and explosive materials.
