NMELC's Legislative Priorities for 2023
As many of you are well aware, the 2023
Legislative Session is already underway.
During this 60-day session we are focusing
our efforts on three bills that we have
supported in previous years: A "Bad Actor"
bill that would enable state regulators to deny
or suspend a permit for environmental
violations; Private Right of Action that
would allow for citizen suits for environmental
violations; and the Green Amendment (GA),
a proposed Constitutional Amendment which
would allow the right to a clean and healthy
environment to be put to New Mexico voters.
The GA is Senate Joint Resolution SJR 6 and
HJR 4 in the House. More details on these
three important bills are below.
 
The three bills, if passed, would serve as
important tools to strengthen our ability
to protect our air, water and land as well
as community health.
(1) “Bad Actor” (sponsored by  Rep. Christine Chandler and Rep. Andrea Romero)
This bill would amend the Oil and Gas Act to grant the Oil Conservation Division the authority
to deny, suspend, or revoke a permit of any entity 
-who has a record of violation of state or federal environmental laws;
-who fails to prove fiscal solvency;
-who fails to provide proof of third-party environmental insurance.
 
(2) “Private Right of Action” (sponsored by Rep. Matt McQueen)
This bill would amend the Oil and Gas Act, Air Quality Control Act, Water Quality Act,
Solid Waste Act, and Hazardous Waste Act to
-allow for any person who is injured or imminently threatened with injury ("economically or
otherwise") to bring civil action against anyone for alleged past or present violations of
relevant environmental statute(s); it is intended to complement, not to replace or challenge,
agencies' enforcement obligations.
 
(3) Green Amendment (sponsored by  Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, Rep. Patricia
Roybal Caballero, and Rep. Joanne Ferrary)
The Green Amendment proposes to amend the state's Constitution by providing the
people of the state with environmental rights, including the right to a clean and
healthy environment and the right to protection of the environment.
The Green Amendment would amend the New Mexico constitution to elevate
environmental rights to the same level as other civil rights we're all familiar with, such as
freedom of speech, due process, and freedom of religion
A New Mexico Green Amendment would constitutionally mandate that state government
officials protect the environmental rights of all residents equitably, including future
generations. The self-executing amendment will allow legal redress when these rights
are violated by government action; 
The Green Amendment must go through both the Senate and the House before it can
go to the people of New Mexico for a vote.

1/27/23, 3:41 PM New Mexico Environmental Law Mail - NMELC Legislative Priorities for the 2023 Session
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ik=7b638e2eb2&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f%3A1756026715066931723%7Cmsg-f%3A1756042149335113159&si… 4/13
 
Private Right of Action and Bad Actor are being led by Earthworks, and other groups
involved in developing the bills including the Western Environmental Law Center and the
Coalition for Clean and Affordable Energy.  Community advocacy and frontline organizations
that support these bills to date include Citizens Caring for the Future (CCFF) and Interfaith
Power and Light.  NMELC is lending support to these two bills because we believe that they
will help our clients and other communities resist industry’s continued polluting of New
Mexico’s air, land, and water.   
 
The Bad Actor bill will give State agencies the courage and legal authority to say “NO!” to
repeat offenders in the oil and gas industry and to those who, because of financial instability or
lack of insurance, will predictably bail on their obligations to run clean operations or to repair
environmental damage, leaving New Mexico communities stuck with the bill.  It’s important to
note that, while the Oil and Gas Act does not currently contain a “bad actor” provision, several
other State laws do have such provisions, including the Air Quality Control Act, the Water
Quality Act, the Hazardous Waste Act, and the Solid Waste Act.  We believe that it’s
inexcusable that the Oil and Gas Act currently has no similar provisions.
 
In addition, the Private Right of Action bill will allow communities who have been harmed—
or will imminently be harmed—to bring lawsuits against polluters when State agencies are not
adequately addressing environmental violations.  This type of law is common among federal
environmental laws as well as in the New Mexico Mining Act.
 
We hope that state agencies support the Private Right of Action bill as currently written
(it has not been filed yet); it is important that agencies not give deference to oil and gas
industry lobbyists when finalizing the bill language.
 
We invite our supporters to please consider contacting the sponsor of the Private Right
of Action bill, Rep. Matthew McQueen, to thank him for sponsoring the bill and
emphasize why it's important to frontline impacted community members to move it
forward as currently written. You may email Rep. McQueen
at matthew.mcqueen@nmlegis.gov or phone him at (505) 986-4423.
 
We are currently in ongoing internal discussions and taking a hard look at our process for
determining our legislative priorities and policy work. We welcome your input about our
legislative priorities as we strive to find the right balance between capacity and goals while
keeping in mind our ongoing case work.
  
NMELC Participates in Youth United for Climate Crisis Action
(YUCCA) Panel & Action

1/27/23, 3:41 PM New Mexico Environmental Law Mail - NMELC Legislative Priorities for the 2023 Session
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ik=7b638e2eb2&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f%3A1756026715066931723%7Cmsg-f%3A1756042149335113159&si… 5/13
YUCCA invited NMELC Executive Director
Dr. Virginia Necochea to speak on a panel
held on MLK Day that was part of the
Climate Justice & Energy Democracy
Convergence. 
 
YUCCA held their 2nd annual Climate Justice
& Energy Democracy Convergence on
Monday, January 16. Local and national
leaders from the environmental and climate
justice movement discussed policies and
strategies to advance a just energy transition,
with discussion of specific policy proposals
for the 2023 Legislative Session and the
Energy Justice Scorecard. A second panel
discussion focused on the larger climate
movement strategy to build power and win
the changes we need.
 
Dr. Necochea said, "When I think about a just
transition, we're really talking about, if we
name it, those who have power, those who
hold power, and those who don't. We have to
keep at the forefront we're talking about
unjust, inequitable racist systems, oppressive
systems in place, that continue to harm our
community, our people, our environment and
have created so many of these climate
injustices."
 
The next day, Tuesday, January 17, three
NMELC staffers were privileged to join in the
direct action led by YUCCA in the
Roundhouse rotunda. YUCCA Action led a
"Die-In" as a mass mobilization to put
pressure on lawmakers to take action now on
the climate crisis. 
Participants laid down for 7 minutes, one minute for each of the 7 years scientists have
predicted remaining to avert the most catastrophic impacts from global warming. We laid mock
paper tombstones on our bodies, with messages that said what aspect of climate change
caused death, whether widfires, drought, flooding, and heat exposure.
 
Here is a statement from YUCCA's report back:
 
"The Die-In highlighted the devastating losses New Mexicans and communities across the
world have already suffered at the hands of climate disruption caused by fossil fuel pollution.
After the worst wildfires the state has ever seen YUCCA is demanding lawmakers take
immediate action this session to address climate change and protect their future. Youth
leaders are demanding an end to the state’s practice of chasing short-term profits at the
expense of long-term climate stability, economic sustainability, public health & environmental
justice."

Priorities as well at this link.

NMELC Staff Attorney Mara Yarbrough and
Senior Staff Attorney Eric Jantz were both
quoted in an article in Capital & Main about
three legislative bills that would reform the Oil
& Gas Act.
 
Here are some excerpts:
 
"Three bills proposed for the New Mexico
legislative session would shift the state’s
focus on the oil and gas industry by
emphasizing public safety and environmental
protections, denying permits and increasing
penalties for companies in violation of the
law, and making it easier for citizen groups to
sue scofflaw operators. ... Lawyers from the
Western Environmental Law Center (WELC),
Earthworks, the New Mexico Environmental
Law Center (NMELC) and the Coalition for
Clean, Affordable Energy are still finalizing
drafts of the three bills — the Oil and Gas
Justice and Reform Act, a citizens’ suit bill
and a bad actor bill (the last two are not yet
named). ...
“The Oil and Gas Act, as it stands now, doesn’t prioritize public health and communities,” says
Mara Yarbrough, staff attorney at NMELC. “Rather, it prioritizes protecting the oil and gas
industry and protecting the resource from being wasted.” ...
 
“If oil and gas operators are following the law, they have nothing to worry about,” says Eric
Jantz, the senior staff attorney at NMELC, and another author on the bills. “There will be no
flood of lawsuits. There will be no frivolous lawsuits … The argument to the contrary that
there’s going to be this flood of lawsuits is, essentially, the industry conceding that they aren’t
following the law right now. And that’s problematic.”

During our holiday break, The
Paper. covered the Air Quality Control
Board decision to hold a public hearing on
the Mountain View Coalition's Health,
Environment & Equity Impacts proposed
regulation. 
 
Mountain View Community Center President
Nora Garcia, Mountain View Community
Action President Marla Painter and NMELC
Senior Staff Attorney Eric Jantz were quoted
among others in the article in support of the
hearing.
 
Here are some excerpts:
 
"The South Valley is a clear example of
environmental racism and they are fed up
with being the dumping ground for decades
of a dirty industry that no one else wants. The
strength of community organizing paid off for
residents there when, spearheaded by the
Mountain View Coalition and New Mexico
Environmental Law Center (NMELC), they
were able to convince the ABQ-BernCo Air
Quality Control Board (AQCB) to vote
unanimously (5-0) to hold a public hearing on
their proposed Health, Environment and
Equity Impacts Regulation. 
“Most of the burdens and few of the benefits of economic development are experienced by
residents in these overburdened communities,” Eric Jantz, NMELC Senior Staff Attorney told
the AQCB.
 
Historically a rural Latino center of Albuquerque, the South Valley contains some of the most
polluted areas of the state. “We hope that the draft impacts regulation will become a new
beginning toward a healthier environment and improved quality of life,” President of the
Mountain View Neighborhood Association Nora Garcia said. ...
 
“This is the furthest we have ever gotten on having the Air Board or the City address our
concerns and demands for a healthier environment in Bernalillo County, particularly in
vulnerable neighborhoods,” said Marla Painter of Mountain View Community Action. ...

Institute for Policy Studies Issues New Report
"New Mexico at a Crossroads: False Solutions or a Just
Transition?" by Ennedith Lopez, Basav Sen, Emily Li, Taneya Garcia
& Alyssa Garza

1/27/23, 3:41 PM New Mexico Environmental Law Mail - NMELC Legislative Priorities for the 2023 Session
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ik=7b638e2eb2&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f%3A1756026715066931723%7Cmsg-f%3A1756042149335113159&… 12/13
Ennedith Lopez, NMELC's intern through
her fellowship with the Institute for Policy
Studies, co-authored a new report 
called New Mexico at a Crossroads: False
Solutions or Just Transition. 
 
The authors conducted interviews with the
following community organizers and
researchers: Julia Bernal, Director of the
Pueblo Action Alliance; Alejandria Lyons,
former Environmental Justice Organizer for
the Southwest Organizing Project (SWOP);
Josue de Luna Navarro, Climate Policy
Innovator with The Semilla Project and a
former New Mexico Fellow at the Institute for
Policy Studies; and Bob Alvarez and Miriam
Pemberton, Associate Fellows at the Institute
for Policy Studies. 
 
Here's information from the introduction:
 
As the fight to transition off fossil fuels and
into clean, renewable energy gains
momentum, communities and their advocates
face several challenges.
These include a fossil fuel industry still lobbying to hold back renewables, promote dirty
energy, or else peddling false, “greenwashed” solutions that allow it to continue profiting from
pollution. They include the challenge of cleaning up the harmful health and environmental
legacy of fossil fuels, as well as the need to ensure that renewable energy sources are owned
by, and affordable for, the communities who rely on them.
 
The state of New Mexico encapsulates all these trends and more. As a poor, climate-
vulnerable state as well as a leading fossil fuel producer, New Mexico has made important
strides toward an energy transition in recent years. Indigenous and frontline communities in
New Mexico have articulated a clear vision of a just transition away from a polluting, extractive
economy, and are working to implement their vision. But enormous challenges remain.
 
This report focuses on the future of renewable energy in New Mexico and how the state could
lead on a just transition — and even offer a blueprint for other parts of the country. It also
highlights the cost of the use of fossil fuels for New Mexican communities, particularly low-
wealth and Indigenous communities.
 
This report draws upon publicly available information as well as interviews with community
organizers and researchers in New Mexico and elsewhere to make the case for centering
community-led solutions to the climate and energy crisis. ...
