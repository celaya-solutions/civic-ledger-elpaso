Legal experts foresee court battles over denaturalization efforts in fraud scandal
WASHINGTON (TNND) — As the Trump administration looks into revoking the citizenship of immigrants involved in widespread fraud across Minnesota’s social services and Medicaid programs, legal experts warn that efforts of denaturalization, though supported by federal law, will likely be met with “significant” court challenges.
Just days ago, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that it would be conducting an audit of the immigration and citizenship cases of individuals from 19 countries, including Somalia. The audit comes in response to concerns raised that the 98 people charged with defrauding Minnesota’s social welfare programs may have also lied and presented fraudulent documentation during the naturalization process. At least 85 of those charged are of Somali descent; however a vast majority of them are United States citizens. Although it is uncertain how many of them were born in the United States.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared on Fox & Friends that the Trump administration is “"not afraid to use denaturalization.” She also shared that a joint effort is underway between the State Department and DHS to determine steps necessary to revoke citizenship status of Somali immigrants charged or convicted in the Minnesota fraud scandal.
"Under U.S. law, if an individual procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Fox News Digital.
However, attorney David Schoen, who formerly represented President Donald Trump, shared that it would require an "extraordinary circumstance” for a person to become denaturalized, which is a rare occurrence.
There's a mechanism in place for people who are still green card holders, who are fomenting violence on campus and all of that, to be deported,” Schoen told Fox News Digital.
“The rules are clear, both the rules for entry and the rules for dismissing those people from the country.”
The denaturalization process can only occur through a judicial order either through civil proceedings or a criminal conviction for naturalization fraud.
The federal government must provide “clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence which does not leave the issue in doubt” that a person committed fraud during their naturalization process.
