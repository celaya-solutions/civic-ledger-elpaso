Community group sues Doña Ana County Commissioners over Project Jupiter approval
LAS CRUCES, N.M. (KFOX14/CBS4) —A community organization and two residents have filed a lawsuit against the Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners, alleging the county violated state and local law when it approved ordinances tied to the proposed $165 billion Project Jupiter data center in Santa Teresa.
The complaint, filed Oct. 17 in the Third Judicial District Court by the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, represents Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County and residents José Saldaña Jr. of Sunland Park and Vivian Fuller of Santa Teresa.
The lawsuit challenges three ordinances adopted by the county commission.
The first authorizes the issuance of $165 billion in Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRBs) for the project.
The second and third ordinances authorize Local Economic Development Act (LEDA) funding to support Project Jupiter, including anticipated permit fees.
Commissioners approved the measures in two separate 4-1 votes in September and October, with Commissioner Susana Chaparro voting against both times.

Plaintiffs claim the county relied on a single, incomplete application from Project Jupiter’s developers that contained blank and missing pages and lacked critical information necessary to make a fully informed decision.
The filing also states that county officials held private meetings with the project’s developers months before the public hearings and signed a non-disclosure agreement earlier this year.
Plaintiffs argue that these actions limited transparency and prevented residents from fully understanding the project before the votes.
The lawsuit seeks judicial review of the ordinances, a court order invalidating the county’s approval, and a stay halting implementation while the case proceeds.
Project Jupiter, led by Borderplex Digital Assets, would include a hyperscale data center, microgrid, battery storage, and a desalination plant.
County officials have previously described the project as one of the largest potential commercial developments in New Mexico history, with the potential to bring thousands of jobs.
Community members and environmental advocates have raised concerns about the project’s potential strain on water and energy resources and its impacts on surrounding neighborhoods, as well as the longevity of the jobs the center would bring.
