Dear Friends, 
Thanks to your support, the Law Center continued to grow in 2018. After successfully meeting 
a matching grant opportunity, we were able to hire another full-time attorney and hire our first 
ever paralegal. Our staff now numbers eleven, all working to protect New Mexico’s air, land, 
water and communities.
As you will read in our Top 10 Stories of 2018, we and our clients achieved a significant victory 
in the Augustin Plains Ranch water grab case, protecting millions of gallons of drinking water 
from being siphoned off for private gain. On the other hand, there was a hard defeat in the NM 
Supreme Court on the Copper Rule – allowing pollution of groundwater below any copper 
mine in the state – and a setback when the Mt. Taylor uranium mine “return to operational” 
permit was granted. Other cases are progressing.
Thank you for your continued support,  
which makes all this work possible.
Yours truly,
Douglas Meiklejohn 
Executive Director

THANK YOU
“We appreciate very much that such a small and dedicated group 
does such a great job against such odds and big money and feel 
that when we give to you we are investing not only in the environ-
mental future of New Mexico, but the entire country.”
■  Stuart Feen and Sunny Sonnenschein –  
Santa Fe, NM and Chicago, IL (supporters since 2012)
“We could never have been able to stand up for the families in San Jose and Mountain View [neighborhoods in 
Albuquerque] without the help and support from the staff of NMELC who truly care for the families of New Mexico.”

Administration  
& general  •

 
Augustin Plains Ranch – Our clients celebrated a big victory in August when the State Engineer 
denied (again) as speculative Augustin Plains Ranch’s most recent application for withdrawal of 17 
billion gallons per year of groundwater, threatening agricultural and drinking water wells in the 
area. The Ranch has appealed the decision. (Clients: nearly 100 ranchers, farmers, & other property 
owners; attorneys: Douglas Meiklejohn & Jaimie Park).
Santolina Proposed Development – Our 
clients have appealed the Level A Master 
Plan to the Court of Appeals and the Level 
B1 plan to District Court. The developer, 
Western Albuquerque Land Holdings, has 
not met the requirement to show where it will 
get water for the projected 90,000 residents on 
the West Mesa. The Albuquerque Bernalillo 
County Water Utility Authority has not made 
a commitment to provide water and sewer 
services and has advised the developers that 
substantial infrastructure needs to be built to 
use recycled water for water service. (Clients: 
SouthWest Organizing Project, NM Health Equity Working Group, Center for Social Sustainable 
Systems, neighborhood & acequia associations, several individuals; attorneys: Douglas Meiklejohn 
& Jaimie Park).
Copper Mine Rule – The New Mexico Supreme Court upheld the Copper Mine Rule. The Rule sets 
the “point of compliance” with water quality standards outside a mine pit’s area of open hydrolog-
ic containment. This “strategic containment” is contrary to the Water Quality Act’s purpose of pre-
venting and abating water pollution. Other industries see the 
Rule as a model for easing permitting and reducing opportu-
nities for public participation. (Clients: Amigos Bravos, Gila 
Resources Information Project; attorneys: Douglas Meiklejohn 
& Jaimie Park).
Copper Flat Copper Mine – Copper Flat is the first cop-
per mine permit process under the Copper Rule. The state 
Environment Department (NMED) granted a groundwa-
ter discharge permit and our clients petitioned the Water 
Quality Control Commission (WQCC) for a review. Separately, the Mining & Minerals Division 
(MMD) held a mine operating permit hearing. Our clients oppose the three regulatory require-
ments remaining for a mine permit: 1) an NMED Determination that permitted activities will 
comply with environmental standards; 2) approved financial assurance; and 3) Bureau of Land 
Management approval of the proposed mining operation. (Clients: Turner Ladder Ranch, Hillsboro 
Pitchfork Ranch, Gila Resources Information Project; attorneys: Charles de Saillan & Jaimie Park).
Mt. Taylor Mine – The Mining Commission approved the Mt. Taylor Mine “return to operational” 
permit. The decision essentially means anything a mining company does that “disturbs” the land 
is mining and that “mining” does not require ore extraction. The mine was in its 19th year of 
“standby” status and would have had to begin reclamation in late 2019. The decision allows the 
mine’s owner, Rio Grande Resources, to avoid mine reclamation. Our clients have appealed the 
decision to the 1st Judicial District Court. (Clients: Amigos Bravos, the Multicultural Alliance for a 
Safe Environment; attorney: Eric Jantz).
4  5
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Consent Order – A US District Court judge ruled that 
the portion of our client’s lawsuit seeking penalties can go forward. Our clients had sued LANL 
management and the Department of Energy (DOE) over repeated violations of the 2005 Consent 
Order on cleanup, accruing $272 million in possible fines. In allowing the case to proceed, the 
judge noted that the DOE and LANL management had not proven that violations would not con-
tinue. (Client: Nuclear Watch New Mexico; attorney: Jon Block).
LANL Discharge Permits – It was a busy year for discharge permits at LANL. Our client, 
Communities for Clean Water (CCW), received a hearing on groundwater discharge permit (DP) 
1793, which regulates disposal of wastewater generated by the monitoring and cleanup of chro-
mium, RDX, and perchlorate in the drinking water aquifer under LANL and the Pueblo of San 
Ildefonso. The hearing resulted from a 2017 Court of Appeals decision for 
our clients that NMED and the WQCC violated the Water Quality Act in 
previously denying a public hearing on the permit. CCW also challenged 
DP-1132, which regulates the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility 
(RLWTF), arguing that because there is no discharge from the facility, 
a permit under the Water Quality Act is inappropriate and the facility 
should be regulated as a hazardous waste site under the more stringent 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The case is on appeal to the WQCC. In a sepa-
rate case, Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety (a member of CCW) asked Region 6 of the EPA 
to remove the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) discharge permit for 
Outfall 051 from the RLWTF because there is no longer a discharge. Region 6 refused, as did the 
EPA Environmental Appeals Board. The case is now at the federal 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
(Attorney: Jon Block).
Sunport Extension/Woodward Improvements – Mayor Keller withdrew Albuquerque’s sup-
port for the Sunport Boulevard Extension west across I-25 down to Broadway. That project and 
the Woodward project from Broadway to 2nd Street are almost entirely within the City. In July, 
our clients submitted comments on Bernalillo County’s third Environmental Assessment, arguing 
the EA did not meet Federal Highway Administration requirements and that the County, which 
is pushing the projects, failed to address air quality-related health impacts. (Clients: SouthWest 
Organizing Project, Steven & Esther Abeyta; attorney: Jon Block).
South Valley Air Quality Issues – Our clients filed a Petition for a hearing with the Albuquerque-
Bernalillo Air Quality Control Board on yet another air quality permit in the South Valley, this 
time for a hot mix asphalt plant. The Board has refused in the past to consider cumulative impacts 
on air quality when making permit decisions. In 2016, the EPA agreed to investigate a federal 
Title VI civil rights complaint our clients filed claiming a disproportionate burden on low-income 
communities and communities of color. The investigation has been on hold pending the Board’s 
decision on engaging in mediation with our client. (Clients: SouthWest Organizing Project, Esther 
& Steven Abeyta, Mountain View Neighborhood Association, Nora Garcia; attorney: Eric Jantz).
 Water Quality Rule Changes – NMED filed a petition to amend Water 
Quality Act regulations with the WQCC, which adopted a new ground-
water discharge rule granting variances in perpetuity. Variances allow 
facilities to avoid compliance with regulations and had been limited to 
five years. The new rule eliminates the mandatory public notice and 
public hearing on a variance every five years. Our clients appealed 
the decision to the Court of Appeals. NMED withdrew another pro-
posed rule change to allow “minor changes” to permits without pub-
lic notice or a hearing. “Minor” changes could include significant 
permit information such as change in discharge location, increase in 
discharge volume, and change in discharge quality. (Clients: Amigos 
Bravos, Gila Resources Information Project; attorney: Jaimie Park).
