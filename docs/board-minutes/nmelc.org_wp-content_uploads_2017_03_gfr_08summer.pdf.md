“T
his is the fullest I’ve ever 
seen this place,” overheard in 
Courtroom II just before the hearing 
of oral arguments on May 12th, 
2008 in Denver, CO. Community 
members from Crownpoint and 
Church Rock, including nine middle-
schoolers, Students Against Uranium 
Mining or SAUM (see photo right), 
drove up the night before to attend 
the hearing that will directly affect 
the quality of their drinking water. 
Eric Jantz, lead 
attorney from 
the Law Center, 
represented clients 
Eastern Navajo 
Diné Against 
Uranium Mining 
(ENDAUM) and 
Southwest Research 
and Information 
Center (SRIC) in their appeal 
against the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission’s (NRC) granting in-
situ leach mining permits to Hydro 
Resources Inc. (HRI).  In his opening 
remarks Eric said “the question 
before you today, your honors, is 
whether the NRC can disregard 
radiation from the mine waste at 
Section 17 and continue to do its 
statutory duty to protect the public?”
  The Law Center’s clients charge 
that the NRC has not met its duty 
to protect the public by permitting 
HRI to mine for uranium in the 
community aquifer. The NRC stated 
HRI would be mining in the part of 
the aquifer that is already naturally 
contaminated by uranium and is not 
drinking water. HRI also argued that 
the mining would be in a part of the 
aquifer that is contained, but with 
further prodding from the judges, 
HRI stated the portion of the aquifer 
that would be mined was vertically 
confined but not horizontally 
confined. To that, Judge Carlos Lucero 
responded, “I do not understand it. 
If it’s just vertically confined and 
not horizontally confined, what’s to 
keep this water from flowing into 
the municipal drinking water?”  In 
further questioning, Eric responded 
that the mining would also take place 
¼ mile from the municipal water 
supply well. In response, Judge David 
M. Ebel said “I can’t even begin to 
understand that.”  
   After 12 years of fighting to stop 
HRI’s plans of uranium mining, and 
months of work by the legal team 
(including Diane Curran of Harmon, 
Curran, Spielberg & Eisenberg, L.L.P. 
and Zackeree Kelin of DNA-People’s 
Legal Services, Inc.), the two opposing 
parties were scheduled only 30 
minutes total to state their case and 
answer questions from the panel of 
judges. But, due to the number of 
questions from the judges and the 
depth of their interest in the issue, the 
hearing took an hour. The judges were 
obviously astonished as to how these 
permits could have been granted. 
Eric’s presentation was confident, 
clear and relaxed, which attests to the

Mora Fights Oil and 
Gas Drilling
W
ith help from the Law Center, 
New Mexico’s groundwater 
will be safer, due to the release of a 
stringent new “oil pit rule” on May 
9, 2008. Oil pits hold wastes from 
oil and gas wells, which can include 
carcinogens such as benzene, 
toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene – 
a resounding victory for our state’s 
water, wildlife and human health.  
    Here are some of the new 
requirements:
• For the first time, all pits must 
be lined with heavy-duty liners, 
unless issued a special exemption.        
• When groundwater is less than 50 
feet from the pit, companies must 
use “closed-loop systems” (above 
ground tanks) rather than pits.
• Waste can no longer be spread 
onsite, but must be sent to an 
approved landfill. The pit must 
be reclaimed unless the site is 
specifically exempted.
    In December, Oil Conservation 
Division (OCD) Director Mark 
Fesmire told the Santa Fe New 
Mexican that in the past 15 years 
the OCD had investigated 800 
instances of oil and gas well-related 
contamination, roughly half were 
due to oil pits.  He expects that with 
this new rule that contamination 
will “drop down to nothing.”
    “It’s a good rule,” affirms Law 
Center Staff Attorney Eric Jantz.  
“For a relatively small investment, 
there will be a significant positive 
impact on the environment.”
    This summer, industry groups 
sued to overturn the new rule. On 
behalf of Oil & Gas Accountability 
Project, the Law Center successfully 
intervened in the 
suits, and will 
represent our client 
in proceedings later 
this year.

moratorium on all oil and gas drilling in Mora County. 
During the moritorium, we seek to work with the County to 
amend its current ordinance with specific oil and gas

NM’s Water Quality Act
  nmenvirolaw.org       3
Case Updates
Law Center & GRIP defend WQA
T  
he The New Mexico Water 
Quality Control Commission 
(WQCC) is poised to decide whether 
the groundwater below the Tyrone 
mine, located outside of Silver City, is 
worthy of protection under the New 
Mexico Water Quality Act (WQA). 
Phelps Dodge Tyrone (“Tyrone”), 
now a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Phoenix-based Freeport-McMoRan, 
argued that it doesn’t need to 
regrade and cover waste rock and 
ore stockpiles that cover thousands 
of acres of land within Tyrone’s 
permit area.  Although Tyrone 
essentially admits that regrading and 
covering would prevent acid rock 
drainage from further contaminating 
groundwater, Tyrone officials insist 
that the groundwater under the 
mine is not “a place of withdrawal 
of water for present or reasonably 
foreseeable future use” and thus 
is not protected under the state’s 
WQA.  The Law Center and its client, 
the Silver City-based environmental 
advocacy group Gila Resources 
Information Project (GRIP), counter 
that the Tyrone mine overlies a 
valuable groundwater supply, and 
therefore, the affected aquifers 
qualify as “places of withdrawal” and 
must be protected under the WQA.
    On July 7, 2008 the WQCC heard 
closing oral arguments from the New 
Mexico Environment Department 
(NMED), Tyrone and GRIP.  “Each 
party was granted one hour to 
present to the Commission,” recalls 
Bruce Frederick, Law Center 
attorney for GRIP. “We supported 
NMED’s arguments and also gave 
the Commission legal argument 
and additional evidence that went 
beyond NMED’s theory of the case.”
    If the WQCC rules in favor of 
Tyrone, it would potentially be 
authorizing the company and 
other polluters to use the state’s 
precious groundwater as a dump.
    We do not expect a decision 
before the end of the year.  
“W
hat happens if plutonium 
gets into the water supply?”  
Our clients, Amigos Bravos and 
Concerned Citizens for Nuclear 
Safety are not saying that will 
happen, but strongly believe that 
the potential for the Project to divert 
contamination from Los Alamos 
National Lab (LANL) should be fully 
and publicly discussed and analyzed 
before the Project goes forward. 
    The Law Center became involved 
after the Forest Service (FS) and 
Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM) decided to issue permits and 
rights-of-way for the 
Project in February 
2008.                        
by Allyson Siwik, Executive Director of GRIP
 A month later, the Law Center filed 
an administrative appeal of their 
decisions to the FS and the Interior 
Board of Land Appeals, respectively, 
arguing that the agencies violated 
the National Environmental Policy 
Act (NEPA) by failing to disclose and 
adequately analyze the impact of 
LANL-origin contaminants on the 
Project in an environmental impact 
statement (EIS).   LANL is a major 
source of radiological, hazardous 
and toxic contamination, and the 
Project will take water out of the 
Rio Grande downstream from this 
source.  The EIS prepared by the 
agencies dismissed the 
prospect of LANL 
contamination as “speculative” and 
omitted to even identify LANL on a 
site map. 
    Notwithstanding the overwhelming 
evidence showing LANL-origin 
contaminants have reached the River
and will likely continue to reach 
the River at the Project’s place of 
diversion, both federal agencies 
summarily dismissed the appeals.  
The agencies’ decisions may now be 
appealed to Federal District Court 
and the Law Center and its clients are 
evaluating this option.

M
ining is one of the most toxic 
industries in the West.  Despite 
that, before 1993 New Mexico had no 
law requiring reclamation of hard 
rock mines. The enactment of the 
New Mexico Mining Act changed that 
dramatically; it is in many ways the 
most stringent mining law in the 
West. 
    The Act governs extraction of 
hardrock minerals, including copper, 
gold, silver, and molybdenum; it also 
covers mining of uranium from open 
pit mines and underground mines.  
(In situ leach uranium mining is 
governed by the federal Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission.)  The Act 
was the culmination of a three year 
effort by then State Representative 
Gary King (now New Mexico’s 
Attorney General), whose district 
included a gold mine in the Ortiz 
Mountains that had polluted both 
surface and ground water.    
    Rep. King’s first two efforts to 
pass mining legislation did not 
succeed.  “The 1993 legislative 
session involved a more determined 
effort by King and by environmental 
and industry groups to address 
hardrock mining,” remembers 
Douglas Meiklejohn, one of the lead 
environmental lobbyists for the 
Act.  He recalls that three mining 
bills were introduced that year:  
Rep. King’s bill, a bill drafted by 
environmental groups, and a bill 
backed by the mining industry.
The three bills were the subject of 
extensive legislative committee 
hearings and negotiations by all 
interested parties.  Ultimately, a 
version of King’s bill was enacted.  
“There were a lot of people 
involved,” recalls Meiklejohn, “but 
there were only a few of us left when 
we agreed on the final version, at 
two in the morning on a Monday late 
in the session.” 
    The Act includes mandates that 
new mines be planned to provide for 
reclamation, and be reclaimed to self-
sustaining ecosystems compatible 
with surrounding life zones.  It 
This issue marks the third of four Green Fire Reports that will celebrate the Law Center’s twentieth anniversary over 
the next year.  As part of that celebration, we are happy to share Twenty Years|Twenty Stories, focusing on the clients, 
volunteers, staff members, donors, and victories that have seen the Law Center from its earliest days to the present.
Larry King of ENDAUM
I
n 1994, the Gallup Independent 
ran a front page headline 
announcing that Hydro Resources 
Inc. (HRI) had been granted a 
license by the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission to mine uranium in 
the Church Rock-Crownpoint area. It 
was a headline that alarmed Mitchell 
Capitan, a Crownpoint resident 
who had worked at the MobilOil 
pilot-scale in situ leach uranium 
mine near his home, and who had 
watched as the federal government 
allowed the company to abandon 
the site after it failed for six years to 
clean up the groundwater.  Later  
    
  that year, Mitchell and 
his wife Rita formed 
Eastern Navajo 
Diné Against Uranium Mining 
(ENDAUM) in order to protect their 
community from the devastation 
of another uranium boom. As the 
organization grew, Larry King was 
asked to join the board of ENDAUM 
and has been serving since 1997.
    King, a Church Rock resident 
and rancher, also knows firsthand 
the effects of uranium mining 
on communities. He spent seven 
years working for an underground 
uranium mining company and 
recalls the 100 million gallons of 
radioactive water that spilled into 
the Rio Puerco in 1979. This spill  
    occurred the same year as 
the Three Mile Island 
nuclear accident 
and was a larger 
contamination 
event, but re-
ceived little press. 
Currently, King 
lives 1,000 feet 
from a uranium 
tailings pile. 
“When the winds 
shift, we get some dust off of that 
pile,” he says. 
    Looking back on the work that 
ENDAUM has done in the Navajo 
community, he says, “There are a

willing to assist a grassroots

Thomas & Eleanor Wootten
Editor’s Note:  Tom Wootten, a long-
time supporter of the Law Center, 
passed away in August 2007, a week 
after his interview for this article.
“W
e renew our expressed 
desire that Doug 
Meiklejohn and the staff he has 
assembled be cloned,” wrote Eleanor 
and Tom Wootten in 1993, in what 
must be one of the most colorful 
statements of support that the 
Law Center has ever received.  It 
was a true compliment from two 
champions of New Mexico’s public 
lands, who fought for rangeland 
reform, riparian enhancement, 
wildlife protection and wilderness 
designations.  
    Their passion for protection led 
them to the Law Center in 1993 
when they successfully worked 
with the Coalition of Conservation 
Organizations in Las Cruces to 
prevent construction of the Kenzin 
gas pipeline and several water 
troughs for cattle on a Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM) allotment 
that was located within a wilderness 
study area.  That year, the Law 
Center also represented Tom in his 
successful effort to be designated as 
an affected interest regarding the 
Flying W grazing allotment in the 
Mimbres Resource Area.  
    “I was relatively new to the 
environmental movement when we 
took on the Kenzin Pipeline work,” 
remembers Tom. “I remember this 
was the first time I was introduced 
to lawyers who worked pro bono 
for environmental groups.  It was 
absolutely wonderful to have 
someone of Doug Meiklejohn’s 
stature working for us.” 
    Since that time, the Wootten 
family has generously supprted 
the Law Center’s work, despite 
the fact that we now work more 
closely on community-centered 
cases than public lands cases.  Three 
cases of particular interest to Tom 
were the Sunland Park landfill and 
incinerator case near Las Cruces, 
the Cunningham Hill gold mine 
in Santa Fe County, and the Dog 
Canyon landfill near Alamogordo.  
The connective tissue between 
these cases was the Law Center’s 
work to stop entities from profiting 
off of the land to the detriment of 
communities – both human and 
natural – that depend upon that land.  
    “Although my first love is 
New Mexico wild lands, I can’t 
underestimate the importance of 
community issues,” Tom said.  “It 
provides a great deal of comfort to 
me that the dollars that I give to the 
Law Center go to important fights 
that I can’t fight personally,” such 
as the Sunland Park case where 
low-income kids were breathing in 
the smoke from a medical waste 
incinerator sited a short distance 
away from their elementary school.
    Tom added that although he 
believes that concerned citizens 
should have the right to participate 
in governmental proceedings that

“ I ’ve always said that tailings ponds were like diapers; they can only 
            hold so much before you have a big mess on your hands.”
B
rian Shields, Executive Director 
of Amigos Bravos, and I were 
hip-deep into our interview about 
Molycorp when I had to hang up 
to change my daughter’s diaper.  
Apologizing after I called him back, 
he laughed and said, “I’ve always said 
that tailings ponds were like diapers; 
they can only hold so much before 
you have a big mess on your hands.”
    Brian’s quick comeback sums 
up my experience with the folks 
at Amigos Bravos, a non-profit 
Rio Grande watershed advocacy 
organization based in Taos:  they are 
able to distill their highly technical 
knowledge of the Rio Grande 
watershed into language that even 
someone drenched in spit-up can 
understand.  It is a talent that has 
served the Law Center well, as we 
have represented Amigos Bravos on 
several highly technical cases, the 
crown jewel of which has been our 
work on the Molycorp molybdenum 
mine near Questa, north of Taos.
            
   Flying over the Sangre de Cristo 
range, your eyes are immediately 
drawn to a pit that was carved into 
the mountainside over the course 
of twenty years. From the air you 
can also see more than 300 million 
tons of waste rock that tower over 
the town of Questa, as well as the 
Red River, a tiny ribbon glinting 
silver at the base of the mountain. 
    It is not until you are standing 
next to the river, that you 
realize that it is a 
dead stream 
Amigos Bravos’ Brian Sheilds
the closeout plan, and I remember 
that Doug was really incredible in the 
hearings.  After Moly realized that we 
had counsel and experts, they came 
back to the table with a financial 
surety offer of $50 million.  By the 
end of the hearing, they offered $90 
million. Doug managed to get us into 
negotiations with the State and the 
company, and we walked away with 
a total of $157 million in reclamation 
bonds for both the minesite and the 
tailings piles.” Until the Law Center’s 
success several years later with the 
Phelps Dodge copper mines, this was 
the largest financial bond ever posted 
by a mining company.  In addition, 
the company is required to reclaim 
the site to a self-sustaining ecosystem 
once the mine is closed.  While the 
Molycorp reclamation chickens 
are not yet hatched, progress is 
being made towards the eventual 
reclamation of the Molycorp mine–
and the rescue of the Red River.
    Brian has never counted up 
the hours, but he 
believes that the Law 
Center’s representation on the 
Molycorp proceedings alone would 
have cost the organization at least 
a half-million dollars.  And while 
the Law Center’s free and low-cost 
legal services are important for 
his non-profit group, he says that 
Amigos Bravos also relies on the 
Law Center’s expertise, experience 
and willingness to join them in 
taking on some of the

– a casualty of a toxic brew known 
as “acid rock drainage,” that 
results when water seeps through 
the mine’s waste rock piles, 
picking up contaminants such as 
arsenic, cadmium, chromium, 
lead and sulfate.   
    Since its inception in 1988, 
Amigos Bravos has worked to clean 
up the Red River.  As one of the first 
major tests of the 1993 Mining Act, 
the Molycorp case was headed up 
by the Law Center Staff Attorney 
Doug Wolf. “We had dual goals,” 
remembers Brian.  “We wanted to 
protect surface and ground water, 
while at the same time implementing 
the Mining Act as one of the most 
stringent laws of its kind in the 
U.S.”  The permitting proceedings 
that began in 1999 marked the first 
time that the NM Environment 
Department had regulated the 
mine in its 80 years of operation.
    Brian remembers the Closeout 
and Reclamation plan battle against 
Molycorp well.  “Moly (Molycorp) 
first came in with an offer of $15 
million for financial assurance 
(the amount of money that a 
company must guarantee the State 
if the company is ever unable to 
perform reclamation.)  At that point 
we worked with Doug and our 
mining engineer, Jim Kuipers, to 
put together our own reclamation 
plan, which put a $400 million 
price tag on cleanup at the mine.

hinking about his fourteen years 
as a Law Center Board Member, 
Frank I. Sanchez found it difficult 
to choose his proudest moment. 
There was the meeting with the 
Sunland Park community leaders, 
when he observed the respect that 
they had for the Law Center and the 
work Doug Meiklejohn had done 
on their solid waste case. There was 
the visit to the San Ildefonso Pueblo, 
where Law Center board members 
and foundation staffers observed 
actual dumping by Los Alamos 
National Laboratory on tribal lands. 
They heard tribal elders speak of 
the difficulties they encountered 
in their attempts to stop it and 
how the Law Center helped the 
tribe have a more effective voice 
in dealing with the Lab. “It had a 
deep effect on me and the visitors,” 
he recalls. But the achievement 
he is most proud of is the Navajo 
Nation’s and Law Center’s roles 
in getting the moratorium on 
uranium mining passed in 2005. 
“We worked with many partners to 
successfully advocate for a law with 
wide impact. I am very proud of the 
representation we gave to the Navajo 
communities and Nation.”
    Sanchez was born in Roswell, 
NM where he has worked as a 
community organizer and advocate 
for most of his life. He has spent 
over 20 years on voting rights and 
welfare rights initiatives in his home 
town and around southeastern 
New Mexico.  He has worked 
another 20 years with community 
organizations, focusing on social and 
environmental justice issues.  “It’s 
been an incredible journey,” he
says, “working with these dedicated 
people and community leaders, 
their commitment to economic and 
environmental justice, gives me 
energy and inspires me to continue 
the work.” Currently, he is the 
Senior Program Officer with the 
Needmor Fund, a private foundation 
that funds community organizing in 
Southwest and nationally.
    The Law Center thanks Frank 
Sanchez for his continued expertise 
and guidance.

O
n November 1, 2007, for only 
the third time in 136 years, 
the US House of Representatives 
passed a bill (HR 2262) that would 
substantially change the way that 
hard rock mining occurs on public 
lands.  The bill passed handily 
with the vote of 244 to 166.  
    The bill strives to protect crucial 
drinking water supplies and 
other natural resources, special 
places, taxpayers, fish and wildlife 
habitat, and the health and well 
being of our communities.  The 
bill charges a royalty for the first 
time ever and allows our federal 
land managers to balance mining 
with other land uses.  The bill 
finally puts hardrock mining on 
par with other extractive industries 
like oil, gas, and coal mining.
    Reform is long overdue.  The 
1872 Mining Law was signed into 
law on May 10, 1872 to encourage 
development of the West and to 
settle land disputes.  The law governs 
hardrock mining on 
270 million acres

 Achieves nearly every 
goal the Gila Resources and 
Information Center sought for 
the Phelps Dodge T yrone permit 
of publically owned lands 
mostly in the West.  This 
constitutes almost one-
fourth of all the land in 
the United States, or two-
thirds of the public lands 
owned by all Americans.
    While modern mines 
have massive environmental 
footprints, use chemicals 
such as cyanide and sulfuric 
acid, and generate huge 
quantities of waste, the 1872 
Mining Law has no environmental 
provisions.  Mining has left an 
ugly environmental and taxpayer 
legacy, with 40% of the headwaters 
of western watersheds polluted and 
a clean-up bill of over $50 billion.  
Although a temporary moratorium 
currently halts the sale of public 
lands (under the law, land can be 
patented – or privatized – for as 
little as $2.50 per acre), $245 billion 
worth of mineral bearing public 
lands have been “sold” to mining 
companies under the law – a land 
area the same size as Connecticut.
    Enactment of a mining law 
reform bill would be a giant step 
towards dealing with mining’s 
toxic legacy preventing new mining 
pollution and bringing mining on 
public lands into the 21st century.  
    However, if it is to have a chance 
at becoming law, it must pass the 
Senate.  Because New Mexico’s 
senators are the ranking members 
of the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, New Mexicans have 
a critical role to play.  
1872 Mining Law Reform Progress
Half-way there, but still a long row to hoe!
by Roger Featherstone, Earthworks
HR 2262 at a Glance
Protects Special Places  
from Irresponsible Mining
• Wilderness study areas, roadless 
areas, and lands in the Wild and 
Scenic River System will be off limits 
to exploration and development.
• Protects National Parks and National 
Monuments by assuring that large-scale 
mining operations do not adversely 
affect these national treasures.
• Gives land managers the ability to 
balance mining with other land uses.
• Gives state, local and tribal 
government the ability to put 
lands off limits to mining.
Establishes Environmental Standards
• Mine sites must be reclaimed 
to sustain either pre-mining 
uses, or uses conforming to the 
applicable land use plan.
• Fish and wildlife habitat 
must be restored.
• Operations must minimize damage to 
surface and groundwater resources.
• Prohibits perpetual pollution – after 
mining ceases, mine operators need 
to meet water quality standards 
without permanent treatment.
Implements Fiscal Reforms
• Ends patenting – the selling of 
public lands at 1872 prices.
• Establishes an 8% royalty for new mines 
and a 4% royalty for existing mines.
• Requires reclamation bonds with 
clear cleanup standards.
• Creates a fund to clean up 
abandoned mines.
• Creates a Community Impact 
Assistance Fund.

O
n May 20th 2008, the New 
Mexico Association of 
Grantmakers conducted a funders’ 
forum entitled “Perspectives 
on Oil and Gas Development 
in New Mexico: Our Economy, 
Environment, Health and Future” 
moderated by Doug Meiklejohn.  
The philanthropic community 
was briefed on issues related to 
oil and gas development in the 
interior West.  Experts included 
Ben Alexander, socio-economist at 
Headwaters Economics in Montana; 
Lance Astrella, oil and gas attorney 
from Denver who represents 
individuals and municipalities; 
Tweeti Blancett, a San Juan County 
rancher; and Dr. Theo Colborn, an 
environmental health analyst.  The 
experts addressed public health 
issues, comparative economics of 
oil and gas development, and legal 
strategies and issues that could 
further inform the local Galisteo 
Basin debate as the community 
and county continue the process of 
developing an ordinance for Santa 
Fe County.  
    The Law Center along with 
Common Ground United* and 
Conservation Voters New Mexico 
hosted a public education meeting 
in the evening with these same 
experts (except Tweeti Blancett). 
The meeting entitled “Everything 
you wanted to know about Oil 
and Gas but Were Afraid to Ask” 
was moderated by Sandy Buffett, 
Director of Conservation Voters New 
Mexico. The Unitarian Universalist 
Church was packed with well over 
100 people who came to learn 
more about other western states’ 
experiences that could apply to 
Santa Fe county and inform the 
ordinance framework and drafting 
process.   The bottom line is that 
citizens must continue to demand 
full accountability, transparency 
and participation in the regulatory 
process, and we must take control of 
the information about this industry 
and disseminate it broadly in public 
education campaigns. Objective 
baseline studies 
are conducted by 
both state agencies 
and independent 
experts in order to 
have data of what 
was present before 
any drilling occurs. 
These baseline 
studies should 
address a range of 
concerns including 
economics, public 
health, air and 
water quality and 
biological and 
cultural resource 
impacts.
    The biggest news 
is that oil and gas 
development is not the economic 
employment engine it was forty 
years ago in the West as employment 
numbers have nearly flat-lined for 
the past thirty years while many 
other economic sectors have greatly 
outpaced mining development in 
the state.  However, numbers are 
not available for the actual costs to 
New Mexico in lost land use due to 
oil and gas waste contamination; 
lost employment for ranchers; lost 
water resources; public health costs 
of increased respiratory illnesses 
and other associated afflictions. 
Finally, it is up to local communities 
and their county governments to 
determine whether oil and gas 
development in the Rocky Mountain 
West is compatible with the new 
increasingly diverse economies that 
depend on quality of life and pristine 
environments to bring economic 
growth to our region.
    The Law Center is grateful to 
the New Mexico Association of 
Grantmakers for its interest in 
further educating its members about 
this most important issue; and, to 
Jan Brooks for her efforts to organize 
both the funders’ forum and public 
education event. Thanks are also due 
to Common Ground United and the 
Oil & Gas Accountability Project for 
their support. We greatly appreciate 
the in kind services and individual 
support provided by Theo Colborn, 
Ben Alexander, Lance Astrella, Doug 
Stewart and Tweeti Blancett; as well 
as Michael Motley, Peter Ellzey, 
Michael O’Neil, Paul Margeston and 
Jennifer Marshall.

Uranium Bill Vetoed
    
SB #487, Abandoned Uranium 
Mine Reclamation Fees, sponsored 
by Sen. David Ulibarri, would 
have imposed a small tax on new 
uranium mines in New Mexico that 
would contribute to an “abandoned 
uranium mine reclamation fund.” 
In theory, the bill provided for clean 
up of old uranium mines but in 
fact it would have provided very 
little funds. In its final form, the tax 
collected would have provided, over 
approximately 20-30 years, enough 
funds to clean 1 or 2 abandoned 
mines; currently there are hundreds 
of abandoned uranium mines in 
New Mexico. The bill also would 
not have authorized the state to 
recover the costs of clean up from 
the owner of the abandoned mine, 
if that owner was still a functioning 
company. 
    The bill passed the House and, 
with amendments, passed the 
Senate. The Law Center, along 
with many other environmental 
and community organizations, 
rallied public support to ask 
Governor Richardson to veto the 
bill. Thankfully, he did on March 
3rd, reporting to the press that New 
Mexico “deserves better.” 
   Thanks to all of our members for 
their phone calls and emails!
                                  
 Restrictive Impact Statements  
 for Rule Makers Avoided
HB #310, Regulatory Impact 
Statement Requirements, 
sponsored by Representative 
Richard Berry, would have 
required state agencies to prepare 
regulatory impact statements 
when they proposed to adopt 
new regulations. This bill would 
have significantly slowed down 
agencies’ ability to adopt new 
regulations in order to protect 
communities or the environment. 
The Law Center, with other 
environmental groups, negotiated 
with Rep. Berry, and although 
substantial progress was made, 
negotiations did not result in an 
agreement. Rep. Berry decided not 
to pursue the bill.

n June 26, 2008 GRIP, 
represented by the Law 
Center, settled its appeal of 
Chino mine’s proposal to 
dilute its contaminated waste 
water with clean groundwater 
rather than use more effective 
treatment technology.      
    Freeport-McMoRan, parent 
company of the Chino mine, 
has agreed to use an advanced 
form of reverse osmosis to 
remove metals and sulfates 
from the wastewater the mine 
will produce for hundreds of 
years after mining stops.  
    This win will save 9,000 
acre-feet of clean groundwater 
annually!

S
ince 1992, the award winning 
and Santa Fe-based GreenMoney 
Journal has been covering socially 
and environmentally responsible 
business, investing and shopping 
information. The goal has been to 
help people align their money with 
their values from the supermarket to 
the stock market. So we are teaming 
up with NMELC to help you and 
them make money and make a 
difference in the world.
    I have been so impressed with the 
work that NMELC has accomplished 
over the past twenty years.  Their 
need for revenue is growing in 
order to meet the challenges 
ahead; therefore the GreenMoney 
Journal will donate half of all 
subscriptions’ revenues that come 
in from members of NMELC. With 
your $50 one year subscription 
of the publication, a full $25 per 
subscription will go to NMELC to 
help them in creating the future we 
all want to live in.
    Last year GreenMoney Journal 
celebrated its 15th Anniversary with 
a special issue (Summer 2007) that 
asked a variety of leaders to give 
their vision of the next 15 years. 
The writers included futurist Hazel 
Henderson, social investing Leader 
Amy Domini, Stonyfield Farm CEO 
Gary Hirshberg, and from Ecotrust 
Spencer Beebe who wrote on the 
importance of Bioregions.             
Here is an excerpt from that article:
“Everything is changing in the face 
of global warming. The industrial 
economy is an artifact of cheap oil. 
There will be a transition from an 
industrial to an ecological economy. 
It will either be very chaotic and 
destructive to human systems, 
especially the poorest of the poor, 
or it might be a social evolution to a 
healthier, more equitable and more 
reliably prosperous knowledge-
based economy...The key is to find 
ways to release the energy of people 
in place. The only truly unlimited 
and untapped resource left in a 
world of increasing scarcity is the 
infinite creativity of the human 
imagination. Imagination, with even 
the slightest nod of encouragement 
and a little money, enables even 
the least advantaged among us to 
improve their lives in the places they 
live. Imagination is the catalytic, the 
metabolic process that will underlie  
a new economy of place.”
    
So subscribe today at the following

half of all that comes in.

Dear Friends, 
We have two new exciting 
opportunities to tell you about. 
The first is a terrific offer from Law 
Center supporter Cliff Feigenbaum, 
editor and publisher of GreenMoney 
Journal, which is celebrating 15 
years this year.  We wrote a story for 
his spring online issue about New 
Mexico and the Law Center, and 
Cliff thought of a great way we could 
creatively support and inform Law 
Center members.
    The second exciting opportunity is 
from Law Center supporter Dr. Leslie 
Lakind, truly a local leader in Santa 
Fe’s environmental health. We want 
Green Business Partners Update
to thank both Cliff and Leslie for 
their steady and generous support 
and for their willingness to include 
Law Center members in their efforts.

      12     Celebrating Twenty Years of Environmental and Community Victories
Helping One Another
by Leslie Lakind, DDS
Lakind Dental Group will donate half 
 the cost of new patient exams to NMELC.
    Every day, we’re asked to 
contribute to this or that progressive 
cause. It would be great if we could 
help every one of them. But the 
reality is we have to make choices: 
The New Mexico Environmental Law 
Center is one of mine.  
    Saving the planet involves 
great paradigm shifts and energy 
of all kinds, especially human 
energy. It’s imperative we think 
globally–and act locally: Buying 
locally contributes to New Mexico’s 
economy and environment.                                        
It preserves local agriculture and 
reduces our carbon footprint. 
Money spent with local business 
circulates in our economy at three 
times the rate of money spent at 
nationally owned businesses. And 
just as patronizing local business 
does three times as much good 
for our community, economically,  
money spent in the local progressive 
business community does the same, 
it circulates in the local progressive 
community.
    When I’m deciding whom to give 
my business or my support to, I keep 
this in mind. The NMELC has a long, 
successful track record of protecting 
our environment. But the Center 
needs funding to continue the vital 
work it does for New Mexicans. 
That’s why Lakind Dental Group 
will donate half the cost of your new 
patient exam to the NMELC. If you’re 
a local progressive, I hope you will 
take us up on this offer. It’s a great 
way to put your money where your 
mouth is.

affect their communities, he knew 
that in practice, public participation 
can be a difficult thing to achieve. 
“Decision-makers have a much 
tougher time dismissing a good 
attorney armed with technical facts 
and legal arguments,” he conceded.  
“In the Flying W case, I was twice 
denied ‘affected interest’ status by 
the BLM.  Only with the positive 
intervention of the Law Center 
was I finally able to participate 
in a proceeding that was, by law, 
supposed to be open to the public.”  
He then went on to say that this 
problem is compounded in poor 
communities where residents are 
perpetually abused by corporations 
and the government. 
    From the Woottens’ experience, 
the Law Center’s highest value is 
opening the door for citizens to 
participate, whether or not they have 
money or political power, and it is 
why Eleanor continues to support 
the Law Center.  The Law Center 
thanks the Wootten family for their 
financial and moral support for the 
past fifteen years.

Brian explains.  “In many instances, 
we would not be able to get a seat 
at the table.  The only way we can 
get real action is by threatening, or 
taking legal action; at that point, 
the polluter will sit down and talk.  
Otherwise, we’d be reliant upon 
best practices and other voluntary 
actions that are really ineffective at 
holding polluters accountable.”

The New Mexico Environmental Law Center is a nonproﬁt, public interest law ﬁrm that provides free and 
low-cost legal services on environmental matters throughout New Mexico.  The mission of the Law Center 
is to protect New Mexico’s environment and communities.  Founded in 1987, the Law Center works with 
clients -- often individuals, neighborhood associations, environmental organizations, Tribes and Pueblos 
-- seeking to protect the environment.  The work of the Law Center is made possible by tax-deductible 
contributions from individuals, businesses and foundations, and by limited earned income.
