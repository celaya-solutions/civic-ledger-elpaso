esidents from all across the 
Galisteo Basin are joining forces 
to protect the fragile watershed 
from the onslaught of oil and gas 
exploration and development.  This 
battle could change New Mexico.  
Tecton Energy LLC from Houston 
has leased minerals from the Rio 
Puerco across the Atrisco lands just 
west of Albuquerque, 
and they have leased 
BLM minerals along 
the Sandoval County 
line.  Hundreds of 
miles of land could be 
threatened.  But the 
battle lines are being 
drawn down on the 
Galisteo Creek, south 
of Santa Fe.
   Tecton has applied 
for three permits from 
the Oil Conservation 
Commission (OCC).  
The permits are in 
egregious locations 
and would violate several provisions 
of present and proposed Santa Fe  
County ordinances.  The construction 
of roads and bulldozing of large 
drilling pads along with the heavy 
truck traffic involved with all 
exploratory drilling would negatively 
impact migratory routes, the vast 
archeological sites, and of course the 
riparian areas north and south of the 
creek.  Two locations are in or near 
the floodplain, and one is on  
the edge of the fragile alluvial 
aquifer.  Homes and water wells  
are also nearby.
   After months of public pressure, 
Governor Richardson returned 
from the presidential campaign trail 
and called for a moratorium.  In 
mid-January he issued an official 
executive order and stopped 
the permitting process for six 
months.   The studies that have been 
demanded by thousands of residents 
are now underway.  The New Mexico 
Oil and Gas Association worked hard 
to prevent the OCC from enacting 
strict environmental protective rules 
covering oil waste disposal.

On February 26, 2008 the  
Santa Fe County Commission 
placed a one year moratorium  
on oil and gas drilling in the 
Galisteo Basin in order to give 
county staff more time to study

and archaeological issues in  
the Basin before completing

Law Center’s Oldest Case
ong-running cases seem to be 
a hallmark of the Law Center, 
with several complex cases having 
spanned more than a decade and 
several more creeping up on their 
tenth anniversaries.  But only one 
has the distinction of being our 
longest-running case.  Is it A, B or C:
A) Our work to prevent the 
expansion of the Southwest 
Landfill in the South Valley of 
Albuquerque.
B) Our representation of Taos 
Pueblo in its efforts to prevent 
the expansion of the Taos 
municipal airport.
C) Our fight against Hydro 
Resources, Inc. in its bid to 
open uranium mines in and 
near the Navajo communities 
of Church Rock and 
Crownpoint?
The answer is B.  Although it is 
not our most highly-publicized case, 
Doug Meiklejohn’s thirteen years as 
counsel to Taos Pueblo marks it as 
the Law Center’s oldest case.  
Gil Suazo, who is a former 
governor of Taos Pueblo, has 
worked on the issue for ten years.  
“Even without the expansion, 
overflights impact the Pueblo,” Gov. 
Suazo explains.  He continues that 
increased airplane traffic would 
threaten the Pueblo’s culture with 
increased noise pollution and visual 
disturbances, and possibly cause 
damage to the tribe’s 600-year-old 
landmark adobe structures.
The current Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) process has 
taken more than fifteen years 
and is not yet finished.  It has 
been a frustrating process for 
Pueblo members, who not only 
have to contend with a drawn-out 
administrative process, but also 
with cultural roadblocks.  “We have 
to try to get people to understand 
the concerns of how the airplanes 
impact the Pueblo,” he says.  “Many 
don’t understand our way of life 
and what we’re talking about.” The 
FAA has generally ignored extensive 
comments provided by the Pueblo, 
even when those comments have 
been prepared with the help of an 
FAA-funded airport expert.  
A good illustration of this, remarks 
Meiklejohn, was a noise analysis 
performed by the FAA several years 
ago.  “The FAA measured the noise of 
an airplane and argued that it should 
not be problematic for the Pueblo 
because it was no louder than a 
thunderclap.  How is someone from 
a traditional society supposed to 
respond to an agency that compares 
a twin-engine Cessna to an act  
of nature?”
Still, Suazo says that the Pueblo 
is thankful for the work of the 
Law Center, and Doug’s role in 
deciphering legal issues and in 
responding to the FAA.  “The agency 
is taking us more seriously now 
– we’re starting to talk with higher-
level officials.  But our success 
remains to be seen.  We always 
remember that the FAA is in the 
airport building business, and our 
job is to protect our way of life.”

aw Center attorneys are 
accustomed to challenging, 
complex cases.  But it is not very 
often that they deal with the truly 
bizarre…like the Red Mutton 
Hunt case.
In 1988, Doug Meiklejohn was 
contacted about a macabre money-
making scheme proposed by a 
leaseholder in the Lincoln National 
Forest.  The leaseholder proposed 
to paint targets on sheep, turn them 
loose on his allotment, and then 
raffle off chances to “hunt” 
the animals. 
The Law Center has not frequently 
argued on behalf of grazing animals 
on public lands.  However, when the 
Forest Service announced the public 
comment period, Doug joined with 
animal protection advocates and 
environmentalists to come to the 
rescue of the beleaguered livestock.  
“After we absorbed the fact that 
there were actually people in the 
world who would pay to shoot a 
painted sheep, we went to work 
figuring out legal strategies,” 
remembers Doug.  “We successfully 
argued that hunting sheep in a 
L
federal  
forest  
was a  
very  
inappro- 
priate use  
of public  
lands,” he says. 
 “We also argued that the raffle  
was illegal because gambling in  
New Mexico was against the law  
at the time.”  The Forest Service 
agreed with the Law Center and  
its allies, and nixed the Red  
Mutton Hunt scheme.
This issue marks the second of four Green Fire Reports that will celebrate the Law Center’s twentieth anniversary over the next year. As part 
of that celebration, we are happy to share Twenty Years | Twenty Stories, which will focus on the clients, volunteers, staff members, donors, and 
victories that have seen the Law Center from its earliest days to the present.

First Donor
he Law Center has grown 
into one of New Mexico’s 
most respected environmental 
organizations, with hundreds of 
supportive members, dozens of cases 
under its belt, and a crack legal team.  
And it all started with a $25 check.
That check came from our first 
donor, Lynda Taylor.  Lynda is a 
nationally-recognized activist and 
policy advocate who worked at the 
Southwest Research and Information 
Center at the time.  
“I didn’t have much money  
to give, but I was so happy that  
Doug Meiklejohn was getting 
attorneys together.  Working with 
vulnerable communities that were 
in the down-and-dirty fights with 
polluters and regulators, I realized     
  that they needed 
lawyers dedicated 
for fighting  
on their behalf.  
That check was  
my way of  
showing my commitment to  
the Law Center’s cause.”  
One of those communities was 
Sunland Park, where residents 
enlisted Lynda and the Law Center 
in their fight against a medical waste 
incinerator and a landfill (please 
see Fall 2007 issue of the Green Fire 
Report for more information on this 
case).  “The incinerator company 
never in a million years thought we 
could shut it down.  But we had the 
right mix of people at the right time.  
We stopped it dead in its tracks,” she 
remembers.  It was just one occasion 
when she saw her early investment  
in a tiny non-profit law 
office pay off.  
Since that time, she has been an 
invaluable supporter of the Law 
Center.  Before the Law Center 
could afford to hire a Development 
Director, Lynda helped the staff 
to identify foundations that 
would be likely to fund its work. 
Later she joined the Law Center’s 
Development Committee to help 
increase individual gifts to the 
organization.  Lynda, her husband 
Robert Haspel, and their children 
hosted our annual event in 2000, 
and played host again for our 20th 
Anniversary Kick Off Event in Santa 
Fe. The Law Center awarded Lynda 
with the Community Environmental 
Advocacy Award in 1999.
The Law Center thanks Lynda and 
her family for their tremendous 
support of our work over 
the past twenty years!

         ogether, we’ve   
         taken on the fights 
that no one else would 
take on,” explains Robby 
Rodriguez, Director of the 
SouthWest Organizing 
Project (SWOP), one of 
the country’s leading 
advocates for social justice 
and a long-time Law 
Center ally and client.
   “No one else that I know 
of would have taken on 
Intel, one of the biggest 
corporations in the world, 
and a darling of New 
Mexico’s state government.
   “But SWOP, the Law 
Center and Corrales 
Residents for Clean Air and 
Water were too concerned about 
the health of local residents and the 
protection of our water resources 
to shy away from that David-and-
Goliath fight.”
   Rodriguez is referring to the 
Law Center’s representation of 
SWOP in two proceedings against 
the multinational computer chip 
manufacturer.  One involved the 
company’s attempt to purchase 
water rights from southern New 
Mexico while the other was a long-
standing fight to force the plant to 
clean up its toxic air emissions.  In 
the former case, Law Center Staff 
Attorney Doug Wolf represented 
SWOP in a victorious effort to 
prevent the company 
from purchasing 
$1.5 million in 
water rights from farmers near 
Socorro.  The ruling stymied the 
company’s attempt to use the 
rights to offset 4 million gallons of 
groundwater used at the Rio Rancho 
plant every day. 
   Unfortunately, SWOP and the 
Law Center were not so successful 
in forcing the company to clean up 
its air emissions.  But Rodriguez, 
who cut his teeth as a college intern 
working for SWOP at the Intel 
hearings, maintains that taking on 
the fight was important in its own 
right.  “It’s important to win these 
battles because human health and 
the health of the environment are 
at stake.  But it’s also about giving 
communities the power to go into 
these battles against 
the government and 
giant companies.

impossible – to go into

services, we would not be

   The Law Center first 
started working with 
SWOP in 1990 on the 
Sunland Park incinerator 
case, and since that time 
has worked closely with

hile the Law Center has had 
many tremendously talented 
and passionate individuals serve on 
its Board, it has had only one bona 
fide “Living Treasure” serve at its 
helm:  Edith (Edie) Pierpont.  Edie 
was named a “Treasure” by the 
Network for the Common Good in 
1991 because of her tireless work 
for New Mexico’s environment, 
including a stint as the Law Center’s 
first Board President.
For nearly two decades, Edie 
was a force to be reckoned with at 
the State Legislature, where she 
was a close ally of the Law Center, 
lobbying on behalf of the New 
Mexico League of Women Voters on 
land use, water, hazardous waste 
and nuclear waste issues.  
She smiles when remembering 
the “many, many hearings” that she 
sat through with Doug Meiklejohn 
over the years, having worked 
closely with him on many legislative 
initiatives, including the successful 
efforts to gain passage of the land-
mark Solid Waste Act of 1990 and 
the New Mexico Mining Act of 1993.
“The Law Center was a much 
needed force that could take on  
cases against environmental threats,” 
she remembers when asked why 
she supported the Law Center in its 
early days.  “Doug and his staff gave 
real teeth to the environmentalists 
working to protect our land  
and water.”
While she has retired from much 
of her volunteer work, Edie is still  
as passionate about saving the earth. 
With a view out her kitchen window 
of the Galisteo Basin (see page 1),  
she cites water protection, land use 
and global warming as the issues 
that should be foremost in the  
minds of today’s  
environmentalists.  
The Law Center

her two decades  
of support and  
guidance.

Without attorneys it 
would be tremendously 
difficult – and sometimes 
impossible – to go into

make sure that the voices 
of affected residents are

as effective as we are.
   The Law Center first 
started working with 
SWOP in 1990 on the 
Sunland Park incinerator

has worked closely with 
the organizing group. 
In addition to Intel, Law

represented SWOP efforts to prevent 
the expansion of the Southwest

Universe Boulevard in Albuquerque, 
to negotiate for environmental 
improvements by  
the Stericycle

hile the Law Center has had 
many tremendously talented 
and passionate individuals serve on 
its Board, it has had only one bona 
fide “Living Treasure” serve at its 
helm:  Edith (Edie) Pierpont.  Edie 
was named a “Treasure” by the 
Network for the Common Good in 
1991 because of her tireless work 
for New Mexico’s environment, 
including a stint as the Law Center’s 
first Board President.
For nearly two decades, Edie 
was a force to be reckoned with at 
the State Legislature, where she 
was a close ally of the Law Center, 
lobbying on behalf of the New 
Mexico League of Women Voters on 
land use, water, hazardous waste 
and nuclear waste issues.  
She smiles when remembering 
the “many, many hearings” that she 
sat through with Doug Meiklejohn 
over the years, having worked 
closely with him on many legislative 
initiatives, including the successful 
efforts to gain passage of the land-
mark Solid Waste Act of 1990 and 
the New Mexico Mining Act of 1993.
“The Law Center was a much 
needed force that could take on  
cases against environmental threats,” 
she remembers when asked why 
she supported the Law Center in its 
early days.  “Doug and his staff gave 
real teeth to the environmentalists 
working to protect our land  
and water.”
While she has retired from much 
of her volunteer work, Edie is still  
as passionate about saving the earth. 
With a view out her kitchen window 
of the Galisteo Basin (see page 1),  
she cites water protection, land use 
and global warming as the issues 
that should be foremost in the  
minds of today’s  
environmentalists.  
The Law Center  
thanks Edie for  
her two decades  
of support and  
guidance.

he Law Center won in its appeal 
on behalf of Clovis’ Hispanic, 
African-American and low-income 
residents against the proposed 110 
million gallon per year ethanol 
plant that would be sited near their 
residential neighborhoods.  In 
2007, the New Mexico Environment 
Department (NMED) issued an air 
permit for the plant even though 
residents were very concerned about 
the possible respiratory illnesses 
that might be caused by the plant’s 
air emissions and the diesel exhaust 
from thousands of delivery trucks 
and trains annually, as well as other 
adverse impacts like noise, odor, 
traffic, and dust. 
Celebrating T wenty Years of Environmental and Community Victories  nmenvirolaw.org     7
Representing our clients in 
an appeal to the Environmental 
Improvement Board, we argued 
that the company’s notice to the 
community about the location of 
the plant had been substantially 
flawed.  Based on our arguments, 
the Environmental Improvement 
Board reversed the NMED’s decision 
to issue the permit and required 
NMED to conduct another public 
hearing following proper notice. The 
Law Center was prepared to refute 
NMED’s assertion that it must make 
permitting decisions based solely on 
technical air emission data; rather, 
we intended to argue that the agency 
must seriously consider all of the 
Citizens Take on ConAgra Ethanol  Plant
adverse disparate impacts that the 
plant will have on Clovis’ minority 
populations, not just air emissions.
In the face of this additional 
hearing, which could be followed by 
additional appeals, ConAgra decided 
on January 22, 2008 to withdraw its 
permit application for the ethanol 
plant.  This is a big win for Clovis 
residents. Nevertheless, the Law 
Center may still seek to challenge 
ConAgra’s existing air permit for 
its grain elevator, which was also 
obtained following a misleading 
notice and which inflicts excessive 
levels of noise, odor, and dust on 
nearby residents.

Oil Pit Rule the Pits for Industry
by Eric Jantz
fter consideration of Task Force 
recommendations, the NM Oil 
Conservation Division has issued draft 
regulations on oil and gas waste pits, 
which are pits dug into the ground 
that collect solid and liquid wastes 
produced during oil and gas drilling. 
The draft regulations significantly 
strengthen public safety and 
environmental requirements of these 
waste pits by requiring oil and gas 
companies to have liners for all pits.  
Currently, not all pits are required to 
have liners – oil and gas companies 
can essentially just dump their toxic 
wastes into a hole in the ground 
and then cover it up. In addition, 
the regulations would require 
companies to take their wastes to a 
certified landfill, and encourage the 
use of “closed loop” drilling systems, 
which effectively re-use many of the 
materials that would otherwise wind 
up in waste pits.
   A hearing was held on the proposed 
regulations, and the Law Center 
presented extensive health and 
economic testimony on behalf of its 
client, the Oil & Gas Accountability 
Project (OGAP).  An internationally-
known environmental health expert, 
Dr. Theo Colborn, testified about 
the kinds of chemicals that end up 
in these pits.  Dr. Colborn pointed 
out that most of the chemicals in 
pits are highly dangerous, including 
chemicals that cause cancer, liver 
damage, and neurological damage.  
Dr. Colborn also testified about the 
potential for oil and gas pit chemicals 
to be endocrine disruptors, which 
interfere with hormones and can lead 
to developmental problems both  
within a person’s lifetime and 
generations later.
   The Law Center also presented 
testimony from Mary Ellen Denomy, 
a Certified Petroleum Accountant who 
testified about the possible economic 
impacts on oil and gas companies.  
Ms. Denomy concluded, based on her 
experience representing oil and gas 
operators and county governments  
in Colorado and New Mexico, that  
the proposed regulations would, at 
worst, increase oil and gas waste 
disposal costs by about 6%.  Using 
closed loop systems would actually 
save operators money.
   Even testimony by the oil and gas 
industry confirmed that at most, the 
new rule would impose a 10% increase 
in waste disposal costs and at most a 
5% decrease in returns on investment.  
This is a small imposition on an 
industry that is making record profits 
and is responsible for substantial 
contamination to groundwater  
and soil.

ew Mexico’s Rio Grande Rift 
is an international treasure 
deserving of the highest protection. 
Home to several Pueblo Nations, 
Santa Fe, the Galisteo Basin, the 
Ortiz and San Pedro Mountains, 
the area is one of the state’s most 
ecologically and culturally diverse 
regions. It is a vital resource to 
farmers, ranchers, students and 
educators, businesspeople, artists, 
spiritual and religious leaders, 
sportsmen, outdoor enthusiasts, 
and community and conservation 
groups. In accord with inherent 
beauty, ecological value, and 
authority of Santa Fe County, we 
believe the following:
1. The watersheds of the 
Galisteo Basin are of 
paramount value and its 
waters the lifeblood of the 
land’s wildlife and our 
healthy communities;
2. The Galisteo Basin is a vital 
resource to a sustainable

< Galisteo Basin Story from page 1
   Counties can zone polluting 
industries out of watersheds and 
away from rural residential areas.  
Now that the easy money has been 
made in oil and gas development 
in New Mexico, it is imperative that 
citizens work to strengthen County 
and State protections to prevent the 
devastation from this final run at the 
most marginal areas for oil and gas 
exploitation.
   It is time to make tough decisions 
about protection of air and water 
and find new ways to fund the 
public schools as the old wealth 
of the Permian Basin is rapidly 
diminishing.  In another twenty 
years, the San Juan Basin will also 
be depleted.  If there are fortunes to 
be made by out of state oil and gas 
companies plundering the Galisteo 
watershed or other areas along the 
vast Albuquerque Rift, then that 
recovery must be done with the 
strictest of protections.
   The one old well down in the 
Galisteo creekbed that has produced 
sporadically over the last 23 years is 
a dismal failure.  In spite of months 
of efforts with the supposed “new 
technologies,” and thousands of 
barrels of Santa Fe County drinking 
water and thousands of gallons of 
Schlumberger frac’ing chemicals 
forced into that tight formation,  
only a few dozen barrels of oil have 
been produced.   Unfortunately 
Black-Ferrill #1 is a sad testament  
to how speculative and wasteful 
these last marginal plays can be.   
In late January, Tecton officially  
filed for temporary abandonment  
of the well.
   There was natural gas found  
back in the 1980’s.  However, a  
marginally productive gas field 
with a maze of collection lines 
and pipelines with all of the 
noxious pollution and fire danger 
that accompanies natural gas 
development would be a death blow 
to the wildlife, the water, the air, and 
the vibrant and unique communities 
of the Galisteo Basin.
   Citizens must demand the strictest 
of environmental protections as 
industry fights back against every 
County or State initiative to protect 
the health of residents, wildlife, and 
our dwindling water resources.
At a public meeting held by 
Tecton Energy on October 4, 
the company’s CEO stated that

ew Mexico’s Rio Grande Rift 
is an international treasure 
deserving of the highest protection. 
Home to several Pueblo Nations, 
Santa Fe, the Galisteo Basin, the 
Ortiz and San Pedro Mountains, 
the area is one of the state’s most 
ecologically and culturally diverse 
regions. It is a vital resource to 
farmers, ranchers, students and 
educators, businesspeople, artists, 
spiritual and religious leaders, 
sportsmen, outdoor enthusiasts, 
and community and conservation 
groups. In accord with inherent 
beauty, ecological value, and 
authority of Santa Fe County, we 
believe the following:
1. The watersheds of the 
Galisteo Basin are of 
paramount value and its 
waters the lifeblood of the 
land’s wildlife and our 
healthy communities;
2. The Galisteo Basin is a vital 
resource to a sustainable 
future for central New 
Mexico’s cultural, rural and 
agricultural communities;
3. The Galisteo Basin provides 
unique recreational and 
sporting opportunities 
for families, hunters, 
anglers, and other outdoor 
enthusiasts;

5. The Galisteo Basin should 
be protected for the benefit 
of the people – all of the 
people.
Based on these values, we believe 
that it is a grave mistake to exploit 
these special lands for the principal 
benefit of the fossil fuel industry. 
Oil and gas development poses 
fundamental threats to the water, 
wildlife and cultural values of 
the Galisteo Basin as well as to 
the public health of communities 
throughout the region. Therefore all 
steps must be taken to prevent and 
reduce the impact caused by energy 
development. The region should be 
protected for the benefit of present 
and future generations.
The Coalition for Energy 
Accountability is an alliance  
of businesses, non-profits and 
individuals fighting to protect the 
Galisteo Basin from oil and gas 
production. The Law Center  
represents Drilling Santa Fe,

For Galisteo Drilling 
Donations: The

Drilling Santa Fe against the 
proposed oil and gas drilling 
in the Galisteo Basin.

Environmental Law Center
< Galisteo Basin Story from page 1
   Counties can zone polluting 
industries out of watersheds and 
away from rural residential areas.  
Now that the easy money has been 
made in oil and gas development 
in New Mexico, it is imperative that 
citizens work to strengthen County 
and State protections to prevent the 
devastation from this final run at the 
most marginal areas for oil and gas 
exploitation.
   It is time to make tough decisions 
about protection of air and water 
and find new ways to fund the 
public schools as the old wealth 
of the Permian Basin is rapidly 
diminishing.  In another twenty 
years, the San Juan Basin will also 
be depleted.  If there are fortunes to 
be made by out of state oil and gas 
companies plundering the Galisteo 
watershed or other areas along the 
vast Albuquerque Rift, then that 
recovery must be done with the 
strictest of protections.
   The one old well down in the 
Galisteo creekbed that has produced 
sporadically over the last 23 years is 
a dismal failure.  In spite of months 
of efforts with the supposed “new 
technologies,” and thousands of 
barrels of Santa Fe County drinking 
water and thousands of gallons of 
Schlumberger frac’ing chemicals 
forced into that tight formation,  
only a few dozen barrels of oil have 
been produced.   Unfortunately 
Black-Ferrill #1 is a sad testament  
to how speculative and wasteful 
these last marginal plays can be.   
In late January, Tecton officially  
filed for temporary abandonment  
of the well.
   There was natural gas found  
back in the 1980’s.  However, a  
marginally productive gas field 
with a maze of collection lines 
and pipelines with all of the 
noxious pollution and fire danger 
that accompanies natural gas 
development would be a death blow 
to the wildlife, the water, the air, and 
the vibrant and unique communities 
of the Galisteo Basin.
   Citizens must demand the strictest 
of environmental protections as 
industry fights back against every 
County or State initiative to protect 
the health of residents, wildlife, and 
our dwindling water resources.
At a public meeting held by 
Tecton Energy on October 4, 
the company’s CEO stated that 
his company believes there are 
between 50 and 100 million barrels 
of light sweet crude oil and 5 to 10 
trillion cubic feet of natural gas 
along the Albuquerque Rift between 
the San Juan Basin and Socorro.  
The Houston-based company 
currently plans to drill eight 
exploratory wells, perhaps more, 
on the 65,000 acres between the 
villages of Galisteo and Cerrillos, 
where it has leased minerals.

we will be going on the road, visiting towns across New Mexico and celebrating our many 
victories along the way. Please join us in Roswell, Silver City, Las Cruces, Gallup, and Taos.
he Law Center is pleased 
to announce the addition of 
two new Board members .  Myron 
Armijo, who joined the Board in 
October, is a former Governor of 
Santa Ana Pueblo who currently is the 
T ribal Liaison in the State Engineers 
Office .  Myron brings very important 
experience to our board as a Pueblo 
leader, and as an ardent supporter of 
conservation of New Mexico’s most 
precious natural resource – water .  
Stuart Bluestone also joined the 
Board in October, and served as New 
Mexico’s Chief Deputy Attorney 
General from 1999-2007 . He has 
served as Director of the Civil and 
Consumer Protection Divisions for 
previous Attorneys General and 
currently serves as Attorney General 
Gary King’s Senior Counsel . Please 
join us in welcoming Myron and Stuart 
to our Board of Directors .
   The youngest member to join the 
Law Center is Meredith (Maggie) 
Clark who was born in November 
to the Law Center’s Development 
Officer Shelbie Knox and her husband 
David Clark . Welcome Maggie!
   The Law Center bids farewell to 
four valuable members of its team .  
We wish them all the best of luck in 
their future endeavors .  
   The Law Center announces the 
departure of Sarah Piltch, who 
served as a Staff Attorney for two 
and a half years . Sarah was an 
important member of the legal team, 
achieving several important strategic 
accomplishments for New Mexico 
communities . She served as lead 
counsel on the Vulcan concrete batch 
plant case in Bernalillo County, which 
marked the first appeal ever brought 
to the Bernalillo County Air Quality 
Control Board . The appeal incited the 
board to change its regulations allowing 
for more community involvement in 
their decisions . She initially led our 
representation of clients in Clovis who 
prevented the siting of an ethanol 
plant next to African-American and 
Hispanic communities .  Sarah was also 
an important part of the legal team on 
the Paseo del Norte extension case and, 
most recently, the Crownpoint-Church 
Rock uranium case . 
   We first met Richard Deertrack in 
1994 when he represented Taos Pueblo 
in its fight to prevent the expansion 
Welcomes and Farewells
T
of the Taos airport .  Shortly after 
he joined our Board of Directors 
in 1997, Richard explained, “Many 
Indian tribes…don’t feel they can 
have an effect on environmental 
issues…because they don’t understand 
the legal processes .  This is where 
the Law Center – which has people 
who are dedicated and who know the 
process, who are experts and know 
the language – is so important to Indian 
tribes and other communities .”  During 
his tenure, including four years as the 
President of the Board, he contributed 
to our work through his deep grasp of 
the environmental issues facing Native 
American communities and his quiet, 
introspective leadership .
   The Law Center would like to thank 
Joe Clarke for his service on our 
Board of Directors, including two 
years as co-Chair of our Development 
Committee .  When he joined our 
Board in 2003, he brought to our table 
his significant knowledge as an attorney 
specializing in water issues and his 
passion to protect the environment of 
New Mexico .
   And we would like to thank Sue 
Chappell, Board T reasurer from  
2005 to October 2007, for her 
invaluable service to the Law Center 
over the past nine years .  When Sue 
came to the Law Center in 1998, her 
experience as a community activist  
and practicing attorney with Sutin, 
Thayer & Browne added important 
insights to Board deliberations over
