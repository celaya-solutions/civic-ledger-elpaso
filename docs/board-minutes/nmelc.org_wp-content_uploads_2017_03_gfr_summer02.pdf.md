A
few years back a candidate for city council (the
person and town shall remain anonymous) asked
me, "well, why is sprawl so bad?"  After I regained my
composure I began my reply , "The consequences
associated with sprawl are enormous—loss of open
space and wildlife habitat, longer commutes to work
and school, increased pollution, disinvestment in our
downtowns and older neighborhoods, higher taxes to
pay for new infrastructure and urban services in out-
lying areas, neglect of existing infrastructure to pay
for new roads and utility lines, and the list goes on."
"Oh, now I get it," this person replied.
Unfortunately , not many people do—at least
those in the develop-
ment community and
political arena whose
idea of progress is
growth anywhere, at
any cost. It's a tough
battle to fight sprawl.
Zoning codes, finan-
cial lending practices,
and established plan-
ning principles all
contribute to sprawl.
SOME URBAN
PLANNING
HISTORY
Throughout time humans
have tended to band
closely together in their
living situations. Originally this was for defensive
purposes but later when defense was no longer a
major issue, people still lived in close proximity to one
another as well as to the services they needed for their
daily needs.
In the late 19th century during the height of the
Industrial Revolution, problems began to arise with
this traditional way of living. Factories and other pol-
lution creating businesses began to locate in or near
residential areas. T o counter this situation, zoning was
created. But as time progressed things got out of
hand. Most commercial businesses were excluded
from residential areas, even those that were reason-
able and necessary—like neighborhood groceries and
drugstores. Soon every use had its own zone.
After W orld W ar II the first large-scale subdivi-
sions began to appear on the landscape, and caused
our cities to sprawl like never before. The advent of
the interstate highway system caused our cities to
increase even more. Now people were able to flee the
inner cities and find the supposed American dream in
the suburbs.
But over the last decade, people have begun to
question if this is really the way they want to live.
Commuters are stuck in their cars longer and longer
each year. A person
has to drive to get a
loaf of bread or a gal-
lon of milk. Children
need rides for almost
all their needs. At one
time, most children
walked or biked to
school. This is now the
exception rather than
the rule, as schools
have been built farther
and farther outside
urban areas. And
in the process of grow-
ing exponentially , we
have caused more and
more of our rural land-
scapes to fall under the
path of   the bulldozer, displacing wildlife and scar-
ring our hillsides.
GROWTH MANAGEMENT
So what can be done about sprawl? A whole new
field called "growth management" or "smart growth"
has developed over the last decade or so. Urban plan-
ners, elected officials and enlightened builders are
finally realizing that we cannot continue to grow like
we have over the last fifty years. People don't want to
be stuck in their cars for hours each day . They want
more of an urban life—

HRI
T
he litigation before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission administra-
tive law judge continues to be held in abeyance while the parties
attempt to negotiate a settlement agreement. Although at this time the
parties continue to negotiate, ENDAUM is using other avenues to active-
ly oppose any uranium mining in its communities.  
In late May, ENDAUM was able to convince the President and Vice
President of the Navajo Nation to support those communities within the
Navajo Nation that oppose uranium mining. In a letter dated May 22,
2002 to all Chapter Presidents and Navajo Nation Council delegates from
chapters that passed resolutions opposing HRI's uranium mining projects
in Crownpoint and Churchrock, the President and Vice President pledged
the Executive Branch's support to those communities in their opposition
to uranium mining. ENDAUM and the communities that will be
affected by HRI's proposed mines welcomed this unprecedented support. 
In addition to earning the support of the Executive Branch of the Navajo
Nation, ENDAUM has discovered that the uranium subsidy amendments
to the Energy Bill originally offered by Domenici and Wilson have resur-
faced in the Energy Bill passed by the Senate, in a nominally different
form. This is despite the fact that ENDAUM had been assured that the
amendment had been withdrawn. The community has begun to organize
opposition to this provision and is asking Senator Jeff Bingaman to kill
this dangerous provision in conference committee.

US 70 HIGHWAY EXPANSION
F
our days after the comment period on the Final Environmental
Impact Statement for the US 70 Milepost 302 to Ruidoso Downs
project ended, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a
Record of Decision (ROD)
and signed a contract for the
construction of a four lane
highway through the Hondo
V alley. The cultural resources
report outlining historic
properties that may be
impacted by the project was,
and remains, incomplete.
Our client, the V alley
Community Preservation
Commission (VCPC) is
coordinating its efforts
against the expansion of
US Highway 70 between
Milepost 302 (two miles east
of Riverside, New Mexico)
and Ruidoso Downs with the
New Mexico Heritage
Preservation Alliance and
the National T rust for
Historic Preservation. 
Although the FHWA
and the New Mexico State
Highway and T ransportation
Department (NMSHTD) are
currently discussing what to
do when the project reaches
known or undiscovered historical properties that will be impacted by the
project with the various interested parties, the VCPC is concerned that
these conciliatory efforts are not adequate. The process (programmatic
agreement) only allows for public input on properties discovered in the
future. The cultural resources studies completed prior to the date of the
programmatic agreement discussions—without public input—will not be
open for review. The NMSHTD and the FHWA are still researching
newly discovered historical resources in the valley .

INTEL AIR
C
omputer chip giant Intel Corporation continues to expand on the
Rio Rancho mesa.  However, a recent court room showdown could
lead to new pollution lim-
its on the plant, and give
the public more involve-
ment in future decisions
about the company . On
March 18, Law Center
attorney Doug W olf pre-
sented oral argument in
front of the New Mexico
Court of Appeals. The
appeal, on behalf of
the SouthW est Organizing
Project (SWOP), i nvolves
the air permit issued to
Intel by the New Mexico
Environment Department
(NMED) in 2000. In
its appeal, SWOP argues
that it did not receive
a  fair hearing from the
New Mexico Environmental
Improvement Board and that Intel needs to obtain an operating permit
for its air pollution. Such a permit could subject Intel to additional
ponds, build an additional tailings pond, remove the berm
between two of the existing tailings ponds, and construct a hydro-
carbon land farm. 
Picuris Pueblo and V ecinos del Rio are concerned about ON's
most recent application proposal because of its groundwater and
air permit violations. Since Franklin Industries, Inc.'s (ON's pred-
ecessor) application to increase discharge to the tailings ponds at
the mill site in 1998, the quality of the groundwater beneath the
facility has steadily declined. ON is now in violation of several
groundwater quality standards. In addition, of all the tailings
ponds proposed, only one will be lined. These proposals do not
adequately protect the groundwater in the areas surrounding
the site.
While this application has not yet been scheduled for a hear-
ing, Picuris Pueblo and V ecinos del Rio are working with two
experts and communicating with the Groundwater Quality
Bureau to address these concerns.

STERICYCLE, INC.
T
he international medical waste treatment corporation,
Stericycle, Inc., unwittingly awakened a sleeping giant in the
W ells Park neighborhood of Albuquerque in April. Stericycle
sought to amend its solid waste treatment permit to allow it to sig-
nificantly change its current operations at its medical waste treat-
ment facility near downtown Albuquerque. Currently, Stericycle is
permitted to treat medical waste using a
chlorine treatment method.  However, the
Albuquerque facility has been used only as
a medical waste transfer station for the past
year.  
After reviewing Stericycle's application
for permit modification that it filed
with the New Mexico Environment
Department's Solid W aste Bureau (SWB),
it became apparent that Stericycle's pro-
posed modifications—substantially recon-
structing large portions of the physical
facility, nearly quadrupling the amount of
medical waste to be processed, and increas-
ing hours of operation to allow the facility
to operate twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week—amount to a complete-
ly new operation. 
The W ells Park Neighborhood
Association, along with the Southwest
Organizing Project (SWOP) decided to
challenge Stericycle's application. 
W ells Park and SWOP were also con-
cerned about Stericycle's abysmal record of
operation in other states, and its poor envi-
ronmental and safety record during the four
years that Stericycle has operated the facili-
ty in Albuquerque. (Read more details
about Stericycle's record and the hearing on
our website at www.nmenvirolaw.org) 
Stericycle, the SWB, and the Law
Center's clients submitted their closing
arguments to the hearing officer in late
June and are waiting on her recommenda-
tions. Stay tuned.

CHINO SECOND HEARING
On February 25, 2002, a hearing officer for the New Mexico
Environment Department (NMED) began a second hearing
on the mine closure plan for the Phelps Dodge Chino mine.
The hearing was to take testimony on the permit proposed as
the result of (initially secret) negotiations between NMED,
Phelps Dodge, and the state Energy, Minerals and Natural
Resources Department (EMNRD). The testimony made clear
that the stipulated permit was an outcome negotiated over
the heads of the NMED staffers who know the most about
the heavily polluted Chino mine. 
The Law Center is representing the Gila Resources
Information Project (GRIP). GRIP's expert witness, Jim
Kuipers of the Center for Science in Public Participation
(CSPP), challenged the per-
mit as lacking in details and
in scientific support and
asserted the merits of the
comprehensive closure plan
already proposed by GRIP .
Post-hearing briefs were
filed in June and a decision
is expected in August or
September.
TYRONE HEARING
On May 20, the hotly con-
tested Phelps Dodge T yrone
mine closure hearing began
and lasted a full two weeks.
Phelps Dodge and NMED
are at odds and have pro-
posed dramatically different
closure plans for the site. GRIP , again represented by the Law
Center and CSPP , has proposed a comprehensive closure
plan for the site that would best protect the environment. 
Although Phelps Dodge's plan would leave large portions
of the site unreclaimed, the company did surprise GRIP and
NMED by announcing a new, innovative water treatment
scheme for the mine cleanup. The proposal, which has

environmental performance standards. The judges told the packed
court room they were taking the matter under advisement; a decision is
expected soon.
Outside of the courtroom, support is building for off-site air moni-
tors that would measure pollution from the Intel plant in homes down-
wind in nearby Corrales. Not only has this been endorsed by the
Corrales Mayor and the Sandoval County Commission, but NMED has
requested funds from EPA to install such monitors. SWOP members
and Corrales residents have also been taking matters into their own
essentially been accepted by GRIP and cautiously praised by
NMED, would treat contaminated water from the site to meet
the stringent New Mexico groundwater quality standards.
Also, unlike the Phelps Dodge/NMED permit for the Chino
mine, the T yrone scheme would not waste any scarce potable
water to dilute polluted water from the mine. Phelps Dodge
proposed this plan apparently in response to a media cam-
paign mounted by GRIP that challenged the sheer waste of
the Chino water treatment plan. We hope that Phelps Dodge's
willingness to respond to environmental concerns with a supe-
rior innovative plan for water treatment is a sign of things
to come.
Post-hearing briefs will be filed by the end of August and
a decision is expected in October or November.
MINING ACT PETITION
As these updates may make
clear, the effort to establish
mine reclamation plans for
the Phelps Dodge mines has
focused on lawyers and hear-
ings, with reclamation sci-
ence taking a back seat. In
an effort to establish science
as the guiding force in clean-
ing up these large mines --
GRIP , Phelps Dodge,
EMNRD, and a pro-mining
group from Grant County are
proposing a new process. In
exchange for an extension of
the current New Mexico
deadline for mine reclama-
tion plans, companies like
Phelps Dodge would pledge interim financial assurance to the
state and fund a panel or panels of neutral scientific experts
who would try to ensure that good science would shape the
ultimate reclamation plans. The New Mexico Mining
Commission will consider this proposal during a hearing in
August.

hands. A “bucket brigade,” using simple but effective technology has
been collecting grab samples of air down-wind of the Intel plant.
The results indicate that Intel's chemicals are reaching Corrales
homes and include some that may not be authorized by Intel's per-
mit. Finally, Corrales Citizens for Clean Air and Water, a communi-
ty group that is working closely with SWOP and the Law Center will
soon release a community health survey that is expected to link Intel
emissions to health problems in Corrales.

CASE UPDATES

SOURCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL BATTLES: LESSONS FROM THE LAW CENTER’S FIRST 15 YEARS
I
n its first 15 years, the Law Center has been involved in a wide range
of matters, including such diverse issues as disposal of solid and other
wastes, growth, mining, and grazing and logging on public lands.
Despite this wide variety of issues, three consistent themes have
emerged from all of these matters. 
1)  PEOPLE FIGHT TO PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES 
AND THEIR COMMUNITIES.
The Law Center's experience is that the vast majority of environmental
battles are fought by local people whose communities are threatened by
adverse environmental consequences of existing or proposed facilities
and operations. Below are just a few examples. 
/c5411  Residents of Sunland Park formed Concerned Citizens of Sunland Park
and succeeded in closing a medical waste incinerator that was emitting
contamination into the Sunland Park community .  
/c5411  Members of the South V alley Coalition of Neighborhood Associations
and the Isleta Pueblo have worked together to try to prevent the
adverse environmental impacts that would result from expansion of
the Southwest landfill in Albuquerque's South V alley and changing
the landfill's status so that it can accept municipal solid waste.
/c5411Residents of Crownpoint and Church Rock formed the Eastern Navajo
Diné Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM) and have worked to pre-
vent the proposed mining of uranium that would contaminate their
sole source of drinking water.
/c5411  The Picuris Pueblo is fighting on several fronts to stop the mining of
mica that is destroying the ability of Pueblo members to make the
pottery that is crucial to their culture and economy . 
2)  ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION MOST 
OFTEN AFFECTS MINORITY AND 
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES.
Almost all of the Law Center's current cases involve situations in which
communities are working either to address existing contamination or to
prevent degradation of their environments. Approximately 85% of this
work is for minority and low-income communities. This is well illustrat-
ed by the examples of our community work outlined above: 
/c5411 Almost all of the citizens of Sunland Park are Mexican-American.
/c5411  The members of ENDAUM and the Picuris Pueblo are Native Americans.
/c5411  Approximately 70% of the residents of the South V alley are Hispanic,
and 99% of the residents of the Isleta Pueblo are Native American.
Moreover, these examples are typical. Facilities that have the potential
to pollute are much more likely to be located in low income and minor-
ity communities for two reasons. First, those communities rarely have
the resources and political clout to prevent that from happening.
Second, communities that do have political clout are better able to per-
suade industry to locate elsewhere and influence government agencies to
prevent the siting of polluting industries in their neighborhoods.
The disparity in treatment of communities extends as well to the
cleanup of pollution that has already occurred. Existing contamination
is much more likely to be cleaned up in a timely and thorough manner
if it exists in non-minority communities.
NMELC FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY 1987 - 2002 — 5
3)  COMMUNITIES MUST OFTEN FIGHT NOT 
ONLY INDUSTRY BUT GOVERNMENT 
REGULATORS AS WELL.  
One of the unfortunate lessons learned by the Law Center during the
past 15 years is that communities that are working to protect their
environments are likely to be opposed not only by polluting industries
but also by the government agencies that are charged with regulating
those industries. 
A clear example of this phenomenon has been the consistent advo-
cacy for ISL uranium mining in the Crownpoint area demonstrated by
the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the NRC). In a
conversation concerning a pending issue in the case, one of the staff's
attorneys told a Law Center attorney that the staff needed to check
with the mining company before it could determine what its position
would be.
Regrettably , the posture of the NRC staff is not atypical. Many of
the Bureaus of the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED)
seem all too anxious to provide industry with whatever it wants. A
waste disposal consultant once pointed out to a Law Center attorney
that dealing with the Solid W aste Bureau of the NMED was no longer
a challenge because the Bureau always gave the consultant what his
clients wanted. 
There are exceptions to this rule, of course. The most notable in the
experience of the Law Center is the Ground W ater Bureau of the
NMED. The personnel in that Bureau act independently and do not
always agree either with industry or with those aligned against indus-
try. But that Bureau is truly an exception.
This final lesson learned by the Law Center during the past 15 years
has serious implications for those working to protect the environment.
It means that groups and individuals working to protect their families
and their communities must spend as much time and effort fighting
their own representatives in government, as they spend fighting the
industries that threaten their environments. It also means that pro-
ceedings conducted by those governmental representatives are usually
stacked in favor of the industries involved and against the participating
community and environmental groups.
THE LAW CENTER WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT
COMMUNITIES WORKING TO PROTECT 
THEIR ENVIRONMENTS.
The work of the Law Center is community based. W e represent com-
munities to help them achieve the protection that they want for their
environments. W e also will work to change the factors that cause envi-
ronmental injustice and that lead government agencies to advocate for
the industries that they regulate. W e look forward to involving the Law
Center's supporters and allies in these struggles.

FROM THE DIRECTOR

O
nce again summer knocked at
our door, and at the Law
Center that means we were fortu-
nate to host summer interns.
This year, we had two students
who had little in common except
that they were both doing great
work for us and the people of
New Mexico.
Lucrecia Jaramillogrew up in
Espanola, and so is very familiar
with the environmental problems
that haunt New Mexico. "W ater is
obviously the most important issue
in New Mexico right now," she
mentioned. "It's especially interest-
ing, and difficult, to come back to
New Mexico now, when the state is
in such a drought, and to see how
everyone—including our local
and state officials—deals with the
lack of water."
Where has she been? She just
finished her first year of law school
at New Y ork University in New
Y ork City. Her decision to become
an attorney was spurred by her
work with Mujeres Unidas en Salud y
Desarrollo, a group that addresses
domestic violence issues in Costa
Rica. There, Lucrecia saw how
important good lawyers can be in
helping people.
This summer she worked on
the U.S. Highway 70 expansion
case, the Stericycle Medical W aste
plant case, the V elarde mica mill
case, and the HRI-ENDAUM
uranium case.
Marisa Martin, a Midwestern
native who had never been to New
Mexico before she arrived at our
office, is earning a joint J.D./M.S.
degree in law and Conservation
Biology & Ecosystem Management
from the University of Michigan.
She has one more year to complete
in her four-year program.
LAW CLERKS ON THE LOOSE
being able to walk to stores,
restaurants, museums, parks and
other urban amenities. They want
more housing choices—not just
cookie-cutter houses in the 'burbs.
They want better mass transit,
biking and walking trails. In
short, they want to live more like
our grand-parents did in the '20s
and '30s.
Some growth management solutions:
REGIONAL PLANNING
Most urban planners and smart
growth practitioners believe that
the first step to growth manage-
ment is regional planning. If one
local government espouses man-
aged growth, but the surrounding
county government doesn't,
growth management will fail.
Both jurisdictions need to be talk-
ing with each other and adopting
land use plans that govern the
whole area. 
REVENUE-SHARING
A second tool that shows great
promise in managing growth is
revenue-sharing. One overarching
reason local governments approve
development is for increased rev-
enue—in the form of both proper-
ty and sales taxes—which can lead
to sprawl in unincorporated areas.
If revenues from a region can go
into one pot and then be dis-
bursed to local governments for
services on a needed basis, there is
not the compulsion to approve
development in inappropriate areas.
UGBs
Another useful tool, albeit one of
the more controversial, is urban
growth boundaries. Oregon has
probably the strongest UGBs in
the country . In 1972 that state
mandated that all cities create a
line around their urban areas and
force all growth within it. In
one act of legislation, Oregon
almost instantly curtailed sprawl.
Unfortunately , this has had two
unintended consequences. One,
the cost of housing has increased
dramatically in that state, and sec-
ond, sprawl has "leapfrogged" into
neighboring states. Because of
Oregon's experience, growth man-
agement advocates now know that
two other planning tools must
accompany the use of UGBs—very

strong affordable housing programs
and a well-financed open space
acquisition program.
TDRS/PDRS
T wo related tools that are increasing
in use and popularity across the
country are "transfer of development
rights" and "purchase of develop-
ment rights" programs. A TDR, in is
simplest terms is a process that strips
the development rights off a parcel of
land that a community wants to pro-
tect as open space and transfers it to
a second parcel that it wants to
develop at a higher density than
what is legally allowed. A PDR
occurs when a local government or
non-profit entity purchases and
extinguishes a development right on
a property. The owner still retains
ownership, but is prohibited from
developing the property. This usually
occurs on agricultural land that
remains in production.

Marisa has known since high school
that she would make her mark as an
environmental lawyer, and her
internships during the past several
years have underscored the impor-
tance of environmental justice for
her. "It's incredibly meaningful to
work on a case with community-
based clients. I've worked on envi-
ronmental issues with indigenous
communities in Hawaii, and saw
first-hand how attorneys can help
people trying to save their ways of
life from environmental destruc-
tion. My work with the Law
Center has been just as reward-
ing."
Marisa was busy this summer
working on the US 70 case, the
V elarde mica mill case, the Phelps
Dodge closeout plans in Grant
County, the expansion of the T aos
airport, and was doing research
on industrial dairies in New Mexico.

ing of a copper mine west of T ruth or
Consequences, and the presentation of
a persuasive case for real reclamation
of the Phelps Dodge copper mines in
Grant county . Doug also was instru-
mental in preventing amendments to
the New Mexico Mining Act that
would have allowed mining compa-
nies to use corporate guarantees from
their parent companies for reclama-
tion bonds, a practice that would have
put New Mexico taxpayers at consid-
erable risk. 
Doug's work on mining issues has
been recognized not only in New
Mexico, but also at the national level:

aw Center Staff Attorney Doug Wolf stands next to
the plaque for the newly-created Ortiz Mountain
Educational Preserve. Over 100 people attended the
dedication in May. This 1,350 acre park southwest of
Santa Fe was donated to the Santa Fe Botanical
Garden (SFBG) as a result of the settlement negotiat-
ed between LAC Minerals and Friends of Santa Fe
County concerning the Cunningham Hill Gold Mine.
Also negotiated was the cleanup of a cyanide plume
from the mine, treatment of contaminated water, and
the reclamation of the land surrounding the mine pit.
Congratulations to everyone for their hard work on cre-
ating a model of reclamation that New Mexico can be
proud of!  For more information, please contact the

his efforts are the primary basis for
the award to the Law Center of a
National Award for Sustainability by
Renew America and the President's
Council on Sustainable Development. 
Doug has handled a variety of
other matters as well. He has fought
the Intel computer company on
issues pertaining to its use of water at
its Rio Rancho plant and to its pollu-
tion of the air surrounding that
plant; he has provided advice to
many community and environmen-
tal groups on issues they faced; and
he has represented members of ace-
quias in their efforts to preserve their
water rights.
Doug came to the Law Center
from the Natural Resources Defense
Council. In his interview, a Law
Center Board member asked Doug
why he would want to move from a
large national environmental organi-
zation to a group like the Law Center
that works only in one state. His
response was that the work at
NRDC was often removed from the
actual sites that the work affected,
and that he wanted to achieve more
concrete on-the-ground protection
for the environment. The concrete
results that he has achieved are spec-
tacular, and they can be seen
throughout New Mexico. 
W e and everyone working for
protection of the environment in
New Mexico will miss him.

dying in her eyes. I realized then, and have known ever since, that
there was something new to me in those eyes—something known
only to her and to the mountain.
