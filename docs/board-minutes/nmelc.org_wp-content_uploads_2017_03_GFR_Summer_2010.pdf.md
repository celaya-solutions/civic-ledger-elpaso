Law Center Resuscitates Rulemaking
“
”
On June 8, we foiled
plans by New Mexico’s
biggest industries
(PNM, El Paso
Electric, the NM Oil
and Gas Assoc.) to
not only kill our client’s
petition to limit
greenhouse gas 
emissions, but to 
cripple the State of
New Mexico’s
ability to adopt and
amend regulations.
On that day, Staff
Attorney Bruce
Frederick and 
Eric Miller of the
Attorney General’s
Office argued before
the five justices of
the New Mexico
Supreme Court that
a Lovington District
Court Judge had no
jurisdiction to stop
an administrative
climate change 
proceeding before the Environmental
Improvement Board (EIB). If the Supreme
Court did not intercede, they argued, any
party could sue at any time to stop any State
agency from even considering new 
regulations in the future.
“Wewould have – and we would deserve
– chaos,” Frederick argued in his rebuttal.
“State agency proceedings could easily be
shut down by any lawyer who can spot a legal
issue, no matter how frivolous, and the district
courts would become clogged with random
and premature
declaratory judgment
actions.”
In response, the
Supreme Court
issued a Writ of
Superintending
Control, which
ordered the district
judge to dismiss the
case, and allowed the
EIB to resume our
climate change
hearing in August.
Announcing the 
ruling after only 15
minutes of delibera-
tions, Supreme Court
Chief Justice Charles
Daniels stated that
the case raised serious
separation of powers
issues and that the 
district court had
mistakenly interfered
with an ongoing
executive agency
proceeding.
The Supreme Court
case sprang from a
lawsuit filed by four state lawmakers, 
business /industry groups and our state’s
utilities to stop the EIB from considering
New Energy Economy’s (our client’s) petition
to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the
state. In January, they filed their suit in a
district court in Lea County – the 
capital of our state’s oil region.
On a windy April day at the
Lovington courthouse, Judge
William G.W. Shoobridge, heard 
arguments in the case; shortly

Resources don't mean that uranium

Federal Judges Rule Against Navajo Communities 
On March 8, we received a 
disappointing decision in our 
federal appeal of Hydro Resources
uranium mining license.
As you may recall, in May
2008, we traveled to Denver with
a delegation from the Navajo
communities of Church Rock and
Crownpoint. There, we made the
case to the U.S. 10th 
Circuit Court of Appeals that the
uranium mining license granted
to Hydro Resources should be
thrown out. At the heart of my
legal arguments was the 
contention that uranium mining
in these communities will 
damage the health of the people who drink
the water and breathe the air that these
mines will impact.  
Unfortunately, two of the three judges on
our panel deferred to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) – an agency that has
historically promoted uranium mining and
the nuclear industry. The decision was not
unanimous; Judge Carlos Lucero dissented
“because the majority’s decision in this case
will unnecessarily and unjustifiably 
compromise the health and safety of the 
people who currently live within and 
immediately downwind from [the minesite].”
It is one of the strongest dissents that my
colleagues and I have ever seen. Despite
Judge Lucero’s dissent, however, the Court
refused our request for an en banc review, in
which all of the active judges on the 10th
Clients Chris Shuey of the Southwest Research 
and Information Center (SRIC) and Larry King 
of the Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium 
Mining (ENDAUM) discuss potential uranium 
mining at King’s home in Church Rock.
Circuit bench would have reviewed the
decision.
In a separate, but related case, the 10th
Circuit overturned its previous ruling on
which entity will regulate the groundwater
beneath the first proposed minesite. The new
ruling states that the proposed Church Rock
Section 8 site, despite being in a community
that is 97% Navajo, falls under the 
jurisdiction of the New Mexico Environment
Dept. The issue at hand – who governs an
Indian community in the Checkerboard
region – is legally significant, and it is likely
that the Navajo Nation (which was a party
to the case, along with the U.S. EPA and
Hydro Resources, Inc.) will not be satisfied
with the appellate decision. For our clients,
this ruling is especially significant because
by Eric J
antz
it means that the Navajo Nation’s
ban on  uranium mining no longer
applies to the site. 
Despite these rulings, this case
is far from over
. We are preparing
for permitting proceedings before
the NM Environment Department
later this year. If you are a 
member of the Law Center, you
know that as long as our clients
in Crownpoint and Church Rock
continue their struggle, we will
fight beside them. My colleagues
and I will keep you apprised of
our efforts.
Thank you for 
supporting our work.
thereafter, he ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.
We had to move quickly to preserve both
our climate change hearing, and the 
sanctity of the public rulemaking process in
New Mexico– and so made the rare move
of appealing directly to the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court does not do some-
thing like this unless there are extraordinary
circumstances involved,” says Frederick,
noting that only five percent of requests for
Writs of Superintending Control have been
granted during the past eight decades.“The
Lovington district court and EIB are two
separate branches of government.The court
cannot intercede in a state agency appeal–
the separation of powers issue made for
this extraordinary circumstance.” 
“We were confident that the Supreme
Court would put us back on track.We can
finally move ahead to create clean ener gy
jobs, provide a level playing field for small
business and the renewable energy industry,
and prove that solving global warming will
catalyze job creation,”said John Fogarty,
Executive Director of New Energy Economy.
Frederick is confident that the EIB 
hearings will resume and finish by the end
of the summer.

Twenty Two Years of Environmental and Community Victories    3
With New Mexico being the 7th largest
producer of dairy products in the nation,
we’re also one of our country’sbiggest
producers of cow manure. That much
manure
– approximately 2.2 billion gallons
per year – can wreak havoc on aquifers,
fouling them with nitrates, phosphorus,
ammonia, human pathogens and hormones
… not to mention the smell.    
The problem dairies pose to water quality
is not small. Of the roughly 150 dairies
operating in New Mexico, approximately
57% of them have documented groundwater
pollution (for those that monitor groundwater
quality), and a third are in abatement.
Some of this contamination is historic, and
new liners for liquid waste lagoons are 
better than their predecessors at preventing
leakage. At the same time, however, no one
is sure how well technology can treat this
contamination (no dairy has been fully
remediated in New Mexico yet), and we
know that cleaning up polluted groundwater
is never cheap or easy.   
To address these problems, and to comply
with a legislative mandate, the NM
Environment Department has drafted dairy-
specific regulations to protect groundwater.
But in some situations, the regulations don’t
go far enough.  So when our state’swater
quality watchdogs wanted to plug the holes
in the State’s proposal, they turned to the
Law Center for help.
Some key provisions for which the 
Law Center and its clients [Amigos Bravos,
Caballo Concerned Citizens Group, Citizens
for Dairy Reform, the Rio Grande Chapter
of the Sierra Club, and Food and Water
Watch] are advocating for:
• A minimum separation of 30’ between the  
bottom of manure lagoons and ground-
w
ater, instead of the 4’recommended by 
the State.
• Stricter setback requirements, including a 
buf
fer of at least 1 mile between dairies 
and populations of 10 or more homes or 
businesses, and keeping untreated waste 
away from food crops.
• Increased monitoring and reporting.
• A company must state in its permit 
application how many cows will be 
housed at the dairy
.
• A company must send a map of its 
proposed location to neighbors as part of 
the public notification process.
• A company must submit a closure plan 
with its application, and must provide a   
reclamation bond that would fund 
cleanup, in the event that the company 
cannot clean up the site when it closes.  
New Mexico Mooo-ving Towards Groundwater Protection
“By planning in advance, 
we will reduce the costs to
these companies, and reduce
the amount of contamination.”
–Brian Shields,
Director of Amigos Bravos, responding 
to Commissioner Howard Hutchinson’
s 
question about why public interest 
groups want dairies to have plans 
in place for closure.
Where are 
New Mexico’s dairies?
75% – Eastern
[Curry, Roosevelt, Chaves, Eddy + 
Lea Counties]
– approx. 266,000 cows
15% – Southern
[Doña Ana, Sierra + Luna Counties] 
– approx. 53,000 cows
10% – Albuquerque Area
[primarily South Valley] 
– approx. 35,500 cows

Positive Step in Homestake Case
Neighborhood NegotiatesBetter Air
For decades, residents north of Milan have
fought to get the Homestake Mining
Company to clean up the water polluted by
that company’s uranium mill, which was
shuttered in 1990. In March, the NM
Environment Department handed them a
small but significant victory, included in an
order renewing Homestake’s groundwater
discharge permit for its collection and 
evaporation ponds.
The renewal came on the heels of a 
public hearing, held in Grants in January.  
At the hearing, Staff Attorney Jon Block
represented members of the Bluewater
Valley Downstream Alliance (BVDA), a
grassroots groups comprised of citizens 
living in the shadow of the mill’s massive
tailings piles. In addition to presenting 
community concerns, the group submitted
technical testimony from Paul Robinson,
Research Director at the Southwest 
Research and Information Center (SRIC),
assisted by Chris Shuey, MPH, SRIC's
Environmental Health Specialist.
In his order renewing the permit,
Secretary of the Environment Department
Ron Curry specifically agreed that 
“residents have reason to be frustrated with
progress to date, and suspicious of promises
of remediation timelines.” He then stated
that a study being conducted by the
Army Corps of Engineers (and due to be
completed this year) may “prompt 
modifications to the larger remediation 
strategy of the Mill Site.”
“This is the first time anyone from the
State has acknowledged the issues and 
frustrations that our clients have expressed,”
explains Jon. “It is also the first time that a
regulatory agency has provided some hope
by indicating a commitment to restore
groundwater to usable condition in the 
foreseeable future – and the first time they
have offered the possibility of requiring
Homestake to change course if the study
shows that the company’s current 
reclamation efforts are not succeeding. Our
hope is that the Environment Dept. has opened
the door to working with BVDA and other
interested community organizations, to come
up with a realistic human time-bounded
clean up solution for this Superfund site. 
The fact that Secretary Curry told us that 
his Water Quality people will be paying 
attention to the Army Corp of Engineer's
assessment of the site is something we view
as a positive step.”  
Contamination from the massive mill
complex has plagued residents for more than
forty years. Because of unsafe levels of 
uranium, selenium and nitrates in drinking
water wells, the company was required to
haul water to families, hook residents up 
Soon after Staff Attorney Jon Block began working with the Greater Gardner Neighborhood
Association in Albuquerque to appeal an air quality permit, he realized it would be an uphill
fight.  For two years, residents of the neighborhood had fought the operational expansion of
the American Cement transfer facility, which often spewed hazardous cement dust into their
yards, homes, schools and businesses. Despite vocal opposition and documentation of 
pollution, the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Joint Air Quality Division issued a permit to
the facility that allowed it to operate 24 hours a day/ 365 days per year, and allowed it to
more than quadruple its emissions.
“This was yet another example of how the Air Quality Division does not consider public
testimony when considering air quality permits,” explained Jon “So, we decided to get the
results we wanted without them.”
Jon helped residents set up settlement negotiations with Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua
(GCC), the owner of the facility and one of the larger cement producers in the northern
hemisphere. “From my experience with these kinds of matters, I knew that attorneys would
likely complicate the proceedings. So I suggested that opposing counsel and I stay out of the
room, and let our clients and the company participate in a mediated negotiation – something
that had not taken place during the permitting process.”
The result was a win-win for the Greater Gardner Neighborhood Association and the
company. Among other outcomes, the company has agreed to install state-of-the-art 
monitoring equipment at the site, and is working with neighbors to implement a panel 
comprised of residents and company representatives to address any future concerns.
“We’re very pleased that our clients walked away with what they wanted,” says Jon.
“However, both they and I remain frustrated that this fight could have been avoided had the
City implemented a stakeholder process early on. Until the Air Division and the Board
become more responsive to citizens, I believe we will be working with residents in
Albuquerque for a long time to come in their fights against air pollution.”
“Residents have reason to 
be frustrated with progress 
to date, and suspicious of 
promises of remediation 
timelines.
”– NMED Secretary Ron Curry
to Milan’s municipal water system, and
pay residents’ water bills for a decade. 
Not satisfied with these stopgap measures,
our clients at the BVDA continue to fight
for true reclamation of the site and 
remediation of local groundwater.

Association. Doug Wood (left) and Kyle Silfer

Twenty Two Years of Environmental and Community Victories    5
On July 16, 2009, Navajo citizens 
and their allies commemorated 
the 30th anniversary of the United
Nuclear tailings spill with a 5 mile
walk past the broken earthen dam
that released 95 million gallons of
radioactive effluent and 1100 tons 
of radioactive tailings.
Over the past decade, the nuclear industry
has spent more than $600 million on 
lobbying, and $63 million on campaign
contributions.  So it is no wonder that the
nuclear industry is now crowing about its
pending revival and lining up for federally-
funded subsidies and loan guarantees.
Uranium mining is also benefiting from
the buzz. Last year, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission “streamlined” its uranium
mine licensing process because of an 
anticipated surge in license applications.
This Spring, FORBES magazine featured a
story about uranium mining’s potential for
big profits. We’ve known that the threat
has been growing – during 2009 our 
uranium caseload grew from three cases 
to twelve. In addition to our Crownpoint
Uranium Project and Homestake Mill
cases, here’s the latest on the mines
opposed by our clients:
•Roca Honda mine, on Mount 
 Taylor:
This is the first time that a uranium 
company is seeking a full-fledged mining
permit in New Mexico (mining permits
weren’
t required until 1993) This case will
determine how the State deals with pro-
posed uranium mines for decades to come.
• Mount Taylor mine, on Mount T
 aylor:
Fortunately, the State of Colorado recently
passed a law prohibiting General Atomics'
from opening its Cañon City
, CO uranium
mill until that site is remediated. It is
believed that remediation will take 50–100
years. Because General Atomics will be
unable to process the ore from the Mount
Taylor mine, in June the company backed
off of plans to reopen the mine.
• Nichols Ranch mine/Lost Creek
mine/Moor
e Ranch mine, in Wyoming,
and Dewey/Burdock mine in South
Dakota: As one of the few law firms to
work on federal uranium mine licensing
over the past decade, we didn’
t hesitate to
help oppose these license applications,
despite their distance from New Mexico.
These cases will determine the extent to
which regulators at the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission can utilize its new licensing

process that will  restrict opportunities 
for public participation and limit the
requirements for site-specific studies at
proposed in situ leach uranium mines.
•Pandora Mine, Moab, UT: Our most
recent uranium case involves a lawsuit
against the US Forest Service, which has
approved a plan to expand the Pandora
Mine on federal land near Moab. 
This 
lawsuit will help determine how federal
land management agencies permit 
uranium mines in the future.

It strikes me every time I look out my studio window 
at the arroyo and the hills, the junipers and the piñons of the 
Santa Fe watershed:
how lucky I am to rest my eyes every day
on hundreds of acres of open space. 
My own private view reminds me of my responsibility to 
provide this same view to people who can’ t afford to buy a 
piece of land next to the watershed or to the National Forest, 
who must live with what is being done to the views we all 
share, whether that be the Galisteo Basin, the desert alongside
Chaco Canyon, the threatened communities of Mora and 
San Miguel Counties, or any strip of open land that can fall 
prey to oil and gas development. Alone I can’t fight for the 
sanctity of the views that belong to us all, but through my

I can feel secure in the certainty that my interest and all 
our interests are being protected.
