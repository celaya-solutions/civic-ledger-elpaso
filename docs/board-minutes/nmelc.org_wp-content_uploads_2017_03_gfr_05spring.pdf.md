Celebrating 
Eighteen Years of
Environmental 
Victories
Spring 2005
The 2005 legislative session may go down on record
as one of the most anti-environmental sessions ever.
Many bills were introduced for industry that illus-
trated the power of uniting greed and anti-govern-
ment ideology, and would devastate large swaths of
New Mexico's environment if they had passed.
Perhaps the most seriously anti-environmental bills
of the entire session were Senate Bill 583, carried
by Senator Stuart Ingle (R-Portales) and the identical
House Bill 711, sponsored by Representative Jose
Campos (D-Santa Rosa). Each of these bills would
have prohibited the New Mexico Water Quality
Control Commission from protecting surface waters
not within the federal definition of
"waters of the United States" and from
adopting or enforcing standards and reg-
ulations for surface water that are more
stringent than those required by federal
law. Supported by the rapidly growing
commercial dairy industry and the New
Mexico Homebuilders Association, these
bills drew more fire from conservationists of
all stripes than any others introduced in this
session. They were extremely dangerous
bills in light of the Bush Administration's
rollbacks of federal regulations and defini-
tions of what categories of surface water
will be regulated at all by the federal gov-
ernment. In an ideological shift that should
have been embarrassing, conservative
Republicans abandoned their 'state's rights'
mantra and championed the federal govern-
ment as their savior.
If either of these bills had passed, between 20% and
40% of New Mexico's surface water would have been
completely unprotected and vulnerable to pollution from any
and all sources.
Fortunately, each of these bills died. SB 583 was
killed in the Senate Judiciary Committee after
intense lobbying by the Law Center and dozens of
other organizations. House Bill 711 was also the
subject of intense lobbying, and it died its own well-
deserved death in the House Judiciary Committee.
On the flip side, numerous bills introduced by envi-
ronmental interests met similar fates due to opposi-
tion by commercial and industrial interests, and a
few good bills actually made it through the legisla-
tive meat grinder and are on their way to the
Governor's desk. The casualties included:
HB 722 and SB 710 - Healthy Communities Act
- would have given strong protection from further
pollution to communities that already have more
polluting facilities than they can count;
HB 1004 - Air Quality Control Act Requirements
- and SB 668 -Stringency of Hazardous Waste
Act Rules - would have stripped the 'no more strin-
gent than federal standards' language out of both
the NM Air Quality and Hazardous Waste Acts,
thereby allowing NM to decide how much protec-
tion to afford communities and the environment
rather than having to follow the Bush
Administration's environmental rollbacks. NM busi-
ness and industry interests would have none of that,
and their mouthpieces in the Roundhouse killed
both bills.
On the very short list of winner's is the Strategic
Water Reserve Act which will provide a dedicated 
Roundhouse or Madhouse?

he Law Center won its lawsuit against Southwest Landfill, a con-
struction-debris landfill seeking to expand in the South Valley of
Albuquerque. We represent the South Valley Coalition of
Neighborhood Associations, the SouthWest Organizing Project, and
several individuals who have fought this expansion for nearly a decade.
Our clients are concerned that an expansion would contaminate
groundwater and threaten the safety of local residents, and that the
landfill’s existence in the South Valley is representative of the tremen-
dous environmental injustice perpetrated on the residents of the
South Valley, the majority of whom are Hispanic.
In 2003, the Bernalillo County Commissioners granted the landfill a
permit to expand from 80 acres to 140 acres. They did this  in spite
of county regulations prohibiting the expansion of private landfills in
“groundwater crucial areas” (areas containing current or potential
drinking water supplies), and with flagrant disregard to the decisions
againt the expansion that were issued by County staff and the
Bernalillo County Extraterritorial Land Use Commission.
The Law Center appealed in December 2003. Judge Linda Vanzi of
the Second District Court of New Mexico agreed with our argument
that the permit violates crucial area regulations, and ordered the per-
mit revoked. Southwest Landfill has appealed, and we will head back
to court this spring to defend our victory.

n February, 2004, the Law Center and our co-counsel filed an abo-
riginal title claim on behalf of Picuris Pueblo for land on which an
industrial mica mine is sited. The land, sacred to the Picuris People
because of its micaceous clay deposits, was sold by the US govern-
ment during the 1950s under the auspices of the federal 1872 Mining
Law. Maintaining
that it never
extinguished its
title to the land,
the Pueblo is ask-
ing a federal court
for the return of
the land as well as
monetary damages.
By the summer of
2004, Oglebay
Norton, the mine
operator since 1998, was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, litigating the title
claim, and facing opposition from the Pueblo as well as neighboring
communities. Oglebay Norton shut down the mine and its asso-
ciated mill in Velarde on September 1. The Pueblo is currently
pursuing settlement negotiations with Oglebay Norton.
The aboriginal title claim contin-
ues against the previous mine
operator, Tennessee-based
Franklin Minerals. On March 11,
2005, the U.S. District Court
heard oral arguments on Franklin
Mineral's Motion to Dismiss
Picuris Pueblo's claim against the
mining company. Franklin
Minerals argued that the United
States has to be a party to this
action because the case revolves
around mining patents and abo-
riginal claims to land. Franklin
also argued that if the Picuris
were successful in its claim, it
could question the validity of all
mining patents under the 1872 Mining Act. Franklin asked District
Court Judge Robert Brack to dismiss the Picuris' lawsuit.
Richard Hughes, our co-counsel from the firm of R othstein, Donatelli,
Hughes, Dahlstrom & Schoenburg, argued that predecessors in title,
such as the U.S. government, are never proper parties in a land claim
issue. He asserted that if this were the case, then land claim cases in
the United States would have to include claims against Lord
Baltimore, monarchs of England, or ancient Spanish rulers.
LAST MINUTE UPDATE: On March 31, we learned that Judge
Brack threw out Franklin’s Motion to Dismiss.With this 
victory under our belts, we will proceed to court with the title claim.

T
he U.S. Forest Service is seeking to amend the Forest Plan for the
Carson National Forest, in order to determine future land use for
the Valle Vidal, a unit of the Carson National Forest near the
Colorado border. The Valle, which is a winter home to New Mexico’s
largest elk herd and a summer home to 3,000 Boy Scouts from
Philmont Scout Ranch, is adjacent to Ted Turner’s Vermejo Park
Ranch, where El Paso Corp. has been drilling for several years.
The Law Center is a member of the Coalition for the Valle Vidal, a
group knit together from concerned individuals, conservation and
sportsmen’s groups, businesses, and local governments and chambers
of commerce. Since 2003, the Coalition has educated New Mexicans
about the impacts that gas drilling will have on the Valle, including
habitat fragmentation, air and water pollution, damage from roads and
wellpads, traffic and compressor noise.

CASE  UPDATES 3
Still, it is no surprise that the Coalition has been labelled “obstruction-
ist” by drilling advocates. Here is the Coalition’s rebuttal:
Already 88% of natural gas reserves occurring on federal lands in
the Rocky Mountain West are available for leasing and development.
Of the 2.6 million acres in the Raton Basin, we are working to pro-
tect 40,000 acres of land that was given to the American People
because of its spectacular beauty and critical habitat. The Valle hosts
more than 100 species of animals, including the endangered Rio
Grande cutthroat trout, and is ranked as one of the best horseback
riding and camping sites in the country.
Using figures provided by the Forest Service, experts at the Oil and
Gas Accountability Project estimate that the Valle Vidal would yield
between 11 and 36 hours of the national gas supply -- hardly enough
to make a dent in our foreign energy dependence.
Drilling advocates point to Vermejo Park as a model of environmen-
tally-sensitive drilling, but this claim has not been scientifically or
otherwise independently substantiated. The Coalition concedes that
conditions may better at Vermejo Park than on public lands, but
notes that the landowner is a billionaire who has the legal muscle to enact
strict covenants and full-time staff to monitor and enforce conditions.
This winter, the Forest Service has held public “open houses” across
northern New Mexico, as it prepares for the scoping process. During
the scoping process, the Forest Service will solicit comments about
what the public wants to see in the Valle Vidal in the future. Scoping
should last through the summer of 2005, and then the Forest Service
will begin the studies needed for an environmental impact statement.
The Law Center encourages its members to provide comments to the
Forest Service during this process. For more information, see the
Coalition’s website at www.vallevidal.org.

After more than eight years, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) has given the green light to Church Rock Section 8, HRI's
first proposed uranium mine for the Crownpoint-Church Rock region.
Four years ago, the Law Center argued that the license should be 
invalidated because its reclamation plan was inadequate, as was the
company's proposed surety bond. We cannot appeal this decision
until Phase II of litigation is completed, and HRI cannot begin mining
until it acquires an "aquifer exemption" that affirms that the area to be 
contaminated will not be used for drinking water. Our computer mod-
eling shows that there is a high likelihood that contamination will
migrate towards underground sources of drinking water, however.
We have begun Phase II of litigation, in which we will try to invalidate
the licenses for the remaining three proposed mines on the grounds
that the mines will contaminate air and groundwater. We anticipate
that this phase of the case will take between 12 and 18 months. If the
NRC agrees with us, and revokes HRI's licenses, we will likely appeal
the license for Section 8. If the NRC rules against us, as we anticipate,
we will likely appeal the entire project in federal court.
In addition to our work in the NRC proceeding, we are working with
our clients to pass legislation on the Navajo Nation that would ban 
traditional uranium mining techniques, and place a moratorium on in
situ leach mining. We are also heading  to court to defend the health-
based uranium groundwater standard adopted by the state of New
Mexico in 2004.
Our work on this case is more urgent - and difficult - than ever because
the price of uranium has more than doubled in the past two years to
nearly $22/lb. HRI has stated that uranium must fetch a minimum
price of $17/lb. in order to mine. For the last ten years, the price had
not met that threshold; now, however, mining would be a profitable
venture.
To review the timeline: HRI applied for its licenses in 1988. The NRC
granted the company licenses for four mines in 1997. In 1998, our
clients were granted “intervernor status,” and allowed to participate in
the proceeding. In 2001, we completed litigation of Section 8; the
Hearing Officer issued his decision in 2004. Our appeal was denied in
2005. We are now in Phase II of litigation, regarding the licenses for
the remaining three mines.

n February, Dharma Master Hsin Tao, a Taiwanese
Buddhist master and the founder of the Museum
of World Religions visited Las Imagines Archeological
District on the west side of
Albuquerque as a guest of
SAGE Council, one of the
Law Center's clients. The
Master came to honor and
bless the area. We walked
with the Master as he hiked
up the mesa. We stood at
the edge of the mesa, look-
ing at the storm coming in.
This area, the Las Imagines
Archaeological District, is a
volcanic escarpment stretching 17 miles along
Albuquerque's West Mesa escarpment. It contains
a gallery of an estimated 25,000 prehistoric Indian
and historic Hispanic petroglyphs. Early Pueblo
Indian residents began using this area for tradition-
al and cultural purposes between A.D. 1300 and
A.D. 1650, which included the carving of petro-
glyphs into the volcanic rock. The place remains
spiritually, traditionally, and culturally significant to
many Native Americans today.
We drove with the visitors
to Las Imagines. "This is
America's sacred place," said
one of the Buddhists on the
bus. We laughed because we
were passing a golf course.
But we weren't sure he was
joking.
Three months ago, the City
of Albuquerque won a bond
election which would allow
$8.7 million in bond money
for the extension of Paseo
del Norte through Las Imagines Archaeological
District. The bond question on the ballot asked for
$52 million of bonds for the improvement of
Albuquerque streets. It did not specifically mention
extending Paseo del Norte through Las Imagines
Archaeological District. On election night, Mayor
Martin J. Chavez said that "barring lawyers," construc-
tion will begin through this area in early 2005.
Two weeks ago, on February 17, 2005, the New
Mexico Environmental Law Center filed a lawsuit in
New Mexico District Court on behalf of SAGE
Council, the Sierra Club, the New Mexico
Archaeological Council, and seven other plaintiffs
requesting that the City of Albuquerque stop all planning, funding, and further con-
struction of Paseo del Norte through Las Imagines Archeological District.
The Master was told that this was a sacred place, and he lay flat on the ground. He said
he was feeling its energy. If it were anyone else, it would
have seemed funny. But for him, it just seemed to work.
The fact that he was a Buddhist, and Taiwanese, and came
to honor this place, was not lost on any of us.
Nineteen years ago, Las Imagines was placed on the state
register of cultural properties. Three years later, the New
Mexico legislature passed a law making it illegal to “use” a
cultural property such as Las Imagines in the way the City
wants to use it for the extension of this road. This simple
premise is the basis of the
lawsuit.
As of this writing, we have
yet to hear the City's
response to our lawsuit, we
have yet to face a judge, and
we have yet to have a deci-
sion. All these things will
play out in time.
And over time, the City of
Albuquerque continued to
grow. As one stands on top
of the mesa in Las Imagines,
one can almost literally look straight down and see
the city which has grown towards its boundaries. It
may have been seven hundred or so years ago that
Pueblo Indians began gathering here and marking
the petroglyphs we still see today, but the City of
Albuquerque wants to go through here NOW .
Looking at the petroglyphs and the volcanic rock
and even watching a Buddhist master move among
them, it is easy to imagine the ancient significance
of this place by its proximity and location to the
mountains, the river, the volcanoes. But the here
and now is also what gets lost in debate over Paseo
del Norte. Today, the cultural significance of the site remains important. Today, Native
Americans continue to use this site, and not just individual petroglyphs at the site, in
ceremonial ways. Today local residents use this protected area as a place for recreation.
Today archaeologist continue to find new knowledge about the area. Today, Las
Imagines Archaeological District remains on the State Register of Cultural Properties.
But what is foremost in our mind is the Mayor declaring that "construction will begin in
early 2005."  Two weeks ago, we filed suit against the City to stop construction. And
now we stand at the edge of the mesa looking at the storm coming in.

H
ow does the Law Center test the mettle of a brand new Staff Attorney?  By sending her
to the State Capitol during the legislative session on her very first day.
Perhaps it was her two years of experience with the First
Judicial District Attorney’s office in Santa Fe that girded her
for tough situations, but Sarah Piltch, our new attorney,
seemed to thrive on the action. Which bodes well for our clients.
A Los Alamos native, Sarah grew up hiking, skiing and
camping in New Mexico, and is very familiar with many of
the complex environmental and environmental justice issues
on which the Law Center works. “A desire to work for social
justice motivated me to become a lawyer. Seeing what hap-
pens at the Legislature has given me a first-hand glimpse of
how environmental injustice is perpetrated against communi-
ties that don't have the resources of large corporations to
influence what happens,” says Sarah. “I’m happy to be working for a firm that tries to level
that playing field.”
She attended Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa and graduated with a degree in philosophy in
1997. She received her law degree from the University of New Mexico Law School in 2000,
and then moved to Berkeley, CA, where she worked for non-profit organizations. She
returned to New Mexico in 2002, and began working at the Law Center in February.
Welcome, Sarah!

T
he Law Center would like to express its heartfelt gratitude to two exceptional individuals
who recently left our Board of Directors: Michael Lilley of Las Cruces, who served with
us since 1995, and Michael Guerrero of Albuquerque, who was a member of the Board since
2002. Both men provided invaluable insight, inspired us with their passion for justice, and
improved our lives with their senses of humor. We wish both the best of luck in their future
endeavors!

In August, 2005, Executive Director Douglas Meiklejohn and Law Center Board member
Pablo Padilla, Jr. were asked to serve with Richard Moore of the Southwest Network for
Economic and Environmental Justice (SNEEJ) as the three environmental justice advocates on
the New Mexico Environment Department’s Environmental Justice Policy Committee. In addition to
these voices, the Panel also includes three representatives for industry (in this case, PNM, the
NM Municipal League, and a lobbyist for the solid waste and other industries), and the Deputy
Secretary of the Department, Derrith Watchman-Moore.
In 2004, NMED held a series of listening sessions across New Mexico to solicit feedback on
the State’s environmental justice policies. Using the input from these meetings, as well as per-
sonal experience, Doug, Pablo and Richard are working to improve NMED’s policies so as to
diminish the impacts of polluting facilities on minority and low-income communities.
