A  BIG THANKS TO OUR MEMBERS
AND OUR BUSINESS DONORS
We were able to meet the match require-
ment needed for a $25,000 grant from a
local foundation. Thanks to everyone
who made that possible!

In August, the Law Center was honored by
the American Bar Association (ABA) with
an award that recognizes individuals,
organizations, or programs that have dis-
tinguished themselves in environmental law
and policy, contributing
significant leadership in
improving the substance,
process or understanding
of environmental protec-
tion and sustainable
development. The award
was established by the
ABA's Standing
Committee on
Environmental Law and
was co-sponsored this
year by the ABA Section
of Environment, Energy
and Natural Resources.
As the first public-interest
law firm bestowed with this accolade, the
Law Center was selected for its efforts to
promote environmental justice in specific
communities as well as its work to foster it
within state policies, laws and regulations.
"We're thrilled to be recognized as a
national leader in promoting environmental
justice," states Douglas Meiklejohn,
Director of the Law
Center. "Few people want
a landfill or a uranium
mine next to their home;
unfortunately, it is often
communities with few
financial resources and lit-
tle political clout that end
up with a disproportion-
ate number of these facili-
ties. The Law Center
strives to help level the
playing field for these
communities, so that resi-
dents have a voice in the
legal proceedings that affect them."
We have worked closely with Ms. Gauna
on statewide environmental justice issues,
and we are grateful for and flattered by her
nomination.

I
n the fall of 2003, the president of
Counselor Chapter learned that the Bureau
of Land Management (BLM) was poised to
offer up two parcels of land sacred to Navajo
residents for oil and gas development.
Despite the fact that the parcels are impor-
tant for religious, cultural, historical and envi-
ronmental reasons, the BLM did not consult
with either Counselor Chapter or the Navajo
Nation prior to making its decision to open
these sites. To stop the permanent destruc-
tion of these lands, Counselor Chapter
approached the Law Center to help it develop
legal means by which to protect the sites.
In early April, the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management backed off its decision to offer
the parcels for oil and gas lease sale. Under
threat of a formal protest of the lease sale
prepared by the Law Center on behalf of
Counselor Chapter and because of negotia-
tions by Counselor Chapter, the BLM deter-
mined that it would not offer the two parcels
of land for lease sale for the foreseeable future.

ver the past three years, ENDAUM, a
grassroots Navajo organization, has
been in settlement negotiations with Hydro
Resources, Inc. (HRI), the company that pro-
poses to perform in-situ leach uranium min-
ing in the aquifer beneath the Crownpoint-
Church Rock region. While HRI has been
licensed, it has not been allowed to com-
mence mining.
In February, 2004, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's Presiding Officer issued a 55-
page decision on Section 8, which is the first
proposed mining site. Admittedly, it is a
mixed decision for our clients. On the posi-
tive side, the Presiding Officer ruled that
there are deficiencies in the RAP that will
have to be cured; unfortunately, HRI will be
able to resubmit its RAP for approval. This
spring, the Law Center appealed the Presiding
Officer's decision to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, which is comprised of five
commissioners who are appointed by the
President and confirmed by the Senate. We
have just concluded briefing on the appeal
and are awaiting a decision, which we believe
will be issued within the next
three months.
The decision on the appeal will
mean two things. First, if the
NRC, which has shown a heavy
bias in favor of industry in the
past, decides in favor of HRI,
HRI's license to mine at Section
8 will be valid; however, HRI will
still have to obtain an aquifer
exemption and underground
injection permit before it can
drill. Second, we will begin
Phase II litigation, in which we
argue to prevent mining in the
remaining three sites. Central to
our arguments will be HRI's
inability to protect the drinking
water aquifer in which they pro-
pose to mine.

n June 7, the New Mexico Water
Quality Control Commission handed
the Law Center and the New Mexico
Groundwater Bureau a major victory by
deciding unanimously to lower New Mexico’s
groundwater standard for uranium to 30
micrograms per liter of water (ug/L), down
from the previous 5,000 ug/L. The Law
Center presented extensive evidence about
the adverse health effects of uranium, a toxic
heavy metal, when ingested through drinking
water. This decision will protect current and
future drinking water supplies throughout
New Mexico. Several Indian tribes, including
the Navajo Nation, several New Mexico
counties, ranchers and ordinary citizens testi-
fied in support of lowering the standard. The
New Mexico Mining Association, especially
its members that engage in uranium mining,
including HRI, strongly opposed lowering the
standard, arguing that it would be too expen-
sive to comply with.

or nearly a decade, Picuris Pueblo has
pursued legal, political and public avenues
to stop the expansion of, and ultimately shut
down, an industrial mica mine located on the
Pueblo’s aboriginal lands. Especially impor-
tant to the Pueblo are sacred clay pits that
have been systematically obliterated by mining
activities over the past ten years.
On February 20, the Pueblo filed an aborigi-
nal title claim for the lands on which the
mine is sited. Declaring that the title has
never been extinguished, the Pueblo is asking
that Oglebay Norton, the current mine opera-
tor, be evicted from the land, and that the
current and previous operators be required to
pay the Pueblo damages.
Oglebay Norton, the current operator,
declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy three days
after the land claim was filed; proceedings
against Oglebay Norton are on hold until fur-
ther notice. In the meantime, Franklin
Minerals, the previous operator of the mine,
has removed the case to federal court; we
have filed a motion to remand to state court,
arguing that the company missed its deadline
to request removal. We are currently awaiting
a decision on this issue. Franklin has also filed

a motion to dismiss our case, which will be decided
once venue is determined. We anticipate that, barring
a settlement, there will be a fairly intensive discovery
period in the land claim litigation before courtroom
proceedings begin.

ince 2001, we have represented the Gila Resources
Information Project (GRIP) in administrative pro-
ceedings to determine what State-mandated closeout
plans of the Chino and Tyrone copper mines will
look like. GRIP's goal in participating in these pro-
ceedings is to ensure that when Phelps Dodge closes
these mines, reclamation is done in a way that will
protect the scarce groundwater resources upon which
local communities may rely.
In April 2003, the New Mexico Environment
Department issued a groundwater permit for the
Tyrone mine. Phelps Dodge appealed the permit to
the Water Quality Control Commission (WQCC), but
was denied on several issues, including the exemption
of the Tyrone mine from state water quality  laws and
the use of an open pit capture zone at the Tyrone
mine which would have allowed over 1,100 acres of
stockpiles to remain unreclaimed.
In its appeal, Phelps Dodge argued that NMED
lacked statutory authority to impose permit condi-
tions in water quality discharge permits. Under Phelps
Dodge's theory, NMED can not impose its own con-
ditions in any water discharge permits, and must sim-
ply accept or reject any conditions for clean-up sug-
gested by polluters in draft permits submitted to the
Department. The Law Center, on behalf of GRIP ,
successfully argued to the WQCC that this proposal
would have led to self-regulation by polluters.
When the results of this hearing are combined with
the settlement reached with Phelps Dodge last fall
regarding tailing impoundments at the Tyrone mine,
our client has obtained nearly every groundwater pro-
tection provision it had sought to obtain in the
Tyrone closure plan.
Welcomes & Farewells
We are happy to announce the newest Law Center board members, who bring with
them a tremendous diversity of experience and perspectives.
MMAX CCOLL served as an advocate for New Mexico's air, land and water in the New Mexico
Legislature for more than thirty years. His record on the environment speaks for itself: as
Chair of the House Appropriations Committee, he was instrumental in the passage of several
key laws that protect New Mexicans' environment and health, including the Solid Waste Act,
the Subdivision Act and the Mining Act. He also helped to pass regulations that allow the State
to set emissions standards for incinerators that are more stringent than federal standards.
SSUSANNE HHOFFMAN-DDOOLEY is an attorney who works for the Office of the State
Engineer and specializes in water law and water issues. She headed the adjudication of water
rights in the Lower Rio Grande basin until recently, when she took over the State Engineer's
Active Water Resource Management regulations project which will put in place regulations in a
number of stream systems in New Mexico to administer water uses during the drought. Since
coming to New Mexico, she has been involved with the Law Center in various ways and has
most recently served on the Center's fundraising committee for a number of years.
PPABLO PPADILLA,,  JJR.. attends UNM School of Law and expects to graduate in June 2005.
He has extensive experience working on both tribal and environmental issues. Over the past
ten years, he has worked in different capacities for the Pueblo of Zuni, and has also performed
pro bono consultation to the Walapai Nation, interned for the Environmental Defense Fund
and is currently interning with Law and Resource Planning Associates.
RROBBY RRODRIGUEZ is Co-Director of SouthWest Organizing Project. He has been
employed there since 1997, working to organize New Mexico communities around issues of
youth criminalization, environmental, and economic and social justice. He has worked with the
Law Center extensively on cases such as the Southwest Landfill expansion and those concern-
ing Intel air quality and water rights.
The Law Center would like to express its heartfelt gratitude to Linda Siegle and 
Verna Williamson Teller, who have served on our board of directors for eight and seven
years, respectively. We have been guided by their insight, made better through their talents, and
inspired by their passion to protect the communities of New Mexico. Thank you, Linda and
Verna, and we wish you well in your other endeavors!
The Law Center also sends our best wishes to former Staff Attorney Heather Anderson and
her husband Arden as they celebrate the birth of their son, Kaleb. Heather was lead counsel
on our work with Picuris Pueblo, SAGE Council, the Valley Community Preservation Commission.
“When the results of this 
hearing are combined with the 
settlement reached with Phelps Dodge
last fall, our client has obtained nearly
every groundwater protection provision
it had sought in the Tyrone mine
closure plan.”
