Law Center Wins in Supreme Court

able to bring the case to the
Supreme Court for review.
Kennedy also said that the
Governor halted the printing so
that her officecould "have time
to review" the new rules.
At one point Kennedy stated
that those who would be affected
have standing. Chief Justice
Daniels asked “... affected by the
air?” “Yes, if you can show...”said
Kennedy.“...That they breathe? ”
replied Chief Justice Daniels.  
At which point the entire
audience laughed. 
The Justices then moved on to
Kennedy’s other argument. The Chief Justice
questioned Kennedy on what authority the
Governor had to halt the printing, asking:
“Wouldn’t you agree that no person is above
the rule of law?” Justice Chavez added, “I
don’t see how the Governor has the
authority to trump the law. Then the
Governor can trump
any law.”
After a recess of only thirty minutes, the
Court returned, and Chief Justice Daniels 
stated that the Court would issue a writ
against the State 
Records Administrator, 
compelling her to printthe rules. Chief Justice
Daniels also said the Records Administrator
has a non-discretionary duty to follow the
law to publish the rules and “let the validity
of those regulations be tested” through
established means.
Shortly before this case was 
heard by the Supreme Court, 
industry groups appealed both
regulations to the State Court of  
Appeals. We will participate in 
the cases this year.
The New Mexico
Environmental
Law Center scored
a substantial win in
the state's Supreme
Court on January
26th, when the
Justices unani-
mously granted a
writ of

ordering the
State Records
Administratorto
print two new rules
adopted by state
agencies.
The Law Center petitioned the Court for
the writ on behalf of its clients,Amigos
Bravos and New Energy Economy. Our goal:
to compel the Records Administrator to print
the dairy groundwater discharge regulations
and the greenhouse gas emissions rule in the
State 
Register.The printing of these and 30
other rules was halted by Governor Martinez
on January 6.
In a packed courtroom, Staff Attorney
Bruce Frederick ar gued that the State
Records Administrator had a “non-
discretionary duty to publish rules that have 
been filed with the State Records Center.” He
asserted that the refusal to print the rules was
a violation of law, and that Governor Martinez'
attempt to circumvent the law was a threat to
the basic process by which administrative law
is adopted and made accessible to the public.  
Paul Kennedy, the private attorney 
representing the Governor's office, argued
that the groups that brought the petition had
no standing (i.e.,were not directly impacted
by the outcome of the case) and should not be

New Governor Wages War on EnvironmentCitizens not “ cowed”by new politics
Citizens and groups overcome first political assault; now get ready for Court
As New Mexico’s dairy groundwater 
regulations were nearing adoption in 2010, 
a national anti-regulation movement, well
financed by polluting industries, was gaining
momentum.  The movement’s pundits and
politicians added the prefix“job killing” to
every mention of regulations.  Susana Martinez
signaled her alliance with that movement by
making the “job-killing” tag a prominent
feature of her campaign for governor.  
The week before Gov. Martinez failed in
her attempt to halt the publication of the
dairy groundwater regulations (See page 1),
the dairy industry appealed the regulations
to the state Court of Appeals. The Law Center
will be in Court defending the regulations
on behalf of its clients, known collectivelyas
the “Citizens’ Coalition”: Amigos Bravos,
Caballo Concerned Citizens, the Rio Grande
Chapter of the Sierra Club, and Food and
Water Watch. 
New Mexico’s first concentrated animal
feeding operation (a dairy with more than
700 cows) opened in the mid 1980s. Today,
on average, NM dairies house more than
2,000 cows per operation – the highest
Law Center client Jerry Nivens, of Sierra County, was one of the first to start 
New Mexico’scitizens’ dairy movement rolling. It was in 2007, after he heard 
rumors that a 2,000-head-dairy operation was to open near his home. He spent his 
birthday driving around looking for a public posting and found a notice from the 
proposed ParaSol Dairy alongside a seldom-used road. The only newspaper notice 
had appeared in the Hatch Citizen. “Hatch is 20 miles to the south,” Nivens said.
“By no stretch of the imagination did that meet the requirements of the law to 
inform the public. Hatch isn’t even in Sierra County.”
Nivens circulated a petition and organized the Caballo Concerned Citizens 
Group. By the time ParaSol ran a notice in the Sierra County 
Sentinel, Nivens had 
gathered hundreds of signatures. Farmers downstream feared their crops could be 
contaminated by E.coli, and those in the tourism industry worried about smells. Even the federal Bureau of Reclamation
opposed the permit because the proposed site was in “an extremely sensitive location, basically on top of [Caballo] 
reservoir.” Despite concerted public protest and the denial of the permit twice by NMED Secretary Ron Curry, the permit
was granted– although with numerous environmental conditions – by the Water Quality Control Commission in June 2010. 
The permit and the Governor aren’t stopping Jerry Nevins, however. “Our health and our property are in danger,” 
he said. “When I was a boy, I saw this happen in Texas when the big feed lots came in.” If Nevins has anything to say
about it, that history isn’t going to repeat itself in New Mexico.

U.S.  One cow can produce as much waste
as twenty people, so living near a factory
dairy is like living near a small city that has
no sewers or waste-treatment plant, just giant
evaporative lagoons that might be lined
with only manure or clay. Approximately
57 percent of the state’s dairies have polluted
the groundwater beneath their facilities,
according to the state’s Environment
Department’s scientific data.  
After a permit application for the proposed
ParaSol Dairy in Sierra County was denied
in 2008(see below),the dairy industry 
successfully lobbied for regulations with the
goal of making permitting more predictable.
By early 2010, the New Mexico Environment
Department (NMED) developed draft 
regulations with input from dairy farmers,
the public and the Citizens’ Coalition 
(represented by Law Center attorneys Jon
Block and Bruce Frederick).  After four
weeks of technical hearings, the regulations
were adopted by the Water Quality Control
Commission in December 2010.
Though the regulations do not incorporate
Administration working publicly and in secret to undermine protections
Governor Susana Martinez wasted no time trying to gut the regulations that protect 
New Mexico’s natural resources and public health. And the Law Center wasted no time 
blocking her.  Some of her anti-environmental, anti-community efforts over the past three
months include:
1)  OFF TO A ROCKY START. Governor-elect Martinez sent the message to New Mexicans who care
about our environment that we’re in for a tough four years when she appointed an environmental 
transition team consisting of representatives of the oil & gas industry, the dairy industry, the energy
industry, Los Alamos National Lab, and the ranching industry.  Soon afterward, she accepted nearly
$300,000 in corporate contributions for her inauguration from power companies, oil & gas 
companies, and Helena Chemical.
2)  HER FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER. Just minutes after being sworn in, Governor Martinez signed 
her first Executive Order (2011-001), which orders government agencies to identify “job-killing” 
regulations that can be modified or rescinded in order to assist “small” businesses. 
3)  REGULATIONS? WHAT REGULATIONS? On January 3, a lobbyist for 
the dairy industry emailed the Governor’s office, asserting his view that the 
first Executive Order gave the Governor power to stop the printing of dairy 
groundwater regulations adopted in 2010. He then helpfully included the phone
number for the State Records Center. Two days later, the publication of the dairy regulations, 
greenhouse gas emission limits, and 30 other regulations were halted. (See page 1, on the Law Center’s successful
lawsuit in the New Mexico Supreme Court to overturn this decision.)
4)  TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD…AS LONG AS IT CAN BE DONE IN SECRET. On her website, Governor
Martinez states, “As public servants, we are accountable to New Mexicans and they should know exactly what their
government is doing on their behalf.” Yet her “Small Business-Friendly Task Force” met secretly for the first two months…and may have
continued its undercover operations except for the dogged reporting of blogger Tracy Dingmann of ClearlyNewMexico.com.
5)  BUT WAIT…THERE’S MORE.Dingmann uncovered the fact that there are not too many “small business” people on the 
Small Business-Friendly Task Force. Instead, lobbyists for, and representatives of, some of New Mexico’s biggest industries 
(and biggest polluters) fill many of the seats at the meetings.
6)  DIABOLICAL PLANS ARE AFOOT. According to the Task Force’s Mid-Point Report 
(found at our website, nmelc.org), the “goal [of the Task Force] is to provide the Governor 
and/or agencies cover when repealing or revising a rule or regulation thus avoiding litigation 
if possible… Each troublesome regulation will be accompanied by a recommendation on the best 
way to reduce their negative impacts.” Objectives outlined in the report include weakening the 
Oil and Gas Pit Rule, climate change regulations, and “mitigating” mid-level classified 
State employees who have an “anti-business political agenda.” 
7)  
“ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE COMMUNISTS.”Governor Martinez’s first nominee 
for Secretary of The Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, Harrison Schmitt, 
equated environmentalists with communists. Although Dr. Schmitt withdrew before he was 
appointed, we anticipate that Governor Martinez will continue to champion decision-makers who 
defer to industry over the environment and the health of our state’s residents.
8)  
NEVER SAY DIE [TO A PERMIT APPLICANT ].In 2010, the Camino Real Landfill in Sunland Park filed for a 10 year permit renewal.
Representing local residents, the Law Center petitioned the Environment Department to reconsider the application after significant facts 
in the case changed. Less than two weeks after NMED Secretary-designate F. David Miller took office, however, he granted the permit. 
We anticipate that this will be the first of many permit decisions that will benefit industry at the expense of vulnerable communities;
the Law Center will continue to work on behalf of these communities.
all of the Coalition’s proposals, they contain
many safeguards including synthetic lagoon
liners, specific requirements for separating
manure solids from wastewater discharges,
metering the flow of wastewater, collecting
groundwater samples and analyzing and
reporting the results. 
Coalition activists are not surprised that
Gov. Martinez, whose campaign accepted
more than $80,000 from the dairy industry
(according to FollowTheMoney.org), tried 
to block the regulations.  The revelation that
her Small Business-Friendly Task Force is
packed with big business representatives,
including a lobbyist for the dairy industry,
did not shock them either.
Despite the opposition, client Brian Shields,
Executive Director of Amigos Bravos, is
confident that the regulations will be
upheld in court. “Even though the dairy
industry is working behind the scenes, we
are confident we have what we need,” 
he said. “Science is on our side. Common
sense is on our side.”

(The Bolling case, which was consolidated
with the chloride case in 2010, was argued
before Judge Vigil in December.) At the
conclusion of the chloride standard hearing,
the judge announced that she would send
the Bolling case directly to the state Court

The timing of these cases will depend
upon a decision by Judge Vigil as to whether
or not the chloride standard is remanded
back to the Oil Conservation Commission.

Pit Rule will go to higher Court
Law Center still working to reverse politically-
charged chloride standard rollback
“At the original Pit Rule hearing, an Oil
Conservation Division staffer explained
how pit liners are installed incorrectly. In
fact, he showed 100 photos of torn or other-
wise improperly installed liners,” stated
Attorney Eric Jantz in District Court on
February 23. “Nine months later, when it
raised the chloride standard by 1100%, the
Oil Conservation Commission acted as if 
all of the sudden, oil and gas operators are
installing liners correctly.”  
Speaking to Judge Barbara Vigil, Jantz
explained that compelling evidence such as
liner testimony led the Commission to adopt
the stringent Pit Rule standards in the first
place. When it weakened the standard less
than a year later, the Commission’s change
of heart was not based on compelling
evidence, but on a backroom deal between
Governor Bill Richardson and the oil and
gas industry. As such, it is a flawed standard
that should be revisited or rescinded.
But audience members left disappointed
if they were hoping for rulings on either the
chloride case, or the “Bolling” case, which
is an industry appeal of the Pit Rule.
On behalf of Concerned Citizens for Nuclear
Safety (CCNS), NMELC Staff Attorney Jon Block
filed a motion to intervene in the on-going Federal District Court case between the
Department of Energy (DOE) and the New Mexico Secretary of the Environment over the
Los Alamos National Laboratory hazardous waste permit. 
CCNS is concerned that (1) the permit as issued does not address the need for closure 
and post-closure plans on three major areas that need remediation from years of hazardous
radioactive, chemical and mixed waste disposal; (2) the permit does not require ground
water monitoring for those areas; and (3) the permit does not eliminate continued open 
burning of hazardous waste as a disposal method. The DOE filed the suit charging that
NMED was trying to regulate radioactive materials under the permit, but also challenging
other portions of the permit in the same complaint. 
At this point, CCNS' motion to intervene in the matter is pending. 
The Law Center filed a motion on
February 11th to dismiss an application by
a corporation to appropriate 54,000 acre
feet of groundwater per year – enough
water to support a new city of hundreds of
thousands of people. In its application,
Augustin Plains Ranch, LLC, seeks 
permission from the New Mexico State
Engineer to drill 37 wells, 3,000 feet deep,
on its corporate ranch located near Datil,
NM, for the purpose of selling or using the
water anywhere within several counties. 
“The application has to be thrown out,
because it is so vague and speculative that
the State Engineer can’t evaluate or
approve it,” said Bruce Frederick, the Law
Center attorney who filed the motion on
behalf of about 80 residents who live in
west-central New Mexico. “Under our law,”
stated Frederick, “no corporation or any
other person can monopolize or hoard an
entire supply of free public water for the
purpose of speculative future sales. It’s
unconstitutional and flies in the face of
over 150 years of western water law, 
which is based on beneficial use.”
In addition to several tribes and pueblos
that signed on to the Law Center motion,
the Law Center has some interesting 
bedfellows in this case, including the 
federal Bureau of Reclamation and the
Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District.
The hearing examiner assigned to the case
will hear oral arguments beginning on May
20th. The location of the oral argument 
has not yet been established.

Do you and your business value clean air,
clean water, healthy communities, and a robust 
economy for New Mexico?
I bet you do.
There’s no better time to show that your business cares about 
our environment. Now more than ever, the input from our 
business community is tremendously important in stopping 
regulatory rollbacks. For example, you can contact your legislators who are working
on relevant interim committees, or you can 
write letters to the editor of your local paper.
Another way your business can make a 
difference is by becoming a Law Center 
Green Business Partner. For as little as
$250/ year, your business will be a key 
partner in helping us keep New Mexico a 
beautiful and healthy place to live and work.
I can’t wait to talk with you about your 
commitment to the environment, and the 
benefits this program can offer your business.

liner testimony led the Commission to adopt
the stringent Pit Rule standards in the first
place. When it weakened the standard less
than a year later, the Commission’s change
of heart was not based on compelling
evidence, but on a backroom deal between
Governor Bill Richardson and the oil and
gas industry. As such, it is a flawed standard
that should be revisited or rescinded.
But audience members left disappointed
if they were hoping for rulings on either the
chloride case, or the “Bolling” case, which
is an industry appeal of the Pit Rule.
On behalf of Concerned Citizens for Nuclear
Safety (CCNS), NMELC Staff Attorney Jon Block
filed a motion to intervene in the on-going Federal District Court case between the
Department of Energy (DOE) and the New Mexico Secretary of the Environment over the
Los Alamos National Laboratory hazardous waste permit. 
CCNS is concerned that (1) the permit as issued does not address the need for closure 
and post-closure plans on three major areas that need remediation from years of hazardous
radioactive, chemical and mixed waste disposal; (2) the permit does not require ground
water monitoring for those areas; and (3) the permit does not eliminate continued open 
burning of hazardous waste as a disposal method. The DOE filed the suit charging that
NMED was trying to regulate radioactive materials under the permit, but also challenging
other portions of the permit in the same complaint. 
At this point, CCNS' motion to intervene in the matter is pending. 
The Law Center filed a motion on
February 11th to dismiss an application by
a corporation to appropriate 54,000 acre
feet of groundwater per year – enough
water to support a new city of hundreds of
thousands of people. In its application,
Augustin Plains Ranch, LLC, seeks 
permission from the New Mexico State
Engineer to drill 37 wells, 3,000 feet deep,
on its corporate ranch located near Datil,
NM, for the purpose of selling or using the
water anywhere within several counties. 
“The application has to be thrown out,
because it is so vague and speculative that
the State Engineer can’t evaluate or
approve it,” said Bruce Frederick, the Law
Center attorney who filed the motion on
behalf of about 80 residents who live in
west-central New Mexico. “Under our law,”
stated Frederick, “no corporation or any
other person can monopolize or hoard an
entire supply of free public water for the
purpose of speculative future sales. It’s
unconstitutional and flies in the face of
over 150 years of western water law, 
which is based on beneficial use.”
In addition to several tribes and pueblos
that signed on to the Law Center motion,
the Law Center has some interesting 
bedfellows in this case, including the 
federal Bureau of Reclamation and the
Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District.
The hearing examiner assigned to the case
will hear oral arguments beginning on May
20th. The location of the oral argument 
has not yet been established.

Do you and your business value clean air,
clean water, healthy communities, and a robust 
economy for New Mexico?
I bet you do.
There’s no better time to show that your business cares about 
our environment. Now more than ever, the input from our 
business community is tremendously important in stopping 
regulatory rollbacks. For example, you can contact your legislators who are working
on relevant interim committees, or you can 
write letters to the editor of your local paper.
Another way your business can make a 
difference is by becoming a Law Center 
Green Business Partner. For as little as
$250/ year, your business will be a key 
partner in helping us keep New Mexico a 
beautiful and healthy place to live and work.
I can’t wait to talk with you about your 
commitment to the environment, and the 
benefits this program can offer your business.
Please call me at 505-989-9022, or see our 
website at
nmelc.org.
Sincerely,
Sebia Hawkins,
Director of Development

Law Center Wins in Supreme Court
AgainFirst lawsuit against Governor Martinez
affirms she is not “above the law. ”
able to bring the case to the
Supreme Court for review.
Kennedy also said that the
Governor halted the printing so
that her officecould "have time
to review" the new rules.
At one point Kennedy stated
that those who would be affected
have standing. Chief Justice
Daniels asked “... affected by the
air?” “Yes, if you can show...”said
Kennedy.“...That they breathe? ”
replied Chief Justice Daniels.  
At which point the entire
audience laughed. 
The Justices then moved on to
Kennedy’s other argument. The Chief Justice
questioned Kennedy on what authority the
Governor had to halt the printing, asking:
“Wouldn’t you agree that no person is above
the rule of law?” Justice Chavez added, “I
don’t see how the Governor has the
authority to trump the law. Then the
Governor can trump
any law.”
After a recess of only thirty minutes, the
Court returned, and Chief Justice Daniels 
stated that the Court would issue a writ
against the State 
Records Administrator, 
compelling her to printthe rules. Chief Justice
Daniels also said the Records Administrator
has a non-discretionary duty to follow the
law to publish the rules and “let the validity
of those regulations be tested” through
established means.
Shortly before this case was 
heard by the Supreme Court, 
industry groups appealed both
regulations to the State Court of  
Appeals. We will participate in 
the cases this year.
The New Mexico
Environmental
Law Center scored
a substantial win in
the state's Supreme
Court on January
26th, when the
Justices unani-
mously granted a
writ of
mandamus
ordering the
State Records
Administratorto
print two new rules
adopted by state
agencies.
The Law Center petitioned the Court for
the writ on behalf of its clients,Amigos
Bravos and New Energy Economy. Our goal:
to compel the Records Administrator to print
the dairy groundwater discharge regulations
and the greenhouse gas emissions rule in the
State 
Register.The printing of these and 30
other rules was halted by Governor Martinez
on January 6.
In a packed courtroom, Staff Attorney
Bruce Frederick ar gued that the State
Records Administrator had a “non-
discretionary duty to publish rules that have 
been filed with the State Records Center.” He
asserted that the refusal to print the rules was
a violation of law, and that Governor Martinez'
attempt to circumvent the law was a threat to
the basic process by which administrative law
is adopted and made accessible to the public.  
Paul Kennedy, the private attorney 
representing the Governor's office, argued
that the groups that brought the petition had
no standing (i.e.,were not directly impacted
by the outcome of the case) and should not be
