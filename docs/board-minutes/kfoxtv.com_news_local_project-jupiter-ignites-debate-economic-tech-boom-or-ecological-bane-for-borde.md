Project Jupiter ignites debate: Economic tech boom or ecological bane for Borderland?
EL PASO, TEXAS (KFOX14/CBS4) — Meta’s announcement of a new AI data center in El Paso comes just one month after Project Jupiter — another massive data center planned next door in Doña Ana County — took a major step forward.
Here’s the background behind that project and how we got here.
Known as Project Jupiter, this artificial intelligence data center is expected to bring significant investment and job opportunities to the region.
However, it also raises questions about water usage, energy demands, and community impact.
RECOMMENDED: Meta to build $1.5 billion AI data center in El Paso, creating nearly 2,000 jobs
Project Jupiter is a key component of Stargate, a national pipeline project aimed at expanding the U.S.'s capacity to train and run massive AI systems.
The initiative, announced by President Trump in January alongside tech giants OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, involves a $500 billion investment across the country.
Five AI data centers are planned, including locations in:
- Santa Teresa, New Mexico
- Abilene, Texas
- Milam County, Texas
- Shackelford County, Texas
- Lordstown, Ohio
Developers chose the desert location for its open land, available infrastructure, and access to regional energy corridors.
In September, Doña Ana County commissioners voted to move the project forward after several public meetings.

While some residents support the project for its potential to create jobs and boost the local economy, others express concerns about environmental impacts.
One supporter highlighted the opportunities for youth and workforce development, saying, "Both the opportunities for youth, for good workforce, and again, for New Mexico to participate in the project explosion that's happening around the country and around the world."
Conversely, a concerned resident argued, "It's just going to be another hazard. We already have the land field, we have a power plant, we have a cycle. They just come, private companies come, make money and they do. It's just a hazard."
According to the project website, Project Jupiter and Stargate promise to:
- Limit water use to domestic employee needs
- Build and supply their own power
- Invest up to $165 billion in Doña Ana County
- Deliver $300 million in direct payments to the county
- Create over 2,500+ construction jobs and 750+ permanent jobs
Despite these assurances, many in the community remain vigilant, watching to see if these promises are fulfilled once construction begins.
