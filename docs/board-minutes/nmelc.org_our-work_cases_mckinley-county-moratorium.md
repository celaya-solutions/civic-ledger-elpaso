Case Work: Land
McKinley County Moratorium on Uranium Mining
LOCATION: McKinley County, NM
INITIATION DATE: August 2013
CLIENTS/PARTNERS: Eastern Navajo Dine Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM), Red Water Pond Road Community Association
OPPOSING PARTIES: Uranium Industry
STATUS: Ongoing
ATTORNEYS: Eric Jantz
SUMMARY:
Site of the first uranium deposit discovered in the U.S., McKinley County continues to grapple with massive contamination left over from the Cold War-era uranium mining boom. As companies seek to return to the region, residents want the County to put a temporary moratorium on new mining until data can be collected on existing contamination and public health impacts. NMELC and its clients were unsuccessful in their first bid to introduce an ordinance to the County Commission, but have not given up their efforts.
