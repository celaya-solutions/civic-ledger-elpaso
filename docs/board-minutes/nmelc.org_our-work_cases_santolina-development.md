Case Work: Water
Santolina Proposed Development
LOCATION: Albuquerque, NM
INITIATION DATE: December 2014
CLIENTS/PARTNERS: Southwest Organizing Project, New Mexico Health Equity Working Group, Pajarito Village Association, South Valley Coalition of Neighborhood Associations, Center for Social Sustainable Systems, South Valley Regional Association of Acequias, and several individuals
OPPOSING PARTIES: Bernalillo County Planning Commission
STATUS: Ongoing

SUMMARY:
If built today, the 90,000-person Santolina development would be the third largest city in New Mexico. It would require nearly 20 million gallons of water per day, at least 20 schools, and two interchanges on I-40. Unfortunately, politicians have approved Santolina’s first level of approvals – despite the fact that developers have failed to show where they will get their water and how they will construct this massive undertaking without cost to Bernalillo taxpayers. “Santolina” is a complex set of cases related to different levels of the planning approval process. Cases involve: the Zone Map Amendment; the Level A Master Plan (Level A is the entire 13,000 acre site); the Level B.1 master plan (the B level is for discrete parts of the overall development covering several thousand acres); the Development Agreement for provision of water and wastewater. These cases are in various stages in District Court and the state Court of Appeals.
