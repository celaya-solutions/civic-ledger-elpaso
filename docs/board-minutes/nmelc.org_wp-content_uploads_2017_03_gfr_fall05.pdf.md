Much of the attention that has been brought to bear on the
environmental damage caused by oil and gas extraction,
including coal bed methane development, has been focused on
the contamination of ground water caused by oil and gas
operations. That attention is appropriate because of the seri-
ousness of that contamination and the importance of ground
water to New Mexico, a state in which 9 out of 10 people get
their drinking water from ground water. In the 2006 legislative
session that begins in January, however, the New Mexico
Legislature will take up legislation that addresses another
significant problem cause by oil and gas operations, damage to
the surface of the ground where oil and gas reserves

For more than ten years, the Helena Chemical Corporation
operated a chemical fertilizer facility in Mesquite (near Las
Cruces) without the proper air quality permit. Thus, there
were no parameters or limits in regards to air pollution for
the company's facility within the community. Fugitive dust
from fertilizer chemicals affected families whose homes lay
right outside the Helena boundaries. Children would come
to school with stinging eyes and throats due to clouds of
anhydrous ammonia coming down around them.
For years, the residents of Mesquite complained about the
Helena facility. For years nothing was done. Then in
November, 2005, the town's voice was heard and
brought results in the form of both a strong air quality
permit, a side agreement between Mesquite and
Helena, and a settlement for violation of the State air
quality act.
Arturo Uribe, one of the leaders of the Mesquite
Community Action Committee (MCAC), lives right next to
the Helena facility and hired the Law Center to represent
MCAC in its struggle for a clean environment.
“We live in a community of people of four different colors
who had not been listened to but are now being listened to,”
Uribe said. “People thought we were crazy, troublemakers.
But what our elders have been saying, what my neighbors
have been saying has been validated.”
Through the efforts of the Law Center and MCAC, a settle-
ment was reached for an air quality permit for the Helena
facility which includes conditions that will directly benefit
Mesquite. Furthermore, a permit will require Helena to keep
records, provide regular reports to the New Mexico
Environment Department, perform periodic monitoring and
be subject to unannounced inspections.

2 CASE UUPDATES
Surface OOwners’ PProtection
Act, CONTINUED
are located. A bill that was sponsored by
Representative Andy Nunez in the 2005 legisla-
tive session would have provided protection for
the owners of lands that include subsurface
minerals owned by oil and gas companies.
Representative Nunez has first-hand experience
with the development of such minerals because
his family’s lands were seriously damaged by an
oil and gas operator who was developing miner-
als located beneath those lands. Representative
Nunez’s legislation, which is expected to be
introduced again in the 2006 session, would
require that an oil and gas operator provide
notice to the owner of the surface lands , and
would mandate that the oil and gas operator
compensate the surface owner for
damage to the surface
lands as well as
for lost income
resulting from
the oil and
gas opera-
tor’s use of
the surface
to access
minerals. These requirements, which are not in
current law, would go a long way to protect the
rights of surface owners whose lands are
impacted by the development of subsurface
minerals.
Working with the New Mexico Cattle Growers
Association and the Oil and Gas Accountability
Project, the New Mexico Environmental Law
Center was one of the lead lobbyists for this
legislation during the 2005 legislative session,
when House Bill 1015 passed the State House
of Representatives and ran out of time in the
State Senate. We expect to be heavily involved
in the effort to enact similar legislation during
the 2006 session, and we look forward to work-
ing with our rancher and other allies on this
important issue.
Petroglyphs ssetback -- bbut ccase nnot oover
by Sarah Piltch, Staff Attorney
The Law Center filed a lawsuit in February 2005 against the City of Albuquerque to
stop the proposed extension of Paseo del Norte through the Las Imagines
Archeological District.
This summer, the City of Albuquerque brought a motion for summary judgment,
alleging that there were no issues of material fact for the court to determine, and
therefore the court should make a decision on the law. Law Center clients argued
that there were genuine issues of material fact yet to be determined including
whether the City's discussion of alternatives was adequate to support a decision to
build the proposed extension--i.e. whether there were prudent and feasible alterna-
tives to the alternative chosen, whether the alternative chosen would fulfill the
purpose of the project, whether the City’s environmental impact analysis was
flawed, whether the City conducted all possible planning to mitigate harm to the
district, and whether the city must perform a new environmental analysis.
After hearing oral argument on September 2, Judge Vanzi issued her decision on
the city's motion for summary judgment on October 11. Although the decision
did not end the lawsuit, it constituted a major set-back in the case for Law
Center clients.
Judge Vanzi found that the City acted within the scope of its authority and could
have reasonably believed that there was no feasible and prudent alternative, and/or
that the other alternative road alignments presented unique problems. However, she
also ruled that under the regulations, the city must undergo all possi ble planning to
preserve and protect and minimize harm to the site.
Although she decided against the plaintiffs on the question of prudent and feasible
alternatives, Judge Vanzi was troubled by the city’s behavior towards the pueblos.
SAGE Council has advocated for the city to engage in tribal consultation with all
affected tribes, particularly before the state Cultural Properties Review Committee.
Mesquite VVictory, CONTINUED
In addition, the Law Center helped broker a side agreement between MCAC and
Helena which provides for regular meetings between the community and the
industry to discuss activities at the facility and concerns of the community.
Finally, because the facility acted out of compliance, it was fined $202,500 by the
New Mexico Environment Department. Through efforts from the Law Center and
MCAC, most of the funds will be distributed directly to the community to
benefit Mesquite.
As some members of Mesquite have noted, these settlements are only the begin-
ning. MCAC is hoping to look into ground water issues related to the Helena
facility.
“We're watching now and Helena knows, the State knows,” said Uribe. “People ask
me what we've gotten out of this. The biggest thing, the most important thing is
that they’ve listened to us. For once this County and this State have listened to us.”
See www.nmenvirolaw.org for more details about the settlement.

CASE UUPDATES 3
In her decision, Judge Vanzi noted that “the way in which the record has been presented
leads the Court to believe there has been little action on the part of the City to substan-
tively reach out to the Pueblos as sovereign governments, resulting in the appearance of
insensitivity to the people who hold the land most sacred.” At this time, our clients are
weighing their options as to their next step.
The fight against Hydro Resources, Inc. (HRI) and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) to protect the groundwater in Crownpoint and Church Rock from
uranium contamination continues. On July 20, the NRC judge presiding over the case, E.
Roy Hawkens, rejected all of our client’s arguments regarding HRI’s inability to prevent
contamination of the Crownpoint and Church Rock water supplies. Essentially, our techni-
cal experts testified that underground stream channels in the aquifer would prevent HRI
from containing its uranium-contaminated water within its property boundaries, which
would result in toxics spreading into adjacent underground sources of drinking water.
Additionally, our experts testified that once the groundwater is contaminated, it cannot be
restored to pre-mining conditions.
Judge Hawkens found that HRI’s expert testimony, given by executives and managers in
the company, was more credible than the testimony presented by our clients’ expert
witnesses. Ironically, shortly before the judge issued his decision, the U.S. Geological
Survey published a draft report, commissioned by the NRC, which supports our clients’
position that HRI will be unable to remediate the groundwater after mining.
The Law Center has appealed this decision and a decision regarding cultural properties to
the full Commission.

Law CCenter BBiannual RReport, JJuly 22003 - JJune 22005
NNOOTTEE FFRROOMM TTHHEE PPRREESSIIDDEENNTT
I joined the Law Center's Board in 1997. That year I wrote in the Law
Center's newsletter that ‘many Indian tribes…don't feel they can have
an effect on environmental issues and they feel they are at the mercy of
the federal laws and Congress and the administration and the courts
because they don't understand the process. This is where the Law
Center-people who are dedicated and who know the process, who are
experts and know the language-are so important to Indian tribes and
other communities….The Law Center enhances the ability of the tribes
to set up internal mechanisms to develop and use laws for our own
protection, to protect our sacred areas, our water, our land and
anything else of value to the tribe.’
Those words are as true today as the day I wrote them.
But Native American communities are not the only ones that benefit
from the work of the Law Center, and the organization's impact is not
localized to the communities in which the Law Center specifically
works. I know that without the Law Center, our water would be more
contaminated, our air would be dirtier, our state's residents would be
sicker, and our ancient cultures would be more damaged. All of us who
live in this beautiful, but often shabbily-treated state, benefit from the
Law Center's ability to protect the world we share.
If you already support the Law Center's work, I thank you for helping
this extraordinary group of people continue their work on behalf of
New Mexico's communities and environment; the Law Center cannot
operate without you. If you are new to the Law Center, I urge you to
become a long-time supporter; I am proud to be a part of one of the
oldest and most respected independent environmental organizations in
New Mexico, and hope that you will be as well.

Church Rock & Crownpoint proposed uranium mines
Clients: Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM) and the
Southwest Research and Information Center (SRIC)
Objective: to stop proposed in situ leach uranium mining in the Navajo commu-
nities of the Crownpoint-Church Rock region. This mining would likely
contaminate the sole source of drinking water for 15,000 residents in the region.

the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Diné Natural Resources Protection Act (DNRPA), Navajo Nation*
Clients: ENDAUM and SRIC
Objective: implementation of a law that would ban uranium mining on Navajo
lands.
Outccome: The Navajo Nation passed the DNRPA in the spring of 2005. The
law bans underground/open pit uranium mining, and places a 50 year morato-
rium on in situ leach uranium mining in Navajo Indian Country - the first law
of its kind in the U.S. We anticipate that the uranium industry will appeal this law.
New Mexico uranium groundwater standards*
Client: ENDAUM
Objective: to lower New Mexico's uranium groundwater standard from 5,000
micrograms/liter of groundwater to 30 micrograms/liter.
Update:  The State adopted the new health-based standard in 2004; the oil and
gas industry and mining industry are appealing the decision.
Oil and gas leasing, Counselor Chapter, Navajo Nation*
Client: Counselor Chapter 
Objective: To prevent the leasing of lands historically, culturally, religiously and
environmentally important to the Navajo People for oil and gas development.

Client: Taos Pueblo
Objective: to prevent the expansion of the Taos Municipal Airport
Update: The Pueblo is working with a technical expert to analyze the Federal
Aviation Administration's draft environmental impact statement for the  expansion.
U.S. Hill mica mine, Picuris Pueblo*
Client: Picuris Pueblo
Objective: to stop the expansion of a mica mine on Picuris aboriginal lands
Outcome: Through a negotiated settlement, Picuris Pueblo regained the

ancient pottery tradition, which relies upon clay gathered at the site.
Update: The Pueblo's aboriginal title claim against the previous owner continues.
SSoolliidd WWaassttee CCaasseess
Southwest Landfill proposed expansion, South Valley, Albuquerque*
Client: South Valley Coalition of Neighborhood Associations (SVCNA), the
SouthWest Organizing Project (SWOP)
Objective: Stop the expansion of the Southwest Landfill in a neighborhood
already burdened with environmentally-degrading industries.
Update: In December 2004, the Law Center was handed a victory by the New
Mexico District Court when the judge overturned the landfill's permit to
expand. The company has appealed.
Rhino Environmental Services proposed landfill, Chaparral*
Client: SVCNA
Outcome: filed a friend of the court brief in support of a case brought by the
Colonias Development Council and argued before the NM Supreme Court
that community testimony and impacts on the community should be consid-
ered when the NM Environment Department makes permitting decisions
about solid waste facilities. The Court ruled in our favor, and the hearing in
the Chaparral case will be reopened.
New Mexico Amendment of Solid Waste Management Regulations
Clients: SWOP and South Valley Coalition of Neighborhood Associations
Objective: To obtain environmental justice provisions in the NM Solid Waste
Regulations, specifically to prevent the over-concentration of solid waste facili-
ties in communities, and to avoid disparate impacts on low-income
