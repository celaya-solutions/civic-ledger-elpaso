Dear Community,
This year officially marks the New Mexico Environmental Law Center’s 35th Year Anniversary!  Since NMELC first opened its doors in 1987, thanks to your ongoing support, we have continued to work in partnership with clients and communities on some of the most significant environmental cases protecting air, water and land across New Mexico, including state-level greenhouse gas emission limits, radioactive air and water pollution from uranium mines/mills, sprawl development, asphalt plant emissions, and advocacy for air quality rules at the state and local levels that protect all New Mexican communities. As we continue our journey, NMELC reaffirms its deep commitment to authentically integrating equity across our entire organization, from our board governance to our programs and legal services. During our strategic planning session held this past summer, NMELC formalized the integration of movement lawyering as a guiding framework for our organization. 
“Movement lawyering means taking direction from directly impacted communities and from organizers, as opposed to imposing our leadership or expertise as legal advocates. It means building the power of the people, not the power of the law” (American Bar Association, 2021). We are proud to share that NMELC will be the o n l y  environmental justice focused nonprofit law center in the state to integrate movement lawyering across its entire organization.  With our 35 years of service in mind, it is with much pride we present our latest Green Fire Report that includes updates on some of our most active cases: the continued battle against the Santolina Master Plan; the unprecedented decision of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights declaring ENDAUM’s petition admissible; highlighting the vital work of one of our newest clients— Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium; among other updates provided by our dedicated legal team.
We take a moment to recognize that our work would not be possible without the support of long-term and new donors whose financial contributions help our organization take on these challenging and precedent-setting environmental justice cases that often take several years if not decades to complete. 
All of us at NMELC thank you for believing in the importance of our work and for helping to uphold environmental justice across our state! I hope you enjoy reading our Green Fire Report and here’s to the next 35 years of history making at NMELC!
In solidarity,

NEW MEXICO ENVIRONMENTAL LAW CENTER 
BY: VIRGINIA NECOCHEA, PHD


In addition, the BCC recently considered the Bernalillo County Planning Commission’s (CPC) recommendation to deny 
the Amended Level A and Level B.II Master Plans on August 16, 2022. This hearing presented many procedural issues 
for the community, including dysfunctional sign-up procedures and hybrid meeting format plus uncertainty around the 
rules the BCC was following throughout the hearing. Most importantly, the hearing should never have taken place 
because no party officially appealed the CPC recommendation. Despite these issues and the fact that the plans enable the 
developer to move forward with the project without securing a water service provider in a time of increasing water 
scarcity, the BCC voted to approve both plans. 
On behalf of our clients, NMELC has filed suit to challenge the BCC’s decision in order to safeguard the due process 
rights of the community and ensure that the County provides the public with a just and equitable process. Working 
together with community members, we have successfully delayed this unneeded and unwanted development project for 
more than 9 years. We will continue to protect the precious water resources of the Middle Rio Grande and the South 
Valley’s agricultural traditions from being exploited by developers’ greed.
Since 2015, NMELC has partnered with clients and communities in a battle to protect the limited water resources of the 
Middle Rio Grande region. The original Santolina development plan called for 37,000 homes for approximately 95,000 
people that would use more than 3.8 billion gallons of water per year. However, the developers have never been able to 
obtain the required water availability agreement from the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority. On 
August 25, 2021, the Bernalillo County Board of County Commissioners (BCC or Board) voted to approve the Santolina 
developer’s requested Zone Map Amendment, which the developers (Western Albuquerque Land Holdings, LLC and 
Consensus Planning, Inc.) must have in place in order to build anything on the Santolina property, a massive housing 
development proposed on Albuquerque’s West Mesa.
 
This was the Board’s second time hearing arguments related to the Zone Map Amendment – the BCC first approved the 
Amendment in 2015, but that decision was reversed by the Court because it violated the due process rights of the 
community. NMELC, on behalf of the SouthWest Organizing Project, the Pajarito Village Association, and a few 
individuals, appealed the BCC’s 2021 decision to the Second Judicial District Court on September 24, 2021, again 
asking the Court to review whether, in voting to approve the Zone Map Amendment, the BCC once again violated the 
due process rights of the community. The District Court ultimately upheld the BCC’s approval of the Zone Map 
Amendment on July 29, 2022. Unfortunately, with the Zone Map Amendment in place, the developers are one step 
closer to building a sprawl development at the expense of Bernalillo County residents’ quality of life.

Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining
Since 1994, members of the Diné communities of Crownpoint and Churchrock have been resisting planned uranium 
mining that would destroy valuable drinking water sources where they live. The mining company, Laramide Resources, 
has secured all its necessary federal permits, and appeals filed by Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining 
(ENDAUM) in federal courts have been fruitless. In 2011, ENDAUM filed the first ever petition alleging human rights 
violations against the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for its uranium development policies and practices, which
continue to disproportionately impact communities of color, especially Indigenous communities. The petition was 
accepted in 2021, and since then ENDAUM and NMELC have been filing additional evidence supporting their human 
rights abuse allegations. Because of its historic disdain for international human rights law, the U.S. government 
refused to submit its own evidence on the merits. Most recently, ENDAUM and NMELC asked the Commission to 
make an expedited decision on their Petition merits because the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act has numerous 
provisions that will incentivize domestic uranium production, putting their communities in imminent danger. Once the 
aquifer—their principal source of drinking water—is contaminated by uranium mining, it can never be remediated.

 Red Water Pond Road Community Association
The Red Water Pond Road Community Association continues to struggle against federal regulatory agencies that want to 
keep radioactive and toxic waste produced by two historic uranium mines and one uranium mill in this small Diné 
community, rather than move it out of Navajo Indian Country. The U.S. EPA and NRC plan to bury waste from one of the
mine sites on top of waste from the mill less than a mile from peoples’ homes. On Earth Day this year, the Red Water 
Pond Road Community hosted the three sitting NRC commissioners to personally demand that the NRC reconsider 
its ill-advised plan. Gale-force winds whipped radioactive dust through the gathering, emphasizing the dangers the 
community faces on a regular basis. Soon after the Commissioners’ visit, the NRC announced it was putting its 
permitting process on hold to re-evaluate the situation. This unprecedented step would not have been possible without 
community engagement and support of allies like the NMELC.  
 
Homestake Barrick Gold Superfund Site
BY ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & MIA MONTOYA HAMMERSLEY, STAFF 
ATTORNEY
The Homestake uranium mill, a designated Superfund site, is a relic of cold war uranium production that has continued 
to affect groundwater quality and community health for over 30 years since it stopped production. Despite Homestake's 
groundwater remediation efforts—supervised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission—the groundwater contamination from the mill has actually gotten worse. Now, Homestake is signaling 
that it will apply to the EPA and NRC to walk away from the site without further groundwater restoration 
efforts. NMELC and our clients intend to hold Homestake and regulatory agencies accountable to ensure that 
groundwater is returned to pre-mining quality. This case has recently received a higher profile thanks to in-depth 
coverage in national media. NMELC continues to support our clients in meeting with regulating agencies and monitoring 
Homestake's activities. 

After years of fighting a proposed asphalt batch plant proposed for their community, the Mountain View Coalition 
(Mountain View Neighborhood Association, Mountain View Community Action, and Friends of Valle de Oro National 
Wildlife Refuge) may be near the end of its struggle. For decades, the Mountain View neighborhood in Albuquerque’s 
South Valley has been the location where Albuquerque and Bernalillo County have steered industries that emit air 
pollution. As a result, Mountain View and adjacent communities have become overburdened by polluting industries, 
which have had a significant impact on community members’ health. In fact, the life expectancy in Mountain View is 
significantly lower than in other Albuquerque neighborhoods due to pollution. The proposed New Mexico Terminal 
Services asphalt plant would emit tons of dangerous chemicals and fine particulate matter, but the City of Albuquerque 
Environmental Health Department granted the plant’s permit application anyway. The Mountain View Coalition 
appealed the Department’s decision to the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board, and in early 
September, the Hearing Officer on the case recommended the Air Board send the permit back to the Department 
for reconsideration. The Board will vote on the Hearing Officer’s recommendation in October just after this goes to 
print. The Mountain View Coalition will continue to pressure the Department to reverse its earlier decision and take an 
important step in decreasing Mountain View’s pollution burden.

Cumulative Air Impact Regulation
 
Cumulative impacts—that is, the consideration of environmental and social impacts on a community holistically—have 
been called the Holy Grail of environmental justice. Low-income communities and communities of color have 
traditionally been the dumping grounds for society’s polluting industries. Albuquerque is no different, with 
industries that generate air pollution, such as asphalt plants, concrete plants, and hydrocarbon storage facilities, 
proliferating in a few working class, BIPOC communities. A coalition of groups from disproportionately impacted 
communities has begun, with NMELC assistance, to draft a regulation that would force industry and regulatory agencies 
to take into account the health and environmental impacts of air pollution from existing and anticipated facilities when 
evaluating new air pollution permit applications. The regulation will be a significant step in protecting the health of 
already overburdened communities.

In July 2021, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) issued an air pollution permit to Associated Asphalt and 
Materials, LLC (AAM) for the consolidation of two hot mix asphalt batch plant facilities on Santa Fe’s Southside. The 
permit allows the plant to operate up to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during certain parts of the year and does not protect 
the health of the public with any certainty. The plant is near multiple neighborhoods where most industrial facilities in 
Santa Fe are located, primarily made up of lower-income, young, Spanish-speaking families. 
 
Our clients, Earth Care New Mexico and Linda Marianiello, appealed NMED’s decision to issue the permit to the 
Environmental Improvement Board and had a three-day hearing last February. On May 27, 2022 the Hearing Officer 
issued his report and recommendation, agreeing with the community and recommending that the Environmental 
Improvement Board reverse NMED’s decision to issue an air pollution permit to AAM. The Hearing Officer determined 
that the community met its burden of proof and demonstrated that, as permitted, the AAM facility would cause or 
contribute to violations of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which would negatively impact the health and 
quality of life of the surrounding community.

The Copper Flat Mine is a proposed open-pit copper mine near Hillsboro in Sierra County, which would be operated by New 
Mexico Copper Corporation. Mining operations could contaminate groundwater and surface water and severely 
deplete groundwater in the Lower Rio Grande Basin in a time of increasing water scarcity due to climate change. The 
mine will also leave behind a large pit lake that will exceed water quality standards. NMELC is representing a coalition of 
ranches, local watershed associations, and environmental groups in a proceeding before the New Mexico Office of the State 
Engineer, where our clients have protested the transfer of water rights to the mine that would harm our water resources and 
enable polluting mining operations to move forward.

 On June 24, 2022, the Environmental Improvement Board sided with 
NMED and the status quo, at the cost of the community.
 
Despite the Hearing Officer’s recommendation, which validated community concerns, on June 24, 2022, the 
Environmental Improvement Board voted to set it aside, siding with NMED and the status quo, at the cost of the
community. Our clients have decided not to appeal this decision to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, and are instead 
developing a robust environmental justice campaign to best serve Santa Fe’s Southside residents and challenge the broader 
systemic issues that contribute to the environmental racism in Santa Fe. NMELC will continue to work alongside the 
community in their fight however we are needed, providing legal assistance and advocacy while the community leads the 
way.

Augustin Plains Ranch Groundwater Transfer
BY MASLYN LOCKE, STAFF ATTORNEY 
Since 2007, the Law Center has represented community members and groups near Datil, New Mexico, in their protest 
against the transfer of 54,000 acre feet/year of groundwater by Augustin Plains Ranch. Datil is halfway between Pie Town 
and the Very Large Array. The Ranch proposes to transport the groundwater out of Catron County to various counties across 
New Mexico via a 140-mile pipeline for use by unidentified municipal or commercial users, impacting rural water users and 
exposing communities to potential water mining that could change the future of water management in New Mexico. The 
State Engineer has denied the Ranch’s application twice since 2007 because the Ranch has been unable to identify any 
clearly beneficial use for the water, relying entirely on hypothetical future uses that are detrimental to the community
currently relying on the water. In 2019, the District Court upheld the decision of the State Engineer to deny the Ranch’s 
application because the Ranch was attempting, for the second time, to appropriate groundwater for unspecified purposes to 
the detriment of current water users. On August 11, 2022, the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the 
District Court, holding that the District Court’s decision to dismiss the Ranch’s case was unfair to the Ranch and an 
abuse of the Court’s discretion. A small group of protestants, along with Catron County, have appealed the decision to the 
New Mexico Supreme Court, asking the Court to reverse the Court of Appeals decision and address the Court’s failure to 
address whether the State Engineer’s decision to deny the Ranch’s application due to its speculative nature was appropriate. 
The Ranch has also appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, requesting the Court order the State Engineer to allow them 
an additional hearing on the application. 
NMELC represents the Upper Pecos Watershed Association, which works in coalition with several other groups including 
the New Mexico Acequia Association, the New Mexico Acequia Commission, the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance and 
many individuals, in the fight against the exploration and proposed mining operation near Tererro, New Mexico, in the 
Upper Pecos watershed. Both the exploration and mining would impact traditional farmers in the Pecos who depend on the 
river to feed their families and community. A Colorado subsidiary of an Australian mining company, Co-Mexico, LLC, is 
seeking to drill 30 exploratory holes in and around the Pecos Watershed, risking contamination of the river and degradation 
of the surrounding area, in search of gold, copper and zinc. On July 12, 2022, the Water Quality Control Commission ruled 
that the northern part of the Pecos River, along with over 125 miles of rivers in Northern New Mexico, were designated as 
Outstanding National Resource Waters, adding an important layer of protection to the river. We are also currently waiting 
for the US Forest Service to issue an Environmental Assessment related to the proposed drilling, a process that has been 
delayed by the effects of the Hermit's Peak and Calf Canyon fires that burned over 341,000 acres in the area and has 
impacted many community members. Given the already existing impacts of the old Tererro mine and the largest wildfire 
in New Mexico history, plus impacts from any proposed mining in the area, the community is united in its opposition to the 
Tererro mine, and NMELC will continue working with clients and community in their fight.

“We had casualties from Trinity and they were our babies. Babies died and the Federal 
Government looked the other way. They had an opportunity to intervene when contacted by a 
health care worker who asked for assistance as an unusually high number of babies were dying. 
For me this is the most egregious part of the Trinity history. It is unconscionable that our own 
government let our babies die and that people, families suffered through the loss.”

NMELC is representing the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium (TBDC), which was founded to advocate for and 
compile data on the cancers and other diseases that plague the communities impacted by the Trinity Nuclear Test of July 16, 
1945. The Downwinders successfully advocated for legislation extending the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act 
(RECA) for two years, which provides an opportunity to expand eligibility for compensation under RECA to downwinder 
communities in the Tularosa Basin. NMELC is currently assisting TBDC with gathering additional information about the 
Trinity Nuclear Test through Freedom of Information Requests. 
Seeking justice for the unknowing, unwilling, and 
uncompensated, innocent victims of the July 16, 1945, 
Trinity Test in South Central New Mexico
TBDC is doing a deep dive into uncovering exactly what happened with the infant mortality after the Trinity test. 
Kathleen M. Tucker and Robert Alvarez published a paper on this entitled “Trinity: The Most Significant Hazard of 
the Entire Manhattan Project” on July 15, 2019 in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Steering Committee member 
Bernice Gutierrez has done most of the research. She was born in Carrizozo 8 days before the bomb was detonated 
and is one of the children who survived. More than 40 members of her family either got cancer or survived radiation 
exposure illnesses. She is trying to access death records from the State Archives but it has not been easy to obtain 
them; TBDC is now enlisting the help of some of our State Legislators to do so.
