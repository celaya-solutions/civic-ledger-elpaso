Dear Supporters,
I am happy to present to you the latest issue of our Green Fire Report – New MexicoEnvironmental Law Center’s biannual publication providing readers with timelyupdates on our most active cases from across the state. 
This year marks 38 years that NMELC has worked alongside frontline clients andimpacted communities to protect New Mexico’s air, land, and water in the fight forenvironmental justice. We continue to be the only public interest nonprofit law centerin New Mexico focused on environmental justice legal work and one of few acrossthe nation representing clients fighting against the toxic legacy of uranium mining. 
Although the work of NMELC has always been instrumental in advancing anddemanding justice, the current historical moment has made our legal serviceseven more critical and urgently needed. 
Since January 20, on an almost daily basis, we continue to witness attacks wieldedagainst our democracy, on our human rights, and the unjust targeting of communitieswho have already faced great oppression in our country. This targeting has beenrelentless and is personal because it includes our families, neighbors, allies, clients,and nonprofits.
The reality we are facing feels grim under this administration with extractive miningbeing prioritized and fast tracked with minimal environmental review; with nonprofitstatuses being scrutinized and questioned; with the possible repeal of environmentalregulations meant to protect us; among others. All of these threats place the health andwell-being of everyone and especially our clients and frontline communities at greaterrisk. 
We will not stand back and watch from the sidelines. We have and will continue tostand alongside our clients and targeted communities in protecting human rights andeveryone’s right to clean air, land, and water. Rest assured that we are spending thetime and resources needed to continuously strategize on how we can and will usethe rule of law to defend and best protect our clients, families, and communitiesfrom injustices and harm. 
Our focus remains on our environmental justice legal work and representing ourfrontline clients who continue to bear the burden stemming from pollution and toxicindustry, but during this onslaught of attacks, it is vital that all of us in the socialjustice movement become a united and collective force. That is how we willprevail.
It is our hope that we can count on your continued support especially during theseintense times. Every nonprofit, including ours, will depend on supporters to seeus through. We are grateful to say that our people have supported our organizationfor three decades. We are deeply grateful for your commitment to seeking justice,especially for those who have carried the heavy weight of oppression for too long. 
We hope you enjoy reading our latest case updates and THANK YOU for supportingour law center so we can continue to focus on our vital work ensuring New Mexicansare safe, are well, and are entitled to their fundamental human right to clean air, land,and water.
In solidarity,
Dr. Virginia Necochea

NEW MEXI CO ENVI RONMENTAL LAW CENTER 
BY VIRGINIA NECOCHEA, PHD

 On January 17, 2025, EPA accepted the Civil Rights Complaint for
investigation to determine, “whether the actions of the City Council
surrounding the Air Board’s rulemaking proceeding and issuance of the
HEEI Rule discriminated against persons in Albuquerque on the basis of
race, color and national origin, in violation of Title VI”
On May 31, 2024, NMELC and the Mountain View Coalition filed a Title VI Complaint with the United States Environmental
Protection Agency’s (EPA) External Office of Civil Rights Compliance, alleging that the City of Albuquerque and its City
Council violated Coalition members’ civil rights when the Albuquerque City Council interfered with the December 2023 HEEI
Rulemaking. 
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC § 2000(d) et seq., and EPA’s nondiscrimination regulation, 40 C.F.R. Part 7,
prohibit the City of Albuquerque and its City Council, as recipients of federal funding, from discriminating against individuals
on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the City violated Coalition members’ civil
rights when the City Council passed legislation in an unlawful attempt to purge the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality
Control Board and place a moratorium on the Board’s ability to take action during the HEEI rulemaking hearing. 
The Mountain View Coalition asked EPA to: 
1) Conduct an investigation into the City of Albuquerque and its City Council’s discriminatory conduct and interference in the
HEEI Rulemaking; 2) Hold a public listening session and an opportunity for community members to submit comments on the
City’s discriminatory actions; 3) If warranted, reduce or eliminate federal funding for the City of Albuquerque; and 4) Take all
other actions to ensure that the City and its Council come into and remain in Compliance with Title VI. 
On January 17, 2025, EPA accepted the Civil Rights Complaint for investigation to determine, “whether the actions of the City
Council surrounding the Air Board’s rulemaking proceeding and issuance of the HEEI Rule discriminated against persons in
Albuquerque on the basis of race, color and national origin, in violation of Title VI …” This decision by EPA was great news
for community members and a small but important environmental justice victory.
Since the promulgation of the Health, Environment and Equity Impacts (HEEI) Rule in December 2023, members of the
Mountain View Coalition, made up of the Mountain View Neighborhood Association, Mountain View Community Action and
Friends of Valle de Oro, along with NMELC, continue to fight for environmental justice and clean air in Albuquerque and
Bernalillo County. 
As we’ve previously shared, what started out as one rulemaking has proliferated into three district court lawsuits, two cases in
the Court of Appeals, multiple civil rights complaints and continuous engagement with the City of Albuquerque
Environmental Health Department (EHD) and its implementation of the rule.
Mountain View Coalition/HEEI Title VI Complaint
CASE UPDATES
BY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & KACEY
HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY 


The Mountain View Coalition, through an Inspection of Public Records Act request, obtained the City’s response to MVC’s
Complaint, in which the City makes several frivolous arguments, ultimately claiming that EPA cannot investigate the Council for
its discriminatory acts because it is inexplicably not required to comply with civil rights laws. But the City of Albuquerque and its
City Council are not immune from, nor above, federal law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color and national
origin. The Coalition has provided EPA with written comments supporting EPA’s authority to investigate the City and correcting
the City’s many incorrect factual assertions. 
The Mountain View Coalition continues to engage with EPA to provide information that better informs the investigation of the
City of Albuquerque, and remains hopeful that EPA will issue a finding of discrimination against the City to ensure the City
comes into compliance with its obligation to respect community members’ civil rights. 
The Coalition also submitted a Request for Compliance Review of EHD, asking EPA to thoroughly investigate and review
EHD’s compliance with Title VI. EHD has an ongoing and extensive history of civil rights violations. During the HEEI
proceedings, EHD discriminated against communities of color by failing to provide logistical support to the Air Board as the New
Mexico Air Quality Control Act requires and consistently collaborating with polluting industry to undermine the community’s
effort to improve air quality. 
EHD was previously the subject of a similar Title VI Complaint filed in 2014, when community groups submitted a complaint as
a result of EHD’s failure to consider the cumulative impacts of health factors, social factors, and additional air pollution burdens
in already overburdened areas and EHD’s pattern and practice of discriminatory air pollution permitting. EPA has also accepted
an additional Title VI Complaint for investigation, filed on May 30, 2024 by community allies Los Jardines Institute and the
Natural Resources Defense Council, for EHD’s discriminatory conduct during the HEEI rulemaking. 
Our legal work alongside the Mountain View Coalition is a fight against environmental racism and for stronger regulations to
better protect community members’ health. 
In addition to the lawsuits pending before the district court and the Civil Rights complaints, National Technology and Engineering
Solutions of Sandia (NTESS), a subsidiary of Honeywell International and the contractor that operates Sandia National Lab, and a
group of industry permittees, appealed the HEEI Rule the Air Board adopted to the New Mexico Court of Appeals. The industry
groups assert, among other things, that the Air Board did not have the authority to adopt the rule. The Mountain View Coalition
intervened in the appeal of the HEEI Rule to defend the Rule’s validity. 
On April 2, 2025, NMELC filed two Answer Briefs with the Court of Appeals, responding to both NTESS and a set of industry
groups, including Albuquerque Asphalt, Black Rock Services, Mountain States Construction and the New Mexico Chamber of
Commerce. Both Answers support the Air Board’s authority to adopt the HEEI Rule, as well as clearly articulate the scientific and
technical evidence supporting the requirements of the HEEI Rule itself. While some additional briefing may occur, the Mountain
View Coalition now awaits a decision from the Court of Appeals and is hopeful the Court will uphold the Board’s decision to adopt
the HEEI Rule.

Two weeks after EPA’s visit, however, CRRUA again provided residents with discolored water for days. Reports of poor water
quality circulated from family homes and businesses alike, including the Sunland Park Senior Citizen Center.
Following the latest water quality crisis, on March 7, NMELC, alongside community members and advocates, submitted a list of
written demands to CRRUA, the City of Sunland Park, and Doña Ana County. The demands included that CRRUA establish
preventive and protective measures in the event of impacted water quality; provide arsenic testing strips and clean third-party
water to all households; implement a rate increase moratorium for the next four years; and make CRRUA’s public meetings more
accessible. Empowerment Congress, residents, and community advocates then made these demands clear at each public body’s
meetings in March, additionally requesting Doña Ana County Board Commissioner Gloria Gameros replace Commissioner
Shannon Reynolds on the CRRUA Board – which the County Board finalized on March 25. 
Community members and advocates continue to demand action, accountability, transparency, and change, and NMELC remains
committed to working alongside our clients and community members in the fight for clean and safe drinking water. 
In Southern New Mexico, Sunland Park and Santa Teresa residents, community advocates, a nonprofit organization called
Empowerment Congress, and NMELC continue to organize for consistently clean and safe drinking water. Following NMELC
and community members’ October 2024 meeting with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), NMELC, on behalf
of residents and community advocates, submitted a Formal Request to EPA to inspect the Camino Real Regional Utility
Authority (CRRUA) for compliance with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act on December 20, 2024. As a result, on February
4, 2025, EPA conducted an on-site inspection of CRRUA, and we continue to wait for EPA’s release of its inspection report.

Proposed Uranium Mining at La Jara Mesa/Roca Honda/
Crownpoint/Churchrock
BY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR & ANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY
With Executive Orders “unleashing” American energy “dominance” and directing the U.S. Department of Justice to evaluate state
and local laws that might stand in the way of unregulated energy mineral exploitation, with the goal of filing lawsuits to overturn
those laws, communities that have struggled under the weight of historic uranium extraction are again in the crosshairs. Because
Diné, Acoma, and Laguna communities are still contaminated from Cold War era mining, the federal government’s rush to
exploit minerals it designates as “critical,” such as uranium, is particularly concerning. The federal Executive Orders are intended
to significantly narrow public participation and input on uranium and other “critical” mineral projects.  
These unilateral executive actions, although likely illegal, could have significant effects on New Mexico communities. The
Executive Orders force federal agencies to cut corners with environmental, public health and cultural reviews and limit the ability
of affected communities to take legal action in response. Proposed conventional uranium mining projects at La Jara Mesa
(Laramide Resources) and Roca Honda (Energy Fuels) could be fast-tracked into development, while those projects’ effects on
precious water resources and Indigenous cultural values are minimized or ignored. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
likely to greenlight proposed In Situ Leach uranium mining in the Diné communities of Churchrock and Crownpoint, which will
put thousands of people’s future drinking water at risk.  
Fortunately, New Mexico has robust state laws to protect water and ensure that when mining occurs, it is done as responsibly as
possible. Alongside our clients, NMELC will take every measure necessary to ensure communities are protected from the
devastation that the uranium extraction industry has and will continue to cause. 


Red Water Pond Road Community/Quivira WasteRemoval Project
BY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY;
ANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY
Homestake Barrick Gold (Homestake) created a heavily contaminated uranium mill Superfund site five miles north of Milan, New
Mexico. The Homestake mill site is so contaminated that two federal agencies oversee the cleanup of the radioactive waste: the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the EPA. Homestake continues its incessant efforts to loosen or end the groundwater
cleanup requirements imposed by the NRC and the EPA.  
In 2023, Homestake applied to have “alternate concentration limits” of radioactive uranium approved by the NRC, which would,
if granted, significantly relax groundwater cleanup standards for uranium and other toxic heavy metals. Also, by expanding the
land boundaries at which uranium contamination levels are measured, Homestake anticipates its groundwater contamination will
spread and hopes to extend its “point of compliance” with New Mexico groundwater standards as far as it can. To support its
application, Homestake bought land and homes from private landowners downgradient of the mill site, essentially forcing them
out of the area so Homestake could more quickly cease its groundwater cleanup efforts. Many landowners sold to Homestake
because of economic pressures and the ongoing presence and long term reality of contaminated groundwater from the mill site. In
addition to its attempt with the NRC to abdicate responsibility for the contamination, Homestake also seeks an EPA waiver of its
standards by asserting it is “technically impractical” to clean up the groundwater to EPA’s current requirements. 
The Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment (MASE) community and the remaining landowners continue their unwavering
advocacy and scrutiny of these two applications and the studies being conducted by Homestake to support its attempts to lower or
end the NRC and EPA cleanup standards. 
When the U.S. EPA announced at the end of 2024 that it would be removing the waste from the historic Quivira uranium mine
out of the Red Water Pond Road community to a properly engineered site at the Red Rock Landfill property, community
members were thrilled. For the first time, the federal government had listened to a uranium impacted community’s wishes and
agreed to move waste offsite rather than bury it in place. However, as the New Year wore on, Red Water Pond Road community
members realized their fight wasn’t over.  
During New Mexico’s legislative session, Senator George Muñoz introduced legislation that would have prevented the New
Mexico state agencies from granting necessary permits to the Red Rock Landfill for mine waste disposal. Uranium impacted
communities from around the state turned out to testify against the proposed legislation, and during a committee hearing on
Muñoz’s bill, were stunned to learn the bill was drafted and introduced on behalf of the Navajo Nation who had previously
purported to support the uranium-impacted residents’ request. Rather than honor the will of its own people, the Navajo Nation
attempted to stop mine waste relocation in favor of “treating” the mine waste with experimental technology that could allegedly
benefit the Navajo Nation financially.  
Vocal opposition led the committee to table Senator Muñoz’s bill, but community members now have a renewed sense of
vigilance to stave off threats from the uranium mining industry, industry allies in the New Mexico government and their own
tribal government. The EPA recently confirmed it intends to move forward with the mine waste removal plans. The Red Water
Pond Road community, with the NMELC’s support, will continue to make sure the Quivira Mine waste is removed from its
community and stored in a facility that protects the air, land and water of all communities.

Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment (MASE)
NMELC has worked alongside MASE since its founding in 2008; NMELC Legal Director Eric Jantz in particular has worked
as the lead attorney working with MASE’s member groups, including Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining
(ENDAUM) and their ongoing petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Red Water Pond Road
Community Association’s long term efforts to move radioactive and mine waste of their lands, and Laguna-Acoma Coalition
for a Safe Environment’s work to protect Mount Taylor from additional uranium mining.
The Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment (MASE) is a coalition of communities in the southwestern United States
that seeks to address the lasting impacts of uranium mining while promoting environmental justice and the protection of public
health. Based in New Mexico, MASE works in partnership with community organizations to ensure a sustainable future for
impacted communities. 
“The positive impacts MASE has had on New Mexico communities is incalculable. MASE was founded to
bring diverse communities together over one issue - protecting communities from the harms of uranium
mining and processing. MASE continues to work with Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities alike to
protect public health, cultural values and the environment. MASE has become an irreplaceable counter to
corporate greed, political corruption and government overreach." 
—Eric Jantz
NMELC Legal Director


“NMELC staff attorney Ann McCartney has been an invaluable team player withMASE and the Bluewater Valley Downstream Alliance as they meet with regulatorsabout groundwater cleanup efforts and human health impacts at Homestake-BarrickGold's former uranium mill site near Grants, NM, while Legal Director Eric Jantzremains a stalwart defender of environmental justice communities seeking protectionfrom attempts to revive uranium mining around the sacred landscape of Mt. Taylor.” —Laura Watchempino Laguna-Acoma Coalition for a Safe Environment 
“The NMELC has been one of our strongest allies providing legal guidance as wechallenge policies and permits that would allow uranium mining and fail to protectour communities. NMELC’s invaluable guidance tracking legal issues and wadingthrough documents and technical data has enabled MASE members to addressenvironmental injustices. Many of our successes are a direct result of theinvolvement of the NMELC.” —Susan GordonMASE Coordinator 
“NMELC has been a critical part of the work of MASE. Their expertise allows us toengage on key issues affecting our communities. For example, they have met withregulators on the health impacts at Homestake-Barrick Gold's former uranium millsite by Grants, and have helped to protect the landscape near Mt. Taylor.” —Ava Curtis MASE Coordinator
