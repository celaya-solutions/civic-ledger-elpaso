In the last issue of the /g7/g37/g40/g40/g35/g41/g8/g33/g37/g40
/g4/g40/g31/g38/g37/g39, we told you about a
“zombie permit”for the proposed
Uranium Resources, Inc. (URI)
mine in Church Rock, NM.
Staffers at the New Mexico
Environment Department had
just renewed the permit – even
though the application was
submitted 19 years earlier.
Because of your support, Staff Attorney Eric Jantz immediately
filed an appeal on behalf of our long-standing client, the
Eastern Navajo Dine Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM).
Shortly 
thereafter, NMED Secretary Ryan Flynnterminated the
permit. In his letter, Flynn cited New Mexico’s groundwater
uranium standard, which was lowered in 2004 from 5,000
micrograms/liter to 30 micrograms/liter.

Our ally, the Multicultural
Alliance for a Safe Environment
(swuraniumimpacts.org)also
submitted comments on this 
permit earlier in the year.
The termination is a critical decision, because the mine cannot
open without this permit. But the case is not yet closed –
Flynn urged the company to submit a new application for
immediate review by the agency. Your support will ensure
that we, ENDAUM and MASE can keep challenging this project.

Case Updates
“When Respondents demand that 
the Court pay deference to the
Commission,they are actually
demanding that the C ourt pay
deference to F reeport McMoRan. ”
With your support, we filed our Reply Brief on March 7 in
the Copper Rule challenge before the state Supreme Court.
It’s one of our last steps before the state’s high court hands
down a ruling in a case that could decide how groundwater
is protected – or sacrificed – at industrial sites in New
Mexico for years to come. You can see the Reply Brief on
our website, nmelc.org.
Copper Rule moves one step 
closer to Supreme Court ruling
LANL put on notice
Following the Lab’ s failure to meet
a critical deadline, NukeWatch 
and NMELC prepare to sue.
Failure to clean up LANL’s radioactive and hazardous 
waste has real-life ramifications for New Mexicans. 
During major stormwater events, the City of Santa Fe 
has to close its water diversion on the Rio Grande 
because of plutonium contamination washing down from
Los Alamos Canyon. These and other problems will grow
as more pollution migrates toward the river.
That's one reason why, on January 20, the Law Center
and its client, Nuclear Watch (NukeWatch), put the U.S.
Department of Energy and Los Alamos National Laboratory
(LANL) on notice: we are preparing to sue the Lab for its
failure to comply with its mandated cleanup schedule,
and for its failure to allow for public comment and 
hearings on changes to cleanup deadlines required by 
a 2005 Consent Order.  
Law Center Staff Attorney Jon Block is co-counsel with
attorney John Stroud, an experienced trial attorney who
has provided assistance to NukeWatch New Mexico for
many years.
“We think that nothing less than the future 
of cleanup at the Los Alamos Lab is at 
stake in our litigation, ”says Jay Coghlan,
Executive Director of Nuclear Watch.
“We are deeply grateful to the Law Center 
for skillfully representing us in this 
demanding effort to achieve comprehensive 
cleanup at LANL.
”
The white domes at LANL contain Transuranic Waste, as well as equipment
for packaging or repackaging waste. 
Here’s what we and NukeWatch will ask a federal judge:
• force the Lab to obtain a legal extension for cleanup;
• mandate that the Lab follow the required public process 
as part of the extension;
• order that any changes to the cleanup schedule require
public participation.
We will file suit in March if NMED and LANL do not jump-
start the process to implement an extension, or if that process
fails to include a robust public component.

–NMELC Reply Brief, Copper Rule case
The Copper Rule allows New Mexico copper mines, including Freeport McMoRan's
Chino mine (pictured here), to pollute groundwater.

Alice van Buren
"You guys have a talent for optimism," says artist, writer,
filmmaker and playwright Alice van Buren in explaining
why she has been supporting the Law Center since 2009.
Alice was first introduced to the Law Center when we
were representing community residents fighting threatened
oil and gas extraction in the Galisteo Basin. Alice became
involved in the fight, organizing a colorful community
parade (complete with dinosaurs) against big oil, and
developing a miniature golf course installation called
“Gas Stations of the Cross”, where players putt from pump
to pump. Alice got so involved that she even served on
the Law Center's board of directors for a couple of years,
before returning full-time to
her creative work.
Educated at Harvard and
Brown, Alice studied painting
at the Rhode Island Schoolof
Design and then printmaking
in France. In Paris she also
worked as a journalist and
radio commentator. She
moved to New Mexico the
classic way – her car broke
down outside of Taos.
“Gas Stations of the Cross”
lives on, along with other art-
work, at the Sculpture Ranch,
which she established on the
outskirts of Santa Fe with her
husband and sculptor,
Nathaniel Hesse.
The 
compound is also inhabited
by several horses and one very sweet rescue dog. Inside,
the walls are hung with paintings, many of them by Alice
herself, including a series called Crusader Follies, which
she has described as “an extended allegory in paint, a twist
on the link between our oil-driven culture and the horse-
based Crusades.”
Alice's paintings can be seen at 
www.sculptureranch.org,
and her short films, produced under the label Ink Well
Productions, can be viewed on YouTube. 
Kirt Kempter
We caught Kirt Kempter
just in time. He was
preparing to leave for a
23-day trip around the
Pacific Ocean on a private
plane as a speaker on an
educational tour hosted
by National Geographic.
The group’s destinations?
Costa Rica, Iguazu Falls
(Brazil), Patagonia,
Easter Island, New
Zealand, China and Japan. 
Kirt is no stranger to global
travel. As a geologist, teacher and photographer living 
in Santa Fe, he has spent decades working as a field
geologist with projects near home and in Mexico and
Costa Rica. He leads 7 to 8 tours a year for National
Geographic, the Smithsonian Institution, and local
organizations including Southwest Seminars. 
Kirt always brings a camera along. His large format 
photos capture the beauty and scope of Western land-
scape. Kirt sometimes donates photocanvases to the 
Law Center for auction, and has been a member since
2005 when he first heard Doug Meiklejohn speak. 
“I was very impressed,” he recalls. “I knew it was an
organization I wanted to support. Even though I’m a
geologist and have lots of colleagues who went into oil
and gas, economic geology has never been of interest to
me. When I study geology and the story of life on the
earth, it makes me feel more strongly the need to protect
the environment. We’re one of over 8 million species on
the planet and we have to share it. We need to keep it a
good home for everybody.”
Kirt’s photography is available at the Abiquiu Inn and
The Pantry in Santa Fe. And though he hasn’t updated
his website in a couple of years because of his busy
schedule, you can see examples of his work at
www.geomosaics.com.
