FALL 2014
T wenty-Seven Y ears of Environmental and Community Victories1
This was supposed to be a story about an appeal in a case 
that’s been underway since 2008. But this summer, Augustin
Plains Ranch, LLC and the State Engineer tried to make the case 
evaporate. You’re making sure we can challenge them.
On September 22, 2014, Law Center Staff Attorney Bruce Frederick asked
the state Supreme Court to order the State Engineer to deny a second
water grab application filed by Augustin Plains Ranch, LLC. (His petition
for a writ of mandamus can be found at nmelc.org.)
Background: In August, the Ranch and the State Engineer backed out 
of the court appeal over the biggest private water grab attempt in New
Mexico history. The Ranch seeks to acquire 54,000 acre-feet of water per
year (afy)–enough water for Albuquerque for six months–to sell to some
unknown entity sometime in the future.
Under normal circumstances, this would be good news for our clients
and for New Mexico’s water. But the machinations underway suggest
that this is a tactic to ditch a legal process that likely would end the
Ranch’s bid and affirm our state’s laws against water speculation.

“Our clients and New Mexico taxpayers 
are being penalized by having to start the process 
over again just because the Ranch put a different 
shade of lipstick on this pig. ”– Bruce Frederick, staff attorney

The drive from Anthony, NM to Santa Fe is about four
and a half hours. Imagine driving there and back just
so you could talk to the people who will decide what
happens in your backyard. That's what Maria Elena
Bejarano and Betty Gonzalez did just to be a part of
the public process and to have their voice heard. They
wanted to tell those people what it's like to live near a
mega-dairy with hundreds of cows just across the road.
“Most meetings take place in Albuquerque or Santa
Fe,” says Betty, “and we are at the southern end of the
state. Trying to get people to go up there...it's hard. 
We don't have the resources. When we go, we make
the trip all in one day. We take our own car, we pay
for our own gas, you know? But we feel that it's...”
“...important enough,” says Maria Elena.
They were the only community members available to
go to the public hearing back in the Spring, but the
dairies, “they're well represented at these meetings,”
says Betty. 
Other community members, Maria Elena explains, “are
concerned, but they feel they can't do anything. That's
one of the basic things that I hear from them: ‘What can
we do? They got more than what we can fight them with.’”
These women, both proud grandmothers, have been
living in this community for over thirty years each.
They moved here to Anthony to be close to their families,
to raise their children in a rural environment and have
them close to their generational roots. Their neighbor-
hood wasn't always such a hard place to live.“When 
I moved here in 1978, I didn't even know there was a
dairy,” says Maria Elena. “It didn't smell. Then they
Big Dairy wants to pollute more of
our water. Here’s how you can help:
The dairy industry is trying to gut our state’s “Dairy
Rule,” which protects water from dairy pollution. A
hearing on the dairy industry’s petition is tentatively
scheduled for December. 
You can be an important part of the process, because
decision-makers and the public need to hear from
residents concerned about protecting water supplies
and public health.

started increasing
the number of  
cows and that's 
what caused it  
to get bad.”
“I will be here,” 
pointing to her 
kitchen sink, "peeling chiles, 
washing dishes, all that good stuff and there it is,” 
the overwhelming stench of manure. Maria Elena goes
on to explain how the flies got so bad last year. “One
time my cousin came over and out of three doors she
didn't know where to come in. It was just packed with
flies. They were on everything.”
“That's the thing,”adds Betty. “We can't enjoy anything
outside.”
The Del Oro Dairy is about 600 feet from Maria Elena's
home and stretches about a half mile long. It is one of
several mega-dairies in the area and is one of the small-
er operations. A short drive down Interstate 10 past
Las Cruces shows why the area is called “Dairy Row”.
Law Center Attorney Jon Block represents Rio Valle
Concerned Citizens in its efforts to get existing ground-
water contamination along Dairy Row cleaned up. Rio
Valle Concerned Citizens is also working with the Law
Center and other communities around New Mexico that
are impacted by dairies to protect the existing “Dairy
Rule.” The Rule, which was adopted in 2010, has 
proactive pollution control and monitoring provisions
to keep dairy waste out of water. The Dairy Industry has
tried to overturn it since 2011, and has now petitioned
in the Water Quality Control Commission to gut it.
(Please see “Here’s How You Can Help” next to this profile).
“The NMED can only control what happens with 
the groundwater,” says Maria Elena. “We thought we
could do something about the flies and different things
but it was only about groundwater and we didn't
know. We were very naive.”
But they've learned that the dairies threaten their
groundwater as well. “We want to know that our well
water is going to be protected,” says Betty. “Everything
depends on water, so we've GOT to do something.”
“We're trying,” says Maria Elena.
“I try to pep her up and she tries to pep me up...” says
Betty and they laugh. “It just feels like we all have our
hands tied and so what do you do? What do you do?
But at the same time you can't just let it continue to
happen! And I think that's why we just feel like we
can't let it continue.”
While the industry and the State continue to 
haggle, Betty and Maria Elena, along with their 
neighbors, live their day to day lives.
When thinking back on the time spent living with 
swarms of flies and the smell, Maria Elena reflects, 
“To me, we let it go on far enough, because of our
ignorance, because we did not know what we could
and could not do. We need to make [the dairies]
accountable for what they are doing and not doing.
They need to be good neighbors. Water is precious
here in this state and it seems like it's being abused.”
“[Dairies] need to

As a Law Center member, you’ve been supporting our
work to bring international attention to environmental
injustice in New Mexico for years. This summer, you
helped us appear before the United Nations’ Committee
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).
As chair of the Environmental Justice Working Group of
the U.S. Human Rights Network, Eric was one of three
New Mexicans who traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, to
present on environmental injustice to the CERD during
its quadrennial review of the United States’ progress
towards racial equality . Here are a few of his Facebook posts:
August 11“Great day at the U.N.! I was able to talk to 
several committee members and they were VERY sympa-
thetic to both the uranium mining and Albuquerque air pollution
issues. T omorrow is the big day – our formal presentation to the 
full Committee. We have a very good presentation and I think we
can go a long way to making the world aware of what's going on 
in New Mexico.”

statement to the CERD committee about the U.S.'s human rights
violations as they relate to environmental rights...The Committee

it's time for the real work to begin! ...Whatever happens, we 
must now use this information to continue to fight for New Mexico

Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment (uranium
mining) and the SouthWest Organizing Project(air quality
in Bernalillo Co.) at nmelc.org. See Eric’s posts at
facebook.com/NMELC .
1)Meaningful recommendations from the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination to the United States. For instance, the Commission recom-
mended that the U.S. “undertake an independent and effective investigation into 
all cases of environmentally polluting activities and their impact on the rights of 
affected communities, bring those responsible to account, and ensure 
that victims have access to appropriate remedies.”
2) NMELC’s subsequent filing of a human rights report on behalf of the Multicultural 
Alliance for a Safe Environment to the U.N. Human Rights Council for its quadrennial 
Universal Periodic Review of the United States.
3) A federal civil rights complaint filed by the Law Center on behalf of the SouthWest Organizing Project. The
complaint calls on the Environmental Protection Agency to take to task the City of Albuquerque and Bernalillo
County for discriminating against communities of color and low-income communities when making decisions
about where to site air-polluting facilities.
Y our support has made it possible to take on
several new cases this summer.
SANTOLINA DEVELOPMENT Albuquerque
We represent the SouthWest Organizing Project (SWOP)
as it challenges the 40,000 Santolina development
proposed for the Westside of Albuquerque. One of
our client’s fears is that the 100,000+ person 
subdivision will suck water out of communities 
and acequias in the South Valley.
HONSTEIN BULK FUEL DEPOT Albuquerque
We also represent SWOP to prevent the issuance of
an air quality permit to the Honstein Oil Co. for a
bulk fuel storage facility located in the San Jose
neighborhood of the South Valley.

“They say that water flows uphill to money,” says
Bruce Frederick, the Law Center Staff Attorney who
has represented more than eighty individuals and 
families in this case since 2008. “This case challenged
that idea. Law Center members made it possible for us
to demonstrate that the application was illegally 
speculative under the New Mexico Constitution
because it said nothing about how, when or by whom
the water would be used. Based on that argument, the
State Engineer denied the Ranch’s application in 2012.
Six months later, a state District Court Judge upheld
the State Engineer’s decision.”
But in July, less than a month before the state Court of
Appeals was scheduled to hear arguments in the case,
the Ranch submitted a second application to the Office
of the State Engineer. Just as before, the Ranch lists no
specific end use or buyer for the 54,000 afy of water it
seeks. The second application is essentially the same
application as before,
and therefore just 
as illegal as the first 
application.
Still, seemingly con-
fident that its second
application will be 
accepted, the Ranch 
withdrew its first 
application and 
dropped its appeal 
two days before its 
court date.
“The Ranch has 
obviously spent a lot of money and time weaving a
colorful story about what it might do with this water,”
says Frederick. “But no matter how elaborate its story,
the Ranch has not satisfied the first requirement for
appropriating water: showing that it has any actual
purpose or place of beneficial use for the water. 
Our clients and New Mexico’s taxpayers are being 
penalized by having to start the process over again 
just because the Ranch put a different shade of lipstick
on this pig.” 
We’ll keep you apprised of the next steps that the Law
Center and its clients take to prevent this water grab.

Art detective, veteran appraiser, expert 
witness for the FBI, world traveler, 
lecturer, blogger, TV host, professor, 
passionate conservationist, and long-
time Law Center supporter, Bernard         
Ewell is an interesting character indeed. 
Now he can add 
“published author” to 
his long list of accom-
plishments with the
recent publication of his nonfiction book entitled 
Artful Dodgers:
Fraud and Foolishness in the Art Market.
Bernard tells all in this tale of the international art market,
highlighting “the crooks and their victims” in what he calls “the
most unregulated market on earth”. Having spent more than
four decades in the business as an expert on Salvador Dalí, this
book is an exposé from the agile mind of an insider. 
From his home bases in Santa Fe and San Miguel de Allende,
Mexico, Bernard travels the globe as the authority on Dalí’s work.
Having traveled since the age of 7, he’s now set foot in 49 countries
(and counting) on five continents via 1,135 airplanes. He hitch-hiked
back and forth across W est Africa while doing some of his doctoral
studies at the University of London and the University of Ghana.
He’s been a guest lecturer at the National Museum in Beijing, and
frequently travels to Europe on Salvador Dalí assignments. 
Bernard makes his annual contribution to the Law Center a 
priority because, in his words, “they are the gold standard when 
it comes to professionalism and significant results, and their 
priorities are always right.”
Artful Dodgers: Fraud and Foolishness in the Art Marketis

Bernard’s website at www .bernardewell.com.

The Law Center was saddened to learn of the
passing of another friend and loyal supporter,
Andrew Nowak. Andy was a member of the Law
Center for many years, and was also a friend to many
other environmental, community and social service
organizations in New Mexico and nationally .
He served as an expert advisor for the Law Center on air 
quality issues and also offered a series of lectures on the topic to
Law Center staff. Though Andy had worked closely with us, we
were surprised – and humbly gratified – to learn that he had made
provisions for the New Mexico Environmental Law Center in his
will. W e will put his gift to good use fighting for cleaner air 
(as well as water and land), for all New Mexicans.

FALL 2014
T wenty-Seven Y ears of Environmental and Community Victories1
This was supposed to be a story about an appeal in a case 
that’s been underway since 2008. But this summer, Augustin
Plains Ranch, LLC and the State Engineer tried to make the case 
evaporate. You’re making sure we can challenge them.
On September 22, 2014, Law Center Staff Attorney Bruce Frederick asked
the state Supreme Court to order the State Engineer to deny a second
water grab application filed by Augustin Plains Ranch, LLC. (His petition
for a writ of mandamus can be found at nmelc.org.)
Background: In August, the Ranch and the State Engineer backed out 
of the court appeal over the biggest private water grab attempt in New
Mexico history. The Ranch seeks to acquire 54,000 acre-feet of water per
year (afy)–enough water for Albuquerque for six months–to sell to some
unknown entity sometime in the future.
Under normal circumstances, this would be good news for our clients
and for New Mexico’s water. But the machinations underway suggest
that this is a tactic to ditch a legal process that likely would end the
Ranch’s bid and affirm our state’s laws against water speculation.

“Our clients and New Mexico taxpayers 
are being penalized by having to start the process 
over again just because the Ranch put a different 
shade of lipstick on this pig. ”– Bruce Frederick, staff attorney
