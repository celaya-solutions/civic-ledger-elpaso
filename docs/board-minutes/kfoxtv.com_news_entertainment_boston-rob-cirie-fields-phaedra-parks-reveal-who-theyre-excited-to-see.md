'Boston Rob,' Cirie Fields & Phaedra Parks reveal who they're excited to see on 'Traitors'
Everyone is counting down the minutes until ‘The Traitors’ season 4 premieres, and past contestants and winners reveal what the castle has in store!
While at the first-ever Televerse event in Los Angeles back in August, we caught up with “Boston Rob” Mariano (“The Traitors” season 3), Cirie Fields (Winner, “The Traitors” season 1), Bob the Drag Queen (“The Traitors” season 3), and Phaedra Parks (Winner, “The Traitors” season 3) who dished about what to expect this upcoming season.
“Boston Rob” points out the differences between “The Traitors” and “Survivor,” where he reached legend status, saying, “Traitors’ is harder strategically, don’t get it twisted. ‘Survivor’ physically is way harder.”
He continues, “You’re out there not eating and not eating for a month and a half, you know, but like, from a meta point of view, it's still a game where you have to manage risk and reward and your target. It's different now, because I played ‘Traitors’ at a point in my quote, unquote, career where I'm a known person, and so you have to manage and deal with that as well. I think those are the biggest differences.”
“Boston Rob” ended up being eliminated as a traitor in his season, but when asked if he would go back and do anything different, he says you have to “play the hand you’re dealt.”
“I don’t know if I would do anything different. It's like you have to play the hand you're dealt, and that's the biggest thing on both the shows. Like, you adapt to different situations, and just know that sometimes you'll be able to do something about it, and other times you can't.”
He continued, “Like, to me, in the moment with Bob the Drag Queen, I felt like in that moment, I had to go get him. In hindsight, looking back, maybe I could have waited, but like, why take that chance? That's the way I play. I play an aggressive style, and when it works, it works, and when it doesn't, it doesn't. But I sleep well at night after.”
But if he had the chance to go back would he want to be a traitor again? “I don’t know. It’d be kind of nice to see what it’s like on the other side.”
“The Traitors” season 1 winner Cirie Fields has some wise words for the season 4 cast: “Less is more. You don’t have to be the chief. Be an Indian. The Indians go way farther in the game of ‘Traitors.’” She continues, “You want to be invisible. Those who are seen get banished.”
When it comes to whose game she’s most excited to see play out, she said, “I think Natalie Anderson. She won ‘Survivor,’ but she’s kind of like a low-key type. She’s the perfect person to be a traitor.”
Cirie continues, “She [Natalie] gives off those trustworthy vibes. She doesn't have to be in the forefront. She's a great competitor. I think she has a great strategic mind. I could be predicting the next ‘Traitors’ winner, because there hasn't been one since myself.”
So what does it take to win “The Traitors” as a traitor? “’The Traitors’ is balance. Knowing when to talk, when not to talk, knowing when to shine and when not to shine, and being authentic especially in a game like ‘Traitors,’ where the paranoia is high and people are trying to sniff out fakeness.”
Now, if “RuPaul’s Drag Race” winner, Bob the Drag Queen, were to return to the castle, he said, “I would go back on the show and honestly, I would do what I did. I had a lot of fun on the show.”
He continued, “Could I go in there and be quiet? Yeah, but I wouldn't be having fun.”
Bob’s “Sibling Rivalry” podcast host, and also a former “Drag Race” winner, Monét X Change, is set for season four, and when asked if he gave his BFF any advice, he quickly replied, “No.” Then added, “I didn’t do that well so would you ask me for advice?”
Honestly, that’s a fair point, Bob!
“Real Housewives of Atlanta” alum Phaedra Parks, would return to the show “in a New York minute.” Adding, “I love ‘The Traitors’ it was my most favorite television job I’ve ever had.”
When it comes to who she’s most excited to watch in the upcoming season, “Skater guy. [Johnny] Weir. I think he’s gonna be hilarious.”
She continues, “Of course, I want to see my girl Dorinda [Medley] come back. Of course, ‘frick and frack,’ Porsha [Williams] is on there. You know, all of the housewives will definitely bring the fashion.”
She concludes, saying, “Kelce’s, his mom Like, what is that about?”
This refers to the season four casting of Travis and Jason Kelce’s mother, Donna Kelce.
It’s sure to be a wild and turbulent season, and we can’t wait for it!“The Traitors” premieres Thursday, Jan. 8, on Peacock.
