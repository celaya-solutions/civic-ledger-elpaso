The six best New Year’s episodes of TV to ring in 2026!
“Stranger Things” may be dropping its finale tonight, but if you’re in a more festive mood, we’ve got six TV recommendations to ring in 2026.
Friends “The One with All the Resolutions”
We’ve never really wanted these characters to change, but they did their best in this season five episode full of New Year’s resolutions: Monica wanted to take more pictures, Chandler said he’d stop making fun of his pals, Rachel swore to stop gossiping, and Ross decided to try something new every day, which famously resulted in a leather pants emergency.
How I Met Your Mother “The Limo”
Many 20-somethings have dreamed of cruising through the city in a limo to ring in the new year at a glamorous party. Leave it to Ted and his friends on “How I Met Your Mother” to overcomplicate that idea and wind up stuck in the titular vehicle to celebrate the changing of the calendar.
That ‘70s Show “That ‘70s Finale”
The long-running sitcom set its series finale at the decade’s end, reuniting most of the gang, including Topher Grace, Laura Prepon, and Ashton Kutcher, at the Forman house for one last hang.
Seinfeld “The Millennium”
The actual millennium was still three years away when this episode aired in 1997, but Kramer and Newman are already looking ahead, starting off as co-planners before deciding to host dueling celebrations. Also, keep an eye out for a pre-“Gilmore Girls” Lauren Graham as Jerry’s latest girlfriend.
The Office “Ultimatum”
The gang at Dunder Mifflin is ready to revamp themselves for the new year in this season 7 episode. It features the staff's New Year’s resolutions posted on a board, sparking awkward drama and hilarity before the ball drops.
Modern Family “New Year’s Eve”
Shenanigans ensue in Palm Springs as Claire and Phil, and Cam and Mitchell, try to recapture their youth and romance, while Jay ends up in a poker game with Billy Dee Williams, playing himself. Meanwhile, Haley and Alex try to manage the other kids back home, but none of them are prepared for what Luke and Manny have planned.
