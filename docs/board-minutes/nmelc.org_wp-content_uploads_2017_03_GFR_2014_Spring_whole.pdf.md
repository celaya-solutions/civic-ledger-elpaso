Twenty-Six Years of Environmental and Community Victories    1
In September 2013, the New Mexico
Water Quality Control Commission
(WQCC) adopted the egregious Copper
Rule. For the first time ever, the State
is permitting an entire industry to 
pollute New Mexico’s water resources.
As a Law Center member, you made
it possible for the Law Center to
build a damning record against the
regulations during the rulemaking.
Now you’re making it possible for us
to challenge the Rule in the second
highest court in New Mexico. Staff
Attorney Bruce Frederick is lead
counsel on the case, and filed the
appeal in November.
Y our support built the record on which
that appeal is based. It shows:
• State collusion with Freeport 
McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly
traded copper mining company.
• A shoddy defense of the Rule by the
New Mexico Environment Department
(NMED). The agency did not present
even one qualified technical staffer 
in support of the Rule.
• Willful violation of the state’s Water 
Quality Act, which requires that 
groundwater be protected from 
pollution. For the first time ever, the
State is permitting an entire industry
to pollute New Mexico’s water resources.
The Copper Rule exempts water
beneath and around copper mines
from water quality standards. It allows
mining companies to forego pollution
prevention measures and monitoring
within these exempt areas. All mining
companies have to do? Promise to
contain contaminated water. Forever. 
“For more than twenty years, New
Mexico has reaped the rewards of its
Mining Act, including cleaner water
and meaningful mine reclamation,”
says Brian Shields, Executive Director
of Amigos Bravos, a watershed pro-
tection organization. “In one fell swoop,
the Copper Rule will reverse existing
protections for the water we drink
and play in. And it opens the door 
for other industries, like the dairy 
industry, to seek similar permission
to dump in our state's aquifers.”
“Every New Mexican who cares about
water should thank a Law Center
member,” says Allyson Siwik, Executive
Director of the Gila Resources Information
Project
(GRIP), which is represented by
the Law Center. “You have made it
possible for GRIP – and the public
interest – to have robust legal repre-
sentation in one of the most critical
legal fights over water protection in
New Mexico’s history. Thank you.”

Law Center fights on behalf of

Flynn Fact Check
didn’t back down, NMED attorneys filed a motion intended
to discredit Olson. The Hearing Officer not only denied the
motion, but struck it from the record.
3. When 
asked if he is proud of the Copper Rule, Flynn responded,
“Absolutely . I believe this Rule is the most protective rule for  
copper mining in the country . And we’ve compared this Rule    
against all the other jurisdictions where copper mining occurs.”
Fact Check: Despite Secretary Flynn’s assertions that it is 
protective of groundwater, the Copper Rule does not provide
the protection that was assured under the regulations it replaced.
In many instances, regulations in Arizona and Nevada are
more protective of groundwater than the Copper Rule as well.
This page is from the draft Statement of Reasons for
the Copper Rule, obtained by the Law Center from NMED through
a public records request. While we expected the agency to work with
Freeport McMoRan to draft the document, the agency did not
originally disclose that Gallagher and Kennedy, P .A. (which
represents Freeport) wrote substantially all of the 214 page order
that NMED proposed as its own, and that the
Water Quality Control Commission adopted verbatim.
Circled in red is the Gallagher and
Kennedy reference number.
During the fall session of the Navajo T ribal
Council, there was an unsuccessful effort
to insert a pro-uranium amendment into
the Navajo Nation Energy Bill. It would
have allowed Uranium Resources, Inc.
(URI) to conduct an in situleach uranium
mining “demonstration project” in
Churchrock. Due to efforts by members of
the Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium
Mining (ENDAUM) and several allies, the
amendment failed by a vote of 2-11. 
Undaunted,Tribal Councilman Leonard
Tsosie and URI circumvented the Tribal
Council. Along with Katherine Benally ,
chair of the Navajo Resources Development
Committee, Tsosie pushed the same 
language through his Committee on a vote
of 3-0. The committee hearing was held
two days before Christmas in an Arizona
town 150 miles away from Churchrock. 
“Especially after its defeat in October, 
URI knows that it can’t get the Navajo
ban on uranium mining overturned by
the T ribal Council. But given the company’s
financial straits, it was not surprising that
it would work with a few Tribal Council
members to perform an illegal end run
like this,” says Eric Jantz, lead NMELC
attorney on the case. 
"Fortunately , we have many members
who support ENDAUM and its mission
to keep new uranium mining out of
Navajo communities. 
If the Navajo Nation 
doesn’t overturn 
the legislation, 
we’ll be there 
to challenge 
the efforts of 
the Committee

New Mexico Environment Department
(NMED) in February , 2014.
Ryan Flynn was confirmed by the New Mexico Senate as
Secretary of the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED)
in February 2014. Prior to his appointment Mr. Flynn served 
as the lead attorney at the agency . He came to NMED from the
Modrall Sperling law firm, which represents several of 
New Mexico’s largest polluting corporations.
Law Center Executive Director Douglas Meiklejohn joined other
conservation groups in publicly opposing the confirmation in a
hearing before the Senate Rules Committee. 
Several of Mr. Flynn’s statements at the hearing gave us pause.
For instance: 
1. In response to the allegation that Flynn “basically let copper 
companies rewrite the [Copper Rule] regulations,” Flynn 
responded “I disagree with that suggestion.”
Fact Check:  Documents show that the attorneys who 
represent Freeport McMoRan wrote the bulk of the“Statement
of Reasons”adopted by the Water Quality Control Commission;
the Commission relied upon this Statement when it adopted
the Copper Rule. NMED submitted the Statement as its own,
until the Law Center provided the proof of collusion.
2. In response to allegations that Mr. Flynn sought to intimidate 
NMED contractor William Olson in order to keep him from 
testifying against the Copper Rule at the public hearing, 
“No threats were made. No intimidation occurred… [T]he 
Environment Department did not seek to strike Mr. Olson’s 
testimony or in any way prevent him from participating in 
the proceeding.”
Fact Check: William Olson was head of NMED’s Groundwater
Bureau from 2004-2010. After he retired, he was tapped by
the agency to lead the Copper Rule development process.
He ended his contract after NMED’s upper management
added Freeport McMoRan’s pollution clauses to the draft
Rule; he then announced that he would oppose the adoption
of the Rule. Olson sent a letter to NMED Secretary David
Martin asserting that Flynn 
threatened him with legal 
action to keep him from
testifying. When Olson
Humate Mine Victories
How you helped stymie a company that tried to 
game the system
If you’re a mining company in violation for exceeding your permit size, you could
pay your fine and fix the problem. Or, if you’re Mineras Vitae LLC, you:
1) Hire a high powered legal/lobbying firm.
2) Ask the State to change mining regulations to better accommodate your needs.
3) Work to pass legislation that would change the Mining Act to accommodate 
your company .
Fortunately for New Mexico’s environment, our members made sure that the
Law Center was on the case. 
Humate is decomposed organic matter that is used as a soil amendment. Mineras
Vitae strip mines the material in McKinley County .  Representing Amigos Bravos,
we persuaded the New Mexico Mining Commission that it should not give the
company everything it wanted – primarily an expansion of the definition of 
“minimal impact mine” from 10 acres to 60 acres. Rather, the Commission rewrote
the regulations to allow humate producers to operate “minimal impact” mines 
of up to 20 acres.
Like the Copper Rule, this is a story of a company trying to rewrite the rules for
its own gain, albeit on a smaller scale. Without Law Center members standing in
its way , Mineras Vitae may very well have succeeded.

Case Updates
Law Center client Maria Elena Bejaranolives in
Anthony , NM. Her home is in the midst of “Dairy Row,”
where more than a dozen industrial-scale dairies have
spread through Dona Ana County to the Texas border.
She and her neighbors, along with a coalition of public-
interest groups and concerned citizens affected by
dairies, are working to keep dairy pollution out of New
Mexico’s communities and drinking water supplies.
This is an excerpt from an email she sent during the 
2014 legislative session. She wrote to oppose House 
Bill 51, which weakened language under which 
residents can file nuisance lawsuits against dairies.
Representatives of the House Judiciary Committee:
I live less than 500 feet from a dairy , since 1978.  My house has
been here since the early 1900s and occupied continuously
since it was built.  When I moved here, the dairy was small
and not an issue.  Now it has grown to over 3,000 cows, in
about the same amount of space and most definitely a big issue.
Here I am at 6:21 a.m. today , everything closed and a faint
stench is slowly coming in.  I opened my door and sure enough,
it stinks outside from the dairy .  This is one of the real issues
affecting community residents!  
The pollution/contamination does not stop at the dairies’
fences. It goes far beyond their fences and it goes into my
home affecting me with all the flies, stink, stench, and dust
that engulfs my home and the community! How can a quality
of life be had with all this happening daily and a number of
times a day? And this is JUST what is seen!
There is the unseen:  ground water/pollution that not even
the NM Environment Department seems to be able to stop.
This ground water pollution does NOT stop at these dairies’
fences either. This pollution plume travels wherever the ground
water travels, and into communities’ water systems contami-
nating our groundwater as identified by a NM Environment
Department Stage 2 Abatement letter sent to me in December
2013...And this has been going on for years with no end in sight.
Let’s talk about what we are breathing: manure dust. It  
most assuredly has germs and bacteria; particulates that are
so minute they go in through your nose and your skin pores.
How healthy can this be I ask you? Ammonia, methane gas,
hydrogen sulfide and the list goes on. How healthy can THIS
be I ask you?
In recent decades, economic pressures have left many U.S.
dairy farmers with a choice: expand or go out of business.
As a result, New Mexico now has the largest herds in the
country, averaging 2,088 cows per dairy.  Each of those cows
produces around 120 gallons of wet manure every day.
That means at each of these “megadairies”, New Mexico
dairy farmers have to deal with more than 250,000 gallons of
waste every day. 
It is no surprise, then, that groundwater beneath 57% of
New Mexico’s dairies was already polluted in 2010 when the
State adopted groundwater regulations specifically targeted
at protecting groundwater from dairy waste.
Now, the dairy industry wants to overturn those protections.
As a Law Center member, you make it possible for us to
mount a strong defense of the existing Dairy Rule. In this
case, we represent Maria Elena, the Sierra Club Rio Grande
Chapter, Amigos Bravos and others. But the outcome will
affect thousands who use water in our parched dairy regions.
The dairy industry is following in the footsteps of the copper
mining industry in asking for regulations that allow 
groundwater pollution. The hearing on the dairy industry’s
petition has been postponed until the week 
after the November election. The Law 
Center will work throughout the year 
to defend our state’s protections
from this attack.

What environmental issues are the most important to
you? Top 3:
1) Water quantity/quality 
2) Climate Change 
3) Oil and gas drilling/fracking 
“Water is the most critical resource in New Mexico. 
The lack of competence in the state’s regulatory agencies
is appalling and the influence and power of the State has
created a crisis for the environment.”
How well do you think environmental regulations 
protect your community’s health?
“In this state it’s all about how regulations impact 
economics – not about anyone’s health.”
In the next 5 years, what is your hope regarding 
environmental issues facing New Mexico? Top 3:
1) The development of a plan for dealing with the growing 
water shortage
2) To see concrete moves to address the coming effects of 
climate change
3) To see a commitment from decision-makers to protection   
future drinking water sources from pollution
Why do you give to local New Mexico non-profits? Top 3:
1) I believe supporting local non-profits positively affects my 
life and my loved ones. (57.3%)
2) I believe that local grassroots organizations are more 
effective than national organizations. (44.2%)
3) I volunteer and I give to the nonprofits for which I

Twenty-Six Years of Environmental and Community Victories 5
Case Updates
A Faint Stench is Slowly Coming in...
Hundred of flies are around just about all year.  Relief from flies
may be about two months, may be.  These flies also do not stop
at the dairies’ fences either.  They like doors that if you open
them, they zoom right in no matter how fast you open and close
the door.  My granddaughter and I have to run inside, or run 
outside, in tandem, trying to close the door as fast as possible so
the least possible amounts of flies enter my house!  Again I ask
you: how healthy can THIS be?
Last March (2013), my granddaughter, a 3rd grader, was told
about a meteor that she could view around 6:00 p.m.  The stink/
acrid stench coming from the dairy was so bad she and I could
not stand to be out there even for a minute!  We actually ran back
into the house because the stench was burning my nose.  
Needless to say , the stink came into the house since we opened
and closed the door and the stink was so strong. And this is 
typical of our lack of quality of life because of the dairy .  So 
needless to say , we did not look for the meteor.  Again, I ask you:
how healthy can THIS be and in how many ways?
I have not tried to sell my house, but I’m sure I would have a
heck of time trying to sell it; especially when the wind blows
across from the dairy side and over to my property and the flies
are at their best and most!
Where a number of these contamination, polluting and 
irresponsible operations, as is, are in poor communities where 
citizens do not have the resources to defend their rights.
Bottom line on this legislation is the denial of citizens’ and 
communities’ rights to protection from these contamination, 
polluting, and irresponsible operations!  It’s about NUISANCES;
if dairies were more responsible, maybe this conversation would
not even be happening....  
Thank you,
Maria Elena Bejarano

Case Updates
A Faint Stench is Slowly Coming in...
Hundred of flies are around just about all year.  Relief from flies
may be about two months, may be.  These flies also do not stop
at the dairies’ fences either.  They like doors that if you open
them, they zoom right in no matter how fast you open and close
the door.  My granddaughter and I have to run inside, or run 
outside, in tandem, trying to close the door as fast as possible so
the least possible amounts of flies enter my house!  Again I ask
you: how healthy can THIS be?
Last March (2013), my granddaughter, a 3rd grader, was told
about a meteor that she could view around 6:00 p.m.  The stink/
acrid stench coming from the dairy was so bad she and I could
not stand to be out there even for a minute!  We actually ran back
into the house because the stench was burning my nose.  
Needless to say , the stink came into the house since we opened
and closed the door and the stink was so strong. And this is 
typical of our lack of quality of life because of the dairy .  So 
needless to say , we did not look for the meteor.  Again, I ask you:
how healthy can THIS be and in how many ways?
I have not tried to sell my house, but I’m sure I would have a
heck of time trying to sell it; especially when the wind blows
across from the dairy side and over to my property and the flies
are at their best and most!
Where a number of these contamination, polluting and 
irresponsible operations, as is, are in poor communities where 
citizens do not have the resources to defend their rights.
Bottom line on this legislation is the denial of citizens’ and 
communities’ rights to protection from these contamination, 
polluting, and irresponsible operations!  It’s about NUISANCES;
if dairies were more responsible, maybe this conversation would
not even be happening....  
Thank you,
Maria Elena Bejarano

The Mad P otter Plays Many Roles
Jamie Douglass loves to get her hands dirty . Usually it’s the result of potting unique combinations
of flowers and plant materials – and the occasional unexpected statuary – as owner of Mad Potter
Container Gardens. But it also happens when she shows up to volunteer once a week at the Law
Center, where she takes on any task in front of her.
Jamie’s love of horticulture led her to leave a 15-year career in investment banking back in
Chicago. She took a degree in Horticulture/ Landscape design, then went to work for the
Chicago Botanic Garden. She managed 45 inner city gardens in an outreach program serving
impoverished neighborhoods in the inner city , working with horticulture therapy sensory gardens,
school gardens, and senior centers. “In my investment career I worked with Chicago's wealthiest
citizens but I felt the inner city gardeners were the richest,” she recalls of those years.
Ready for another change, Jamie moved to Denver, where she worked for several non-profit
organizations including a micro economic project with homeless and those living on the margins
of society , and Grounds for Learning, a school garden program utilizing school grounds as an
outdoor classroom.
Super Members
A wonderful benefit of working at the
Law Center is meeting amazing members
who want to help us succeed! When we
got a call from long-time member Julia
T akahashi in October asking if we’d like
help getting our first “crowdfunding”
campaign off the ground, we couldn’t 
say yes fast enough. W orking on a class 
project, she and her classmate Victoria
Erhart helped us create a video about 
the Copper Rule, launch it online and
exceed our goal in no time! 
W e started 
with a $3,500 goal and raised $5,275.
That success also earned us an additional $3,000 challenge grant
from a board member! Thank you Julia, Vicki and everyone who
made this campaign a success! See the video atcrowdrise.com/nmelc.
Congratulations to Eleanor Wootten, 
winner of the first David Henderson
Award for Conservation

Mexico. In honor of his work to
protect our state’s environment, 
the Law Center instituted the 
David Henderson Award for
Conservation.

was Eleanor Wootten, an activist and philanthropist who has 
generously supported conservation efforts across New Mexico

Long-time Member 
Leaves Bequest
The Law Center staff were saddened 
to learn of the passing of long-time 
member and supporter Elaine Anne 
Hounsell last September, at the age of 72.
Elaine had a long career with the National Park Service, working
as a seasonal or permanent employee in 14 parks, including the
Everglades, North Cascades, and Bandelier. Initially she worked 
as a field interpreter, later moving into management positions. In
the National Park Service’s Employees and Alumni Association
newsletter “Arrowhead”, the notice of her passing says she was
“always known as one for breaking barriers”. It remembers her as
an avid hiker who “loved birds, the pet cats she had over the years
and all aspects of nature, and was a member and supporter of
many conservation and environmental groups.” Thank you Elaine.
If you would like to name the Law Center in your estate plans, we
fervently hope you’ll let us know . W e’d like to know your story ,
honor the intentions of your gift and thank you directly . 
(Y ou have
the option to remain anonymous, or to be publicly acknowledged for
your support.)
Please contact Elizabeth Lee at (505) 989-9022.
Jamie says she was drawn to the Law
Center because she “wanted to learn
more about the environment in New
Mexico and how the law can be part
of protecting our natural resources. 
I wanted to know what’s going on
with issues like the dairy industry,
water, mining, and other issues.”

Congratulations to William Olson, 
winner of the 2013 Karl Souder Water
Protection Award
William (Bill) Olson was

groundwater quality when
he worked in state govern-
ment, including seven years
as Ground Water Quality
Bureau Chief. Fortunately
for New Mexicans, he

for groundwater protection 
in his retirement. For his
important work as a regulator and his courageous challenge of the
Copper Rule, we were pleased to present Bill with the Karl Souder
W ater Protection Award in 2013.
Thank you, K yla!

Twenty-Six Years of Environmental and Community Victories    1
In September 2013, the New Mexico
Water Quality Control Commission
(WQCC) adopted the egregious Copper
Rule. For the first time ever, the State
is permitting an entire industry to 
pollute New Mexico’s water resources.
As a Law Center member, you made
it possible for the Law Center to
build a damning record against the
regulations during the rulemaking.
Now you’re making it possible for us
to challenge the Rule in the second
highest court in New Mexico. Staff
Attorney Bruce Frederick is lead
counsel on the case, and filed the
appeal in November.
Y our support built the record on which
that appeal is based. It shows:
• State collusion with Freeport 
McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly
traded copper mining company.
• A shoddy defense of the Rule by the
New Mexico Environment Department
(NMED). The agency did not present
even one qualified technical staffer 
in support of the Rule.
• Willful violation of the state’s Water 
Quality Act, which requires that 
groundwater be protected from 
pollution. For the first time ever, the
State is permitting an entire industry
to pollute New Mexico’s water resources.
The Copper Rule exempts water
beneath and around copper mines
from water quality standards. It allows
mining companies to forego pollution
prevention measures and monitoring
within these exempt areas. All mining
companies have to do? Promise to
contain contaminated water. Forever. 
“For more than twenty years, New
Mexico has reaped the rewards of its
Mining Act, including cleaner water
and meaningful mine reclamation,”
says Brian Shields, Executive Director
of Amigos Bravos, a watershed pro-
tection organization. “In one fell swoop,
the Copper Rule will reverse existing
protections for the water we drink
and play in. And it opens the door 
for other industries, like the dairy 
industry, to seek similar permission
to dump in our state's aquifers.”
“Every New Mexican who cares about
water should thank a Law Center
member,” says Allyson Siwik, Executive
Director of the Gila Resources Information
Project
(GRIP), which is represented by
the Law Center. “You have made it
possible for GRIP – and the public
interest – to have robust legal repre-
sentation in one of the most critical
legal fights over water protection in
New Mexico’s history. Thank you.”
