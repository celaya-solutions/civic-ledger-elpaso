SUMMARY:
The effort to re-open Copper Flat Mine involves two separate but related issues: 1) a water rights case [which has its own case page] that will determine the mine operator’s access to water and 2) several issues related to the mine’s operating permit. On the mining side, the Bureau of Land Management has to complete an environmental impact statement (EIS) because part of the proposed mine site is on federal land. New Mexico Copper Corporation submitted a mine operating permit application to the Mining and Minerals Division and a groundwater discharge permit application to the NM Environment Department. Those applications had hearings in September and October 2018. The main issue with this proposed mine is its potential impact to ground and surface water quality and quantity in Sierra County.
