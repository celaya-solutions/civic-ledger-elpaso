Dear Friends, 
With the year 2017, the Law Center reached 
an important milestone – our 30th anni -
versary. With support from many gener -
ous people – who have given early and 
often of their time, expertise, and financial 
resources – the Law Center has grown to 
a thriving orgnization with a full-time staff 
of nine and a docket over the years of just 
shy of 300 cases.
I wish I could say at this point that we had 
put ourselves out of business, but that is 
clearly not the case (no pun intended). 
Unfortunately, with our current state and 
federal administrations hacking away at 
environmental regulations, and low-in -
come communities and communities of 
color still bearing the brunt of environ -
mental pollution and degradation, the 
work of the Law Center is in high demand.
At the close of 2017, with support from individuals and foundations across the state, we 
gathered enough funds to hire an additional full-time staff attorney. The new hire, who 
we will bring on board in 2018, will navigate the complex world of water protection in 
New Mexico. With roughly 80% of our case work involving issues of water quality and 
water quantity, and 9 out of 10 New Mexicans relying on groundwater for their drink -
ing water, the need for this position is obvious.
If you have been a supporter of the Law Center for many years, you know that our 
cases do not resolve quickly. Some of our cases, particularly those involving uranium 
mining, date back 20 years. In 2017, as you will see in the Top 10 case highlights, we 
were victorious in some important cases while in others we are still deep in the trenches  
– and will be for years to come, such as with the Santolina mega-development battle. 
Thanks to your support, we are able to fight on to protect New Mexico’s air, land, water 
and communities.

NMED petitioned the WQCC seeking fundamental changes 
to ground and surface water quality regulations. Before the 
hearing on the petition, we and our clients came to an agree -
ment with NMED on changes to the definition of a “toxic 
pollutant” and human health standards for groundwater. 
NMED agreed to convene a working group on the matter and 
bring recommendations to the WQCC by December 2019. 
NMED also withdrew a contentious proposal  for “discharge 
permit amendments” that would have allowed so-called 
“minor” changes to groundwater discharge permits with-
out prior public notice or hearing. An important proposal  
brought to the WQCC would allow variances “for the life 
of the facility”, which is illegal under the NM Water Quality Act and gives industry no incen -
tive to prevent pollution of groundwater discharge or to abate groundwater pollution. We also  
challenged some proposed changes to rules for abatement plans to remediate polluted water. The 
outcome of this case will affect groundwater discharge permit cases for years to come. (Clients: 
Amigos Bravos, Gila Resources Information Project; Attorney: Jaimie Park)
After years of delays and ineffective action by the US Air Force to clean up the jet fuel plume  
threatening Albuquerque’s largest drinking water well field, we submitted a draft Consent Decree 
to the Air Force outlining a cleanup process for the contamination from the bulk fuels facility 
at Kirtland Air Force Base. The Air Force invited us into confidential settlement negotiations, 
but these stalled under the new federal administration. Both the NMED and the Albuquerque 
Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority have notified the Air Force of serious deficiencies in its 
required Facilities Investigation Report. We and our clients are evaluating whether to file suit in 
Federal District Court to force the Air Force to adopt enforceable milestones and deadlines, and to 
work more closely with affected neighborhoods. (Client: SouthWest Organizing Project; Attorneys: 
Douglas Meiklejohn, Jaimie Park, Jon Block)
For years, the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Air Quality Board has issued air pollution permits as 
if each polluting facility existed in isolation and has refused repeated efforts by the impacted com -
munities in Albuquerque’s South Valley to have the Board consider cumulative impacts. As a result, 
we filed a civil rights complaint with the Environmental Protection Agency and are waiting for its 
determination. In the interim, we and our clients filed a notice of appeal in the State Court of Appeals 
challenging the Court’s upholding issuance of a permit for the Honstein bulk fuel depot in the San 
Jose neighborhood. [In early January 2018, we learned that NMED asked to intervene on the side of the 
City.] (Client: SWOP; Attorneys: Eric Jantz, Jon Block)
With help from the Law Center, community members have a chance to push for a meaningful  
moratorium on uranium mining in McKinley County. We threatened to sue the McKinley County 
Commission for violating the state’s Open 
Meetings Act after the Commission put the 
moratorium on the agenda of a poorly publi -
cized meeting instead of the regularly sched-
uled meeting. The Commission re-passed the 
same toothless resolution, but promised to 
work with community members on a stronge 
ordinance. (Client: Multicultural Alliance for 
a Safe Environment; Attorney: Eric Jantz)

Thanks to great collaboration between executive director Douglas Meiklejohn and our allies in the 
environmental community and the Legislature, we prevented all the bad bills we targeted from 
passing out of the Roundhouse.
The Court of Appeals sharply rebuked the Water Quality Control Commission (WQCC) and 
then-Secretary of the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), Ryan Flynn (2-time winner 
of our annual Toxic Turkey award) for refusing to allow a public hearing on a discharge permit 
for Los Alamos National Laboratory’s chromium plume monitoring program. The Court stressed 
that the intent of the Water Quality Act is to 
provide maximum public participation, and 
the decision is an important affirmation of 
the public’s role in NMED permits. (Client: 
Communities for Clean Water; Attorney: 
Jaimie Park)
During a packed hearing at the Catron County 
courthouse, the Water Rights Division of the 
State Engineer’s Office (OSE) said an applica-
tion by Augustin Plains Ranch (APR) to with-
draw over 16 billion gallons annually was 
speculative and should be denied. The OSE’s 
final determination will come in 2018. Despite 
several attempts at an application, APR has not identified a buyer, a place of use, a beneficial use, or 
an end user. (Clients: 80 individuals and organizations; Attorneys: Douglas Meiklejohn, Jaimie Park)
In a victory for community residents, the Third Judicial District Court dismissed most of the water 
rights claimed by the New Mexico Copper Corporation and two water rights sellers. The case is 
tied to the proposed re-opening of the Copper Flat mine, near 
Hillsboro, NM. The Court found support for just over 900 acre 
feet of the 7,500 acre feet claimed, which is not sufficient for min-
ing operations. (Clients: 14 individuals and the Hillsboro Mutual 
Domestic Water Consumers Association; Attorney: Jon Block)
In the Copper Flat water rights case (above), the Court found a 
long history of failed and half-hearted attempts by a changing 
set of companies to start copper production at the Copper Flat 
Mine. Despite this, the federal Environmental Impact Statement 
and state permit processes are moving ahead. Copper Flat would 
be the first mine granted a permit under the new “Copper Rule”, 
written by industry and passed in 2014. (Client: Turner Ranch 
Properties; Attorney: Jaimie Park)
A State District Court Judge reversed the Bernalillo County Commission’s ruling granting Western 
Albuquerque Land Holdings and Consensus Planning the zoning change they need for their pro -
posed 13,000-acre Santolina development on Albuquerque’s West Mesa. Many of the rules for how 
large-scale master plans are approved have not been followed, including for the Level A and Level 
B Master plans and the required development agreement on water. (Clients: 6 organizations and 7 
individuals; Attorneys: Douglas Meiklejohn, Jaimie Park)
