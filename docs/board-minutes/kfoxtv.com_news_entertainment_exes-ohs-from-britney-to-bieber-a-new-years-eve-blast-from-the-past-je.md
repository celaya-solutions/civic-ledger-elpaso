Exes & Ohs: From Britney to Bieber, a New Year’s Eve blast from the past
Hope you’re thirsty, because we’re pouring a tall glass of New Year’s Eve nostalgia.
It was a simpler time, when Jessica Simpson thought "Chicken of the Sea" was ocean-dwelling poultry and Justin Bieber’s iconic bangs roamed free across his forehead.
So, let’s fire up the Wayback Machine and revisit our favorite exes, icons, and socialites from New Year’s Eves past.
GWEN STEFANI AND GAVIN ROSSDALE
Back in 1999, the "No Doubt" singer and the "Bush" frontman rang in New Year’s Eve with MTV in Times Square. Gwen and Gavin tied the knot in 2002, but after three children and nearly 13 years of marriage, they divorced. The split came amid rumors the “Machinehead” rocker cheated with their nanny. Stefani later married her “The Voice” castmate, country star Blake Shelton, in 2021.
CHRISTINA AGUILERA
The “Dirrty” diva appeared to arrive solo to a New Year’s Eve dinner at Donatella Versace’s home in 2002, the same year she began dating music executive Jordan Bratman. The two tied the knot in 2005 but officially ended their marriage in 2011. The Grammy winner has been engaged to her former production assistant, Matthew Rutler, since 2014.
BRITNEY SPEARS AND NATALIE PORTMAN
The “Black Swan” actress and the “Baby One More Time” singer co-hosted a New Year’s Eve bash in New York City in 2002. While the pairing may seem unlikely, the two share an interesting connection: as kids, they were understudies for the same role in an off-Broadway musical. 2002 also marked the end of Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake’s three-year relationship.
JESSICA SIMPSON AND NICK LACHEY
In 2004, the “Newlyweds” stars shared a sweet on-air kiss during “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve.” Less than a year later, the “I Wanna Love You Forever” singer and the "98 Degrees" member filed for divorce. Simpson went on to marry former NFL tight end Eric Johnson in 2014, though the couple separated in January 2025. Lachey, meanwhile, married Vanessa Minnillo in 2011, and the two are still going strong.
LINDSAY LOHAN
Fresh off the success of “Mean Girls,” the starlet was spotted flashing a peace sign while party-hopping in Miami on Dec. 31, 2005. At the time, Lohan was between a 2004 breakup with “That ’70s Show” star Wilmer Valderrama and a short-lived romance with restaurateur Harry Morton in 2006. She later married financier Bader Shammas in 2022, and the couple share a son, Luai.
PARIS AND NICKY HILTON
The socialite sisters popped bottles of champagne in Las Vegas as they rang in 2007. Paris briefly dated “Desperate Housewives” star Josh Henderson that year before moving on to “Good Charlotte” rocker Benji Madden in 2008. Fast forward to 2021, Paris and entrepreneur Carter Reum tied the knot at a star-studded Bel Air wedding. They have two children together.
JOSH DUHAMEL AND FERGIE
The “Transformers” actor and the “My Humps” singer rang in the final hours of 2008 at The Venetian in Las Vegas. Less than two weeks later, they tied the knot in Malibu, California. After ten years of marriage and a son named Axl, Fergie filed for divorce. Josh has since married former beauty pageant contestant Audra Mari, while Fergie has kept her love life largely private.
KIM, KOURTNEY, AND KHLOÉ KARDASHIAN
The famous sisters rang in 2009 together at LAX nightclub. That year, Kim had an on-again, off-again romance with former NFL star Reggie Bush. 2009 was also the year Khloé married ex-NBA player Lamar Odom just 30 days after meeting him. Meanwhile, Kourtney announced in 2009 that she was expecting her first child with Scott Disick.
MARIAH CAREY AND NICK CANNON
To usher in 2010, the "Always Be My Baby" hitmaker and the "Wild 'n Out" star watched the ball drop in the Big Apple. The new year brought big announcements for the couple, including renewing their wedding vows and revealing they were expecting twins. Four years later they split up, but officially divorced in 2016. Since then, Nick has fathered a double-digit number of kids.
SELENA GOMEZ AND JUSTIN BIEBER
At the end of 2009, the Biebs serenaded Selena Gomez with his hit “One Less Lonely Girl” during “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve.” They kept fans guessing about their relationship until nearly a year later, when they were spotted arm-in-arm outside an IHOP. Gomez denied the rumors at the time, saying, “It was pancakes!,” but it marked the beginning of the “Jelena” era.
JENNIFER LOPEZ AND MARC ANTHONY
After performing a medley of hits in Times Square, the “Let’s Get Loud” singer and then-husband Marc Anthony shared a sweet embrace to kick off 2010. They married in 2004, went on tour together, co-starred in the movie "El Cantante," and welcomed twins. By 2007, they had officially split, though their divorce wasn’t finalized until 2014. The exes have remained close friends since.
JAY-Z AND BEYONCÉ
A decade after meeting and two years into their marriage, Jay-Z and Beyoncé rang in New Year’s Eve at the Marquee nightclub in Las Vegas. As 2010 came to a close, the “Crazy in Love” couple embarked on a new chapter filled with chart-topping hits, starting a family, an infamous elevator fight, and Jay-Z admitting to infidelity. Yet, through it all, their love has endured.
We hope you enjoyed our blast from New Year's Eve past. Here's to 2026!
