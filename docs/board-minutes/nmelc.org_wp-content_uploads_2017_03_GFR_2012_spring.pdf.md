Billions of gallons of Water at stake
NM Officials Consider Request for Water Appropriation 
Judge says State Commission 
can’t reconsider Pit Rule...yet
W e sat in benches that looked remarkably like pews.  There were about 100 of us in the
Socorro County courthouse on February 7 – a smattering of reporters and me sprinkled in
a crowd that mostly hailed from Catron County , where an Italian billionaire seeks to claim
more than 17 billion gallons of water annually .  In what seemed like an oddly short hearing
– just over an hour– the
dozen or so attorneysin
the room argued the
points of law in one of
the most important
water battles in recent
memory .
“In essence, Augustin
Plains Ranch simply
wrote a very large
number [of acre-feet] on 
a piece of paper and
listed every potential need
for water that might arise sometime in the future within a vast area of the state, ”explained
Law Center attorney Bruce Frederick, who represents most of the people in the gallery .
Shortly before her election, Susana Martinez promised that “As governor, I would absolutely
remove the Pit Rule as a regulation.” Her promise took a stumble in February , after District
Court Judge Raymond Ortiz granted us a rare “writ of prohibition” in the case.
Industry appealed the Pit Rule in state District Court in July 2008; that case is ongoing.
Leery of an uncertain outcome, the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association (NMOGA) took a
new tack late last year in its efforts to sink the Rule. Put this case on hold, its attorneys asked
District Court Judge Barbara Vigil, and the Oil Conservation Commission will adopt our
new proposed Pit Rule. Then the Court won’t have to worry about this case anymore.  
Judge Vigil ordered a stay of the appeal in January 2012.   
On the same day as Judge Vigil handed down her decision, NMELC attorney 
Eric Jantz filed a petition for the writ. “One of the basic tenets of our 
democratic system is the separation of powers,” explains Eric.“Once a 
regulation has been appealed, the executive branch is done making decisions 
in the case. At that point, it’s up to the courts to decide what happens.” 
A month later, Judge Ortiz issued the writ of prohibition.

“It took me more than two hours to drive
down from Santa Fe, and I never left the
area of use proposed by the Ranch.”
The hearing centered on Motions to 
Dismiss the Ranch’s water rights 
application. We, along with the Middle
Rio Grande Conservancy District, filed
those motions in February 2011. The
Cliff’s Notes version of our motion:

“I’m super glad we have a resource
like the Law Center,” Fiebelkorn said.
“I’ve been doing this work for more than
twenty years, and I never thought that
in the 21st century, so much of my time
would be spent on legal maneuvering.”  
Douglas Meiklejohn, the Law Center’s
Executive Director said the CIC clearly
violated laws, including the open 
meetings law. “A commissioner stated
that the CIC had discussed the issues
before its public meeting, which is
against the law,” he explained.
“Another problem is that the CIC
should explain its actions. It is common
for an agency to say, ‘this is what we
looked at, and this is how we came to a
decision.’” 
A True Collaborative Process
Contrast the actions of the CIC 
under the Martinez Administration to
the painstaking work done by the Code
Change Committee in 2009 and 2010. 
“I was the only energy advocate on the
committee,” Fiebelkorn recalled. “The
other members were builders, people
who would enforce the codes locally,
Construction Industries Division staff
members, state engineering and minerals
staff members, architects and builders.
We met weekly for 14 months, and we
had to come to consensus on every part
of that code.” The Code Change
Committee also met with representa-
tives of cities, counties, building-supply
companies, national builders, utilities
and environmental groups.  
In 2010 the CIC unanimously
accepted the energy conservation codes,
which mandated that energy usage
would be 20 percent more efficient. 
Energy Efficiency that Makes Sense
for New Mexico
“We didn’t pull estimates out of the
air,” Fiebelkorn continued. “We worked

Con artists rely on speed. They pressure,
create confusion. They don’t allow their
victims time to weigh alternatives or
ask questions.  
It’s no wonder New Mexico’s envi-
ronmental community feels conned by
the way the Construction Industries
Commission [CIC] rolled back the state’s
energy conservation codes on June 10,
2011. It took a mere four minutes for 
the CIC to vote to repeal the state’s
electrical, energy conservation and
mechanical codes and replace them 
with codes that just barely meet federal 
standards. During that same four 
minutes, the CIC also voted to amend
the state’s plumbing codes.
The Wrong W ay to Repeal a Regulation
Every aspect of the Martinez
Administration’s building codes repeal
and replacement was rushed. “What
they held were not public hearings,”
said Tammy Fiebelkorn, a member of
the Code Change Committee that 
drafted the energy conservation codes.
“At a real public hearing witnesses can
ask questions, they can cross examine
other witnesses.  Instead, under the
Martinez Administration, witnesses
were given two minutes, then they were
cut off.  The meetings in Albuquerque,
Farmington, Las Cruces and Roswell
were all held on the same night. There
were no commissioners at any of those
meetings.” 
The CIC repealed and amended the
codes a week after those four statewide
meetings. “There was no discussion, no
pros and cons–just a vote,” Fiebelkorn
added. “There was supposed to be
analysis, expert witnesses.” The com-
mission was so blatant in its contempt
for the law, it issued a press release
announcing its decisions before the
meeting was over, even though the votes
to amend the codes took place at the
end of the meeting.  
with the builders, and they provided
the cost of those measures. We made
sure our code would save people more
than it cost. We really thought through
the issues faced by low-income home
buyers and renters. Most low-income
people rent, and landlords have no
incentive to make apartment buildings
more efficient.”
Compared to the energy saved, the
added building costs under the 
efficiency codes were small. Fiebelkorn
estimates an increase of $750 on an
average home and perhaps $2,000 for 
a very large house. For commercial
buildings the added expense was
approximately one half of one percent.
“We have to change our mindset
because the cost of energy is going to
increase over time,” said client Faren
Dancer, a Santa Fe green builder and
host of Green Talk Radio. “Why create
more buildings that are going to be 
too expensive to maintain, more 
buildings that will need to be 
retrofitted in a few years?”
Santa Fe’s building codes prove
Dancer’s point. They mandate a 30 
percent increase in energy efficiency.
Since the recession began, production
builders have constructed the majority
of new homes in Santa Fe. “They’re
building affordable housing,” Dancer
said. “Large national companies like
Centex are building in Santa Fe and
they are meeting the code.”

CLIMATE CHANGE 
Simply put, it’s complicated
In a nutshell, since 2010 there have been 
• two rulemakings to adopt two major 
climate change rules (we petitioned for 
Rule 100 on behalf of New Energy 
Economy and New Mexico Environment
Department petitioned for Rule 350); 
• two rulemakings to repeal those rules; 
• three state Supreme Court victories in 
our favor; and
• seven appeals by industry .
The Environmental Improvement Board
just repealed the regulations, although
there was no substantive new evidence
offered at the rulemaking hearings this fall.
W e’ll keep you apprised of what happens
in these cases this year.
OIL & GAS DRILLING
We don’t need no ‘fracking’  
regulations
In December 2011, the Oil Conservation
Commission adopted industry-sponsored
regulations governing disclosure of fluids
used for hydrofracturing (“fracking”).  
The new regulations require drilling 
companies to disclose some of the fluids
they inject into the ground–and to disclose
no less than 45 days after they frack. 
It’s no surprise that these rules are worse
than those in Wyoming and T exas.  
For more on oil and gas, see page 1.

In 2011, Governor Susana Martinez and her Administration tackled many
of New Mexico’s most progressive environmental protections. W orking
hand-in-hand with industry (Small Business-Friendly T ask Force, anyone?),
her staffers worked to repeal regulations, help corporations step over 
community concerns, and hamper regulatory oversight.  
Our members didn’t stand by and idly watch. Y our support went above
and beyond in 2011, making it possible for us to challenge nearly every
attempt by her Administration to weaken regulations that protect air, 
water, land and people.  Sometimes the best defense is a strong offense…
sometimes it’s a tough attorney .

INDUSTRIAL DAIRIES 
We’re going to milk this victory 
for a long time
Governor Martinez’s first executive order,
signed within minutes of being sworn in,
stopped the publication of new regulations
like the dairy groundwater standards.  
A victory in 2011 before the state Supreme
Court mandated that the rules be printed.
Shortly thereafter, we entered into 
negotiations with the New Mexico
Environment Department (NMED) and
the dairy industry – and safeguarded the
substantive environmental provisions in
the dairy regs. The final regulations were
adopted in December 2011.
URANIUM MINING 
What happens when your permit
application is old enough to drive?
In 2011, the State became a major player
once again in our uranium casework.  
In Church Rock, NMED asserts that it can
renew Hydro Resources’ groundwater 
discharge permit–a permit that expired in
1996 (by the way , people who were born
in 1996 are now eligible to drive...)
We filed a lawsuit in July 2011 to stop 
the renewal process, and to prevent the
company from mining unless a valid 
permit is issued; we anticipate a 
decision this Spring.
The State just awarded the shuttered
Mount T aylor mine its 4th“standby”
mining permit since 1998, despite the fact
that the mine is leaking a radioactive
plume into groundwater. W e are appealing
the permit to the state Mining Commission.

In 2011, Governor Susana Martinez and her Administration tackled many
of New Mexico’s most progressive environmental protections. W orking
hand-in-hand with industry (Small Business-Friendly T ask Force, anyone?),
her staffers worked to repeal regulations, help corporations step over 
community concerns, and hamper regulatory oversight.  
Our members didn’t stand by and idly watch. Y our support went above
and beyond in 2011, making it possible for us to challenge nearly every
attempt by her Administration to weaken regulations that protect air, 
water, land and people.  Sometimes the best defense is a strong offense…
sometimes it’s a tough attorney .

INDUSTRIAL DAIRIES 
We’re going to milk this victory 
for a long time
Governor Martinez’s first executive order,
signed within minutes of being sworn in,
stopped the publication of new regulations
like the dairy groundwater standards.  
A victory in 2011 before the state Supreme
Court mandated that the rules be printed.
Shortly thereafter, we entered into 
negotiations with the New Mexico
Environment Department (NMED) and
the dairy industry – and safeguarded the
substantive environmental provisions in
the dairy regs. The final regulations were
adopted in December 2011.
URANIUM MINING 
What happens when your permit
application is old enough to drive?
In 2011, the State became a major player
once again in our uranium casework.  
In Church Rock, NMED asserts that it can
renew Hydro Resources’ groundwater 
discharge permit–a permit that expired in
1996 (by the way , people who were born
in 1996 are now eligible to drive...)
We filed a lawsuit in July 2011 to stop 
the renewal process, and to prevent the
company from mining unless a valid 
permit is issued; we anticipate a 
decision this Spring.
The State just awarded the shuttered
Mount T aylor mine its 4th“standby”
mining permit since 1998, despite the fact
that the mine is leaking a radioactive
plume into groundwater. W e are appealing
the permit to the state Mining Commission.

Billions of gallons of Water at stake
NM Officials Consider Request for Water Appropriation 
Judge says State Commission 
can’t reconsider Pit Rule...yet
W e sat in benches that looked remarkably like pews.  There were about 100 of us in the
Socorro County courthouse on February 7 – a smattering of reporters and me sprinkled in
a crowd that mostly hailed from Catron County , where an Italian billionaire seeks to claim
more than 17 billion gallons of water annually .  In what seemed like an oddly short hearing
– just over an hour– the
dozen or so attorneysin
the room argued the
points of law in one of
the most important
water battles in recent
memory .
“In essence, Augustin
Plains Ranch simply
wrote a very large
number [of acre-feet] on 
a piece of paper and
listed every potential need
for water that might arise sometime in the future within a vast area of the state, ”explained
Law Center attorney Bruce Frederick, who represents most of the people in the gallery .
Shortly before her election, Susana Martinez promised that “As governor, I would absolutely
remove the Pit Rule as a regulation.” Her promise took a stumble in February , after District
Court Judge Raymond Ortiz granted us a rare “writ of prohibition” in the case.
Industry appealed the Pit Rule in state District Court in July 2008; that case is ongoing.
Leery of an uncertain outcome, the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association (NMOGA) took a
new tack late last year in its efforts to sink the Rule. Put this case on hold, its attorneys asked
District Court Judge Barbara Vigil, and the Oil Conservation Commission will adopt our
new proposed Pit Rule. Then the Court won’t have to worry about this case anymore.  
Judge Vigil ordered a stay of the appeal in January 2012.   
On the same day as Judge Vigil handed down her decision, NMELC attorney 
Eric Jantz filed a petition for the writ. “One of the basic tenets of our 
democratic system is the separation of powers,” explains Eric.“Once a 
regulation has been appealed, the executive branch is done making decisions 
in the case. At that point, it’s up to the courts to decide what happens.” 
A month later, Judge Ortiz issued the writ of prohibition.
