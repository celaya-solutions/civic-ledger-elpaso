Another Supreme Court win for
the environmentSetting precedent that
will protect New Mexicans for generations to come
double edged sword for community groups.
Our client, the Mesquite Community
Action Committee, commented last year in
an administrative proceeding about the
negative impacts that the Helena Chemical
Company has on their
neighborhoods. Earlier
this year, Helena
appealed its air quality
permit to appellate
court; we attempted 
to intervene, but were
denied. Because the
group was not an 
official party to the 
proceeding, the
Supreme Court did 
not require the 
appellate court to
grant us party status.
“This could be a 
difficult ruling for
communities,” says 
Law Center attorney
Jon Block. “Concerned 
residents will have to
get involved in an official capacity at the
beginning of a proceeding,or they may
lose their rights to participate later. It’s 
a tough thing to ask of New Mexicans who
don’thave expertise in how the system
works and lack the funds for the lawyers
and experts needed to challenge 
agency permitting decisions.” 
For more information on our 
greenhouse gas case, see page 2.
Also see nmelc.org for updates 
and background information.
In July, the Law Center and its members
scored their third victory of the year at the
state Supreme Court. In a unanimous 
decision, the justices ruled that parties which
participate in rulemakings can, by right, 
participate in appeals.
The case sprang
from an appeal filed
by PNM and our
state’s other major 
carbon polluters to
get “Rule 100” over-
turned. Rule 100 is
the carbon cap that
we and our client,
New Energy Economy,
won in 2010, after 
two years of work. 
The Supreme
Court’sdecision over-
turned a May ruling
by the Court of
Appeals to keep New
Energy Economy and
several other public
interest groups out of 
PNM’s appeal. We are now parties in that case.
“This is an important victory,” said attorney
Bruce Frederick. “If the Court of Appeals’s
opinion were allowed to stand, public-interest
groups would be barred from defending on
appeal the same regulations that they drafted
and persuaded an agency to adopt. Then
there would be little point in advocating for
good regulations in the first place.”
Ruling A Double-Edged Sword
While the ruling is a victory for New
Energy Economy and others, it also can be a

Law Center asks judge to stop illegal tactics by State 
Surrendered documents show NMED manager catered to mining company
A new lawsuit aims to stop the New Mexico 
Environment Department (NMED) and Hydro 
Resources, Inc. from illegally expediting 
uranium mining in the Navajo community 
of Church Rock.
The lawsuit asks a District Court judge to 
determine that the agency has no authority to 
consider the company’s groundwater discharge 
permit as valid. The permit, which was issued 
in 1996, expired in 2003; we  assert the company 
needs to undertake a new permitting process.
The suit also asks the judge to rule that 
NMED cannot allow Hydro Resources to
discharge into ground-water unless the agency
issues a new, valid permit. Disturbing aspects 
of this case became apparent this spring, after
lead counsel Eric Jantz filed an Inspection of 
Public Records Act request.  
The Smoking Emails, From the Top
• Email from Hydro Resources’ lobbyist 
complaining about a letter sent March 23 
by Groundwater Chief Bill Olsen to Hydro 
Resources. The letter mandated that,
“Hydro Resources must receive a [ renewal 
of its discharge permit] before mining 
can commence.”
• An email from NMED regulator George 
Schuman documenting that,“Deputy
Secretary [Solomon] indicated that the sentence 
pertaining to the need to obtain a renewal 
permit prior to commencement of mining was 
hindering Hydro Resource's ability to obtain 
financing for their mine development project 
and directed me to reissue the March 23 letter 
absent the problematic sentence…”
• The revised letter, issued without the 
“problematic sentence.”
• Memo from Chief Olsen stating, “While I was on 
vacation, a revised and reissued letter was sent to 
Hydro Resources under my signature and signed 
on my behalf without my knowledge, review or 
approval.”
[Ed. Note:  Deputy Secretary Raj Solomon was fired from
NMED in July for undisclosed reasons.)
In June, the New Mexico Construction
Industries Commission ignored required
rulemaking procedures, and summarily
repealed three building codes and amended
another. The codes that were repealed and
amended, which included the Energy
Conservation Code adopted in 2010, would
have required new construction to be 20%
more energy efficient than wasrequired
previously. Those codes were developed
through a collaborative process that included
the construction industry, public-interest
groups, and regulators. In terms of conserving
energy, these four codes were the best
standards of their kind in the United States.
The Law Center jumped into the fray
soon after the repeal. “It is not clear
whether the Commissioners who voted
for the changes (one Commissioner voted
against the changes) and the Construction
Industries Division (which proposed the
changes) were not aware of the procedural
requirements or simply chose to disregard
them,” says Douglas Meiklejohn, lead
attorney on the case. He explains that the
Commission did not explain its decision for
the repeal; did not base its decision on
technical testimony showing why the Code
should be repealed; and did not offer
adequate opportunities for public comment
and cross-examination. The Commission
also refused initially to submit to the
Court as part of the record the draft min-
utes of the meeting at which it r epealed
the Code, but the Court granted our motion
that the draft minutes should be included.
The Law Center filed an appeal in the
State Court of Appeals on July 11, and is
awaiting word how the Court will han-
dle the case. Our clients in the case
include
the Southwest Energy Efficiency
Project, Sundancer Creations Custom
Builders, Environment New Mexico, the
Sierra Club, e-Solved, Inc., and several
individuals, including Sundancer owner
Faren Dancer.
Tackling the Martinez Administration…again
In late 2010, the Environmental Improvement Board (EIB) adopted regulations 
limiting carbon emissions by our state’s largest greenhouse gas polluters. After
Governor Susana Martinez came to office, she dismissed the 2010 EIB members, 
and installed seven new members.  
This summer, PNM and other groups petitioned the new EIB to repeal the 
regulations. On October 2, as a result of a motion made by the Law Center, EIB
members James Casciano and Gr egory Fulfer r ecused themselves from the pro-
ceedings to consider repeal. Both men testified against the proposed regulations in 2010.
(They remain on the EIB.)
Who Recused…and Who Didn’t
Chairwoman Deborah Peacock –patent attorney & former mining engineer – negotiated in
private with PNM and other opponents of the carbon regulations to temporarily shut down
their court appeal of the regulations. The EIB and our opponents entered into a settlement 
that led directly to the industry groups petitioning the EIB to repeal the carbon regulations.
Member Jeffrey Bryce – mechanical engineer with 10 years of experience in the oil & gas 
industry– listed as his personal reference the attorney for the Independent Petroleum
Association of New Mexico; that attorney is representing the Association in the hearings
to repeal the carbon regulations.
Member John Volkerding – General Manager for a company that disposes of oil and gas
drilling wastes.
Member James Casciano –manager of Intel’s Environmental Health and Safety program–
testified against the carbon reduction regulations in 2010. RECUSED

Digital Journey Brings Impacts into Focus
Film to feature impacts that Law Center and its supporters have had across state
In late July, Sebia Hawkins (Law Center
Development Director) and I traveled with
Emmy-winning filmmakers Debra Anderson
(Split Estate)and Doug Crawford. For six
days, we visited clients, asking them to 
talk about their experiences with the 
New Mexico Environmental Law Center.
This film will share their stories, and share
the impact that the Law Center and its
members have had on communities
throughout the state.
First Stop, Church Rock
In Church Rock, we met with Larry 
J. King. He lives on his family's ranch, 
surrounded by red rock cliffs and rolling
grass hills. A former uranium miner, he is
now on the board of Eastern Navajo Diné
Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM),
working to prevent new uranium mining
in his community.
As Debra filmed him, he pointed to one
proposed minesite, a stone’s throw from
his front door.
I asked Larry to tell us how the Law
Center has helped their 17-year long fight.
He said that if it wasn't for the Law Center,
he was sure there would have been 
uranium mining happening across the
road from his home years ago.
Next Stop, Crownpoint
We met with Christine Smith, who is
also a member of ENDAUM and lives in
Crownpoint. There, she raised her family;
sings in her church next door and can look
out the back window of her home to see a
proposed uranium mill site. 
She talked about learning the risks of
uranium mining and gaining confidence so
that she could educate her community. And
she said without the help of the Law Center,
she has no doubt the uranium would’ve
been in her backyard a long time ago.
Onward to Pie T own
We left Navajo Country and drove south
on N.M. 602 through lush green valleys
towards Pie Town, where we met clients
who are challenging a 17 billion gallon-
per-year water grab (with a quick break 
for pie, of course!)   
Our clients, mostly ranchers and farmers,
expressed their gratitude at having a
lawyer to confer with. San Augustin
Coalition Treasurer Eileen Dodds said the
Law Center’s assistance was essential in
helping the community join together in
unified opposition to an attempt by an
Italian billionaire to take the region’s water.
Reflections at Home
What struck me during these interviews
was how the Law Center amplified the
strength of our clients. They spoke of the
fear, anger and frustration that occurred
when they first heard of the threat coming
to their home.  Then they spoke of how the
Law Center provided them with tools to
face the threat – when no one else would.

desecration of the sacred mountain and
to establish a process that will protect
the environment and the health of
future generations. The Coalition
brings together citizens of Acoma
Pueblo, Laguna Pueblos and the Navajo
Nation, as well as Anglo groups of former
uranium miners and local residents who
have been impacted by Cold War-era
uranium contamination.  
MASE and the Law Center are currently
awaiting the issuance of a Draft Environ-
mental Impact Statement by the U.S.
Forest Service, which manages a portion
of land where the mine is proposed.The
next step will entail proceedings for
state-level permits. Because this is the
first mining permit application for 
uranium since the passage of the New
Mexico Mining Act in 1993, it will set
the standards for all future conventional
uranium mining permits.  
“For whatever reason, the mining
company and the regulators are going
through the process too quickly,” said
Nadine Padilla, MASE’s Coordinator.
“It’s not a well defined process. They’re
just making it up as they go. I think it
needs to be slowed down so the public
is offered more opportunities to be heard.”
Mount Taylor: sacred mountain under siege 
Uranium companies versus native peoples in fight for holy place
On published atlases of New Mexico,
the stratovolcano that forms the highest
peak of the San Mateo range is called
Mt. Taylor. But, the mountain has other,
more ancient names. The people of Acoma
and some members of the Laguna
Pueblo call it Kaweshtima. Other Laguna
people call it Tsibina. In the Zuni Pueblo
it is Dewankwin Kyaba:chu Yalanne.
The Navajo know it as Tsoodzíl. Among
the Hopi, it is Tsiipiya.
Each of these tribes has a unique 
creation narratives, and Mt. Taylor 
figures prominently in all. For the region’s
tribes, the mountain is a breathing 
entity, embodying a spiritual essence.
It is home to immortal beings and a
place of pilgrimage and prayer. Its
springs and seeps are sacred.
The Players
In October of 2009, Roca Honda
Resources, LLC applied for a permit to
open a uranium mine on the Mt. Taylor
District of the Cibola National Forest.
Roca Honda is owned by Strathmore
Minerals of Canada, and Sumitomo
Corporation of Japan.  
The Multicultural Alliance for a Safe
Environment [MASE], represented by
the Law Center, is fighting to stop 
Throwing Away Water
The mining permit, if approved,
would allow the company to remove 
up to 11.5 million gallons of water a day
from the mountain’s aquifer. “Dewatering”
would continue for 16 years, or longer,
and could discharge more than 60 billion
gallons of water into San Mateo Creek.  
Even if the mine treats the water to a
high standard through decades of 
dewatering, radioactive and non-
radioactive pollutants left in the creek
by previous uranium mines will likely
become waterborne. The effluent could
also impact the Homestake Tailings
Superfund site, just 12 miles down-
stream, and already a major source of
water contamination in the region.
According to Eric Jantz, lead counsel
on this case, the mine application fails 
to analyze how the removal of billion
gallons of water from the aquifer will
affect sacred springs and seeps. It
ignores the cumulative effects of 60 years
of uranium mining in the region.  
It doesn’t consider how moving billions 
of gallons of water through a polluted
landscape will affect residents of the
Grants Mineral Belt or future generations
of Native Americans who will depend
on local ground water.
“I think it’s time we start looking at
other forms of economic development
in the Grants Mineral Belt,” Padilla said.
“What we’ll gain from this mine doesn’t
outweigh the cultural loss to our people.”

of Mount T aylor’s Traditional Cultural
Properties designation under Governor
Richardson – and the revocation of that 
designation by a Lea County judge during

We were thrilled to be named the winner of the first Quiet Inspiration Award.
The Award, presented by the Santa Fe Community Foundation on October 4, is
given to an “Un-sung Hero” organization whose hallmark is to work quietly and
respectfully among a wide range of people in the community.  
“The Center’s nomination struck the Awards Committee as the epitome of
behind-the-scenes dedication,” says Brian Byrnes, the Foundation’s President and
CEO. Coincidentally, twenty-one years ago, the Law Center was the r ecipient of
the Foundation’s first Jack Kenney Award for Outstanding Community Service 
in the Environment.  
Our hearty thanks to the Foundation, to our member–volunteer Joan West for
nominating the Law Center, and to all of our members who make our work possible!

Another Supreme Court win for
the environmentSetting precedent that
will protect New Mexicans for generations to come
double edged sword for community groups.
Our client, the Mesquite Community
Action Committee, commented last year in
an administrative proceeding about the
negative impacts that the Helena Chemical
Company has on their
neighborhoods. Earlier
this year, Helena
appealed its air quality
permit to appellate
court; we attempted 
to intervene, but were
denied. Because the
group was not an 
official party to the 
proceeding, the
Supreme Court did 
not require the 
appellate court to
grant us party status.
“This could be a 
difficult ruling for
communities,” says 
Law Center attorney
Jon Block. “Concerned 
residents will have to
get involved in an official capacity at the
beginning of a proceeding,or they may
lose their rights to participate later. It’s 
a tough thing to ask of New Mexicans who
don’thave expertise in how the system
works and lack the funds for the lawyers
and experts needed to challenge 
agency permitting decisions.” 
For more information on our 
greenhouse gas case, see page 2.
Also see nmelc.org for updates 
and background information.
In July, the Law Center and its members
scored their third victory of the year at the
state Supreme Court. In a unanimous 
decision, the justices ruled that parties which
participate in rulemakings can, by right, 
participate in appeals.
The case sprang
from an appeal filed
by PNM and our
state’s other major 
carbon polluters to
get “Rule 100” over-
turned. Rule 100 is
the carbon cap that
we and our client,
New Energy Economy,
won in 2010, after 
two years of work. 
The Supreme
Court’sdecision over-
turned a May ruling
by the Court of
Appeals to keep New
Energy Economy and
several other public
interest groups out of 
PNM’s appeal. We are now parties in that case.
“This is an important victory,” said attorney
Bruce Frederick. “If the Court of Appeals’s
opinion were allowed to stand, public-interest
groups would be barred from defending on
appeal the same regulations that they drafted
and persuaded an agency to adopt. Then
there would be little point in advocating for
good regulations in the first place.”
Ruling A Double-Edged Sword
While the ruling is a victory for New
Energy Economy and others, it also can be a
