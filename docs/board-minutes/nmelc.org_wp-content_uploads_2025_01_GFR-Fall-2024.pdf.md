NEW MEXI CO ENVI RONMENTAL LAW CENTER 
BY VIRGINIA NECOCHEA, PHD

 What started out as one rulemaking has resulted in three District
Court lawsuits, two cases in the Court of Appeals, multiple civil
rights complaints and continuous engagement with the
Environmental Health Department’s implementation of the rule.
Three lawsuits were filed in New Mexico district court resulting from the HEEI Rulemaking and are ongoing: Albuquerque-
Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board and the Board of County Commissioners of the County of Bernalillo v. City of
Albuquerque, New Mexico, challenging the validity of the Albuquerque City Council’s Resolution and Ordinance (calling for a
purge of the Air Board and a moratorium on their ability to take action to improve residents’ quality of life) and the City’s
illegal interference with the Rulemaking Proceeding; GCC Rio Grande, Inc., et al. v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air
Quality Control Board, City of Albuquerque, challenging the validity of the adopted HEEI Rule and the Air Board’s authority
and jurisdiction to adopt the HEEI Rule; and Mountain View Community Action et al. v. City of Albuquerque, also challenging
the validity and legality of the Council’s Resolution and Ordinance, as well as the City’s illegal interference with the
Rulemaking Proceeding and Complainants’ constitutional right to petition the government. 
In addition to the lawsuits pending before the district court, National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia
(NTESS), a subsidiary of Honeywell International and the contractor that operates Sandia National Lab, and a group of industry
permittees have filed appeals of the rule adopted by the Air Board to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, asserting, among other
things, that the Air Board did not have the authority to adopt such a rule. The Mountain View Coalition has intervened in the
appeals of the HEEI Rule to defend the Rule’s validity and will be submitting briefing to the Court in 2025.
NMELC, on behalf of the Mountain View Coalition, also submitted two requests to the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), asking EPA to review the City of Albuquerque’s and the City of Albuquerque’s Environmental Health Department’s
(EHD) compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the EPA’s implementing regulations (collectively, “Title
VI”). Specifically, the Mountain View Coalition filed a Title VI Complaint with EPA’s External Office of Civil Rights
Compliance, alleging that the City of Albuquerque violated Coalition members’ civil rights when the Albuquerque City Council
interfered with the December 2023 HEEI Rulemaking. The Coalition also submitted a Request for Compliance Review of
EHD, asking EPA to thoroughly investigate and review EHD’s compliance with Title VI. EHD has an ongoing history of civil
rights violations. In addition to EHD’s discriminatory conduct and interference with the HEEI rulemaking proceeding— 
Since the promulgation of the Health, Environment and Equity Impacts (HEEI) Rule in December 2023, members of the
Mountain View Coalition, made up of the Mountain View Neighborhood Association, Mountain View Community Action and
Friends of Valle de Oro, along with NMELC, have been hard at work continuing to fight for environmental justice and clean air
in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County. What started out as one rulemaking has resulted in three District Court lawsuits, two
cases in the Court of Appeals, multiple civil rights complaints and continuous engagement with the Environmental Health
Department’s implementation of the rule.
Mountain View Coalition/HEEI Ruling & Its Aftermath
CASE UPDATES
BY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY; KACEY
HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY & ANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY
 


In Southern New Mexico, Sunland Park and Santa Teresa residents continue to organize and hold the Camino Real Regional
Utility Authority (CRRUA) accountable for CRRUA’s ongoing provision of unsafe drinking water; lack of transparency and
accountability to community members; and continuous overcharging on resident’s utility bills. NMELC first began working
alongside community members in February 2024 on this critically important environmental justice issue, after residents
reached out to us following CRRUA’s failure to timely act, respond to, and notify residents of dangerous arsenic contamination
levels to the public water supply for over a week in 2023. The 2023 winter water crisis, however, is not the first time CRRUA
has failed to provide the public with safe drinking water and to notify residents of dangerous arsenic contamination levels, as
CRRUA has repeatedly violated federal and state drinking water laws and regulations for more than a decade, since 2012. 
Following the 2023 winter water crisis, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) launched an investigation into
CRRUA, finding CRRUA had injected an unknown amount of caustic soda into the public water supply and failed to properly
monitor and maintain its facilities, causing elevated pH and arsenic levels in the public water supply. NMED’s investigation
also revealed CRRUA had turned off and bypassed three of CRRUA’s four arsenic treatment facilities for the past year –
despite none of CRRUA’s operators and staff knowing how to properly and safely bypass these systems, as a third-party
evaluation into CRRUA’s facilities and operations revealed in August 2024.  
Despite CRRUA continuing to provide residents unsafe water, with arsenic contamination levels yet again above federal health
standards in June 2024, CRRUA raised residential water and wastewater rates on July 1, 2024, stating these rate increases were
necessary to ensure residents received water without significantly high arsenic levels. CRRUA ultimately shifted its
responsibility to provide safe and clean water to the public onto the residents of Sunland Park and Santa Teresa, a
predominantly Hispanic community, with 91% of residents identifying as Hispanic, and with many residents who are elderly,
working class or low-income. In fact, 52% of residents in Sunland Park and Santa Teresa are low income and, in Sunland Park,
specifically, EHD’s inaction leading up to and during the hearing in order to allow EHD’s discriminatory air permitting
practices to continue—EHD has been the subject of additional Title VI Complaints since 2014, when community groups filed a
civil rights complaint as a result of EHD and the Air Board’s failure to consider the cumulative impacts of health factors, social
factors, and additional air pollution burdens in already overburdened areas and EHD’s pattern and practice of discriminatory air
pollution permitting. NMELC and the Coalition are awaiting a decision from EPA on whether or not EPA will investigate
EHD’s ongoing noncompliance with Title VI. 
Finally, NMELC and the Mountain View Coalition have been engaging with EHD’s development of an Overburdened Areas
(OBA) Map. Under the HEEI Rule, EHD must develop a map of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County to be used in the air
pollution permitting process. The OBA Map, when completed, should show the most overburdened communities and, if a
polluting facility wants to locate in that area, it will need to apply additional pollution mitigation measures in order to operate
there. EHD’s initial version of the OBA Map inexplicably failed to include Mountain View as an overburdened area. NMELC
drafted comments on EHD’s mapping process, urging EHD to utilize techniques used for overburdened area maps across the
United States. On October 17, 2024, EHD released an updated version of the OBA Map, which now rightfully includes
Mountain View as an overburdened area. The final version of the OBA Map is expected to be released in January 2025.

and the New Mexico Open Meetings Act, as well as for fraud, waste, and abuse of public funds. On August 19, OSA
responded, publicly announcing OSA’s investigation into CRRUA and committing to include the allegations and evidence
provided within NMELC’s request into OSA’s investigation, as well as offering to consider providing residents with
opportunities to submit public comments on the investigation. 
However, OSA reneged on these statements, instead continuously failing to respond to community efforts to coordinate a
public listening session and public comment portal until, on September 24, OSA issued a letter stating it had concluded its
investigation into CRRUA and found no evidence to support findings of CRRUA’s misuse of public funds. Notably, OSA’s
closure letter was the first time OSA had notified NMELC that OSA had limited the scope of its investigation to one public
fund identified by NMED – in direct conflict with OSA’s previous statements to NMELC. Meanwhile, DOJ has yet to respond
or provide NMELC with any information about DOJ’s investigation into CRRUA. 
Within the same week as OSA’s abrupt closure of its investigation, on September 16, NMED and the New Mexico
Department of Health (DOH) hosted a public town hall in Sunland Park to speak directly with residents about their ongoing
issues with CRRUA. Both NMED Secretary James Kenney and NMDOH Secretary Patrick Allen attended. The public town
hall lasted nearly three hours, as residents shared with the state agencies their frustrations, experiences, and ongoing concerns
about the safety of CRRUA’s water supply, as well as the ongoing lack of transparency from CRRUA, NMED, and other state
officials. 
In response, NMED Secretary Kenney publicly committed to visiting residents’ homes the following day to collect water
samples to test and compare to CRRUA’s most recent test results. While NMED did visit residents’ homes on September 17,
and appeared to collect water samples, an Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) request by NMELC revealed NMED never
conducted any tests on residents’ water samples. 
 
 Despite CRRUA continuing to provide residents unsafe water, with
arsenic contamination levels yet again above federal health standards
in June 2024, CRRUA raised residential water and wastewater rates.
  
nearly one in three households are below the federal poverty line. CRRUA’s practice of shifting the financial burden of
providing residents the clean and safe drinking water they inherently have a right to thus further exacerbates the socioeconomic
barriers and disproportionate burdens Sunland Park and Santa Teresa residents already face and carry.
In response to CRRUA’s outrageous move to increase residential rates, community members posed several questions directly
to Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham at her public town hall in Las Cruces on July 25, requesting the state’s assistance and
leadership in protecting Sunland Park and Santa Teresa residents and holding CRRUA accountable. In response, the Governor
made several revealing statements and strong commitments, stating, “Money has gone to clean up the water, but that never
happened,” and promising to provide Southern New Mexico with clean water. 
On August 2, NMELC, working alongside community members and Empowerment Congress of Dona Ana County, filed a
request for the New Mexico Department of Justice (DOJ) and New Mexico Office of the State Auditor (OSA) to investigate
CRRUA for any and all violations of environmental protection laws, financial and consumer protection laws,

Southside Santa Fe Civil Rights Complaint & LanguageAccess
BY MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & KACEY HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY
On May 10, 2024, NMELC filed additional evidence of NMED’s intentional discrimination against New Mexicans with limited
English proficiency, showing that the hearing officer that denied a primarily-Spanish speaking resident the use of an interpreter
and ultimately issued an air pollution permit to an asphalt plant located less than one mile from low-income community
members and community members of color on Santa Fe’s Southside later denied a similar air pollution permit application for a
facility to be located more than one mile away from a primarily white, English-speaking affluent community in Alto, New
Mexico. 
Unfortunately, on July 30, 2024, ECRCO ultimately informed us that they would be closing the investigation into the
Complaint, stating that NMED had solved its discrimination problem by creating a powerpoint slide that could be used to
educate the public on how to use Zoom’s interpretation feature – completely ignoring NMED’s ongoing pattern of
discrimination against residents of New Mexico with limited English proficiency. Despite requests for reconsideration, ECRCO
has maintained its position. The fight continues, however, and the community on Santa Fe’s Southside, as well as NMELC, will
not give up on achieving language access for all. Most recently, NMELC alongside WildEarth Guardians, submitted a letter to
the state’s Oil Conservation Commission (OCC) opposing the OCC’s baseless decision to deny Spanish interpretation services
to members of the public during a rulemaking hearing which asked the OCC to better protect residents’ health from oil and gas
extraction.
To date, CRRUA continues to distribute discolored water to residents. Empowerment Congress continues to conduct
community surveys about residents’ water quality, revealing hundreds of residents with non-consumable water have received
utility bills costing thousands of dollars from CRRUA. Because CRRUA continues to fail to address residents’ concerns, and
New Mexico state agencies and officials continue to overlook these ongoing issues jeopardizing the health and wellbeing of
Southern New Mexico residents, NMELC and community members recently met, in October 2024, with EPA to request
federal oversight and involvement in the matter. As we move forward, NMELC is committed to working alongside our clients
and community members to continue applying pressure on all fronts and in all forms in order to secure and protect Southern
New Mexicans’ fundamental right to clean and safe drinking water.
 NMELC alongside WildEarth Guardians, submitted a letter to the state’s
Oil Conservation Commission opposing the OCC’s baseless decision to
deny Spanish interpretation services to members of the public 
during a rulemaking hearing.
  
On September 15, 2021, NMELC clients, with the advice of NMELC, filed a civil rights complaint with the Environmental
Protection Agency’s (EPA) External Civil Rights Compliance Office (ECRCO). Specifically, our client alleged that the New
Mexico Environment Department (NMED) discriminated against our client and their primarily Spanish-speaking community on
the Southside of Santa Fe by denying our client and others the use of a Spanish-language interpreter during an asphalt plant
hearing, in violation of their civil rights. EPA accepted the complaint for investigation and promptly began conversations to
resolve the issue with NMED.

When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published its Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis that proposed
removing uranium mine waste from the Quivira mine and disposing it in a state of the art disposal facility at the Red Rock
Landfill near Thoreau, the Red Water Pond Road community was cautiously optimistic. For the first time, a federal agency
had listened to their demands to remove mine waste from their community and off Navajo land rather than simply covering the
waste with dirt where it is. The community’s optimism quickly faded, however, when some Navajo Nation officials, people
from outside the Navajo Nation, and New Mexico politicians began challenging the EPA’s proposed disposal plan based on 
erroneous and outright false information. Among the falsehoods opponents spread were that the Red Rock Landfill disposal
facility would be taking mill tailings and high-level radioactive waste. Additionally, some Navajo Nation officials asserted –
without proof – that the Navajo Nation and Navajo allottees possess mineral rights underneath the proposed disposal facility. 
The reality is that the proposed disposal facility presents the least risky alternative for Quivira mine waste disposal. Uranium
mine waste is not highly radioactive and only presents a health hazard with chronic exposure, such as the exposure to the Red
Water Pond Road community members. Short-term exposures, such as accidental spills during transportation that are cleaned
up within hours or days, pose negligible risk. Further, disposing mine waste in a facility that is below surface grade, covered
and has leak detection systems is significantly safer than covering waste in place. 
The Red Water Pond Road community and the NMELC will continue to educate the public and decision makers about the
risks of disposing waste in a properly engineered facility instead of burying the waste in place. 
Additionally, NMELC has filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in federal district court to compel the U.S. Bureau of
Indian Affairs to release documents demonstrating whether the Navajo Nation (or anyone else) owns mineral rights beneath
the proposed disposal site. This will finally put to rest the specious claim that building a safe regional uranium mine waste
disposal facility would infringe on Navajo mineral rights. 
Augustin Plains Ranch Water Grab 
BY ANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY & MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY 
More than 100 community members from Catron County crowded in the courtroom in Reserve, New Mexico on April 5,
2024, to support the State Engineer’s denial of a permit requested by Augustin Plains Ranch to mine and hoard 54,000 acre
feet of water a year from the arid San Augustin Plains. The State Engineer denied the permit as speculative as Augustin Plains
Ranch had failed to show a genuine need to pump and hoard the groundwater. Agreeing APR’s request to transfer this water is
pure speculation, Judge Woods ruled from the bench denying the water transfer. 
On August 23, 2024, after hearing further argument on the oral ruling he made back in April, Judge Woods entered his written
order for summary judgment denying the water transfer. On September 24, 2024, APR appealed this court order to the NM
Court of Appeals, failing to take NO! For an answer and subjecting the citizens of Catron County to yet more costly litigation.
APR flagrantly continues to pursue its quest to pump precious groundwater from 30 proposed wells, which it hopes to pipe

CLIENT TESTIMONIALS
Hear what our brave and tireless clients are saying about how NMELC is helping them in their
fight for clean and safe drinking water:
“Partnering with the New Mexico Environmental Law Center amplifies work in the fight for clean
drinking water. Their legal expertise and dedication to environmental justice are invaluable in the
effort to hold CRRUA accountable and secure safe, arsenic-free water for the residents of Sunland
Park and Santa Teresa. Together, we are building a united front to protect community health and
preservation of their rights.” 
—Daisy Maldonado, Director, Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County
"Without NMELC’s help, we would not have made any progress. It is taking time, but at the end of
this long journey, something good will come out of it for the community." 
—Jose Saldana, CRRUA customer/Sunland Park resident
“Our organization is very grateful and thankful for the opportunity to have been in collaboration
with the NMELC team. With the support of NMELC, our organization has been able to move
forward with environmental justice in our communities. NMELC understands the importance of
scarce resources and what we need in our communities to make changes.” 
—VivianFuller,residentofSantaTeresa
NMELC is supporting Tewa Women United’s work and advocacy to prevent Los Alamos National Labs (LANL)from venting radioactive water vapor, called tritium, into the air in Los Alamos, New Mexico, which will impact13,179 individuals and several neighboring communities, Pueblo Nations, and private landowners within a thirty-mile radius of the proposed venting site. 
This summer, NMELC assisted Tewa Women United in drafting a letter to LANL urging them not to vent unlessand until their application demonstrated compliance with the ALARA principle – which requires radioactiveemissions to be “as low as reasonably achievable.” LANL has yet to do that, while also refusing to sample theheadspace of the flanged tritium waste containers. It is critical that LANL comprehensively evaluate and sample allaspects of its proposed venting because a very small dose produces a corresponding risk of cancer, posing asignificant threat to public health. In support of Tewa Women United’s ongoing advocacy efforts, NMELC has alsoassisted in the drafting, filing, and negotiations around several Freedom of Information Act Requests, which aredemanding information necessary to understand the severity of the public health and environmental threats posed byLANL’s project.
Working with Tewa Women United’s expert, Dr. Arjun Makhijani, we sent out a press release to help inform thepublic about two reports Tewa Women United commissioned, showing that a proposed tritium venting could havetriple the radiation exposure to infants and small children compared to adults. LANL submitted a ventingapplication to EPA Region 6, and that agency as well as the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) hasnot required LANL to consider impacts to infants or young children, in effect, not considering them to be “membersof the public.” Our combined efforts are an attempt to protect the most vulnerable from harmful health impacts inthe face of LANL’s impending tritium venting project, which could begin as early as Spring 2025. 
upstate to municipalities such as Belen and Rio Rancho. Through the entry of Judge Woods’ order in August 2024,NMELC fought alongside Catron County residents against APR’s water grab and to protect the water which residentsrely on for their homes, gardens and livestock. The long course of the APR litigation has included two speculative,nearly identical applications from APR to appropriate groundwater and multiple appeals to both the district court andthe NM Court of Appeals.  The ongoing litigation is a heartbreaking and significant drain on the lives and resourcesof the community members. APR has chosen to continue the drain by appealing Judge Woods’ well considereddecision to support the denial of its requested permit to mine the groundwater.
