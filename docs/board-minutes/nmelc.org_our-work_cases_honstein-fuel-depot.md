Case Work: Air
Honstein Fuel Depot
LOCATION: Albuquerque, NM
INITIATION DATE: June 2014
CLIENTS/PARTNERS: SouthWest Organizing Project
OPPOSING PARTIES: Honstein Oil
STATUS: Closed
ATTORNEY: Eric Jantz
SUMMARY:
The Honstein Oil Co. operated a 6,000 gallon fuel facility in the San Jose neighborhood for decades without a permit. It finally obtained that permit in 2013, which led the Law Center and its clients to challenge the City/County Air Quality Control Board for failing to take into account “cumulative air quality impacts” (how all of the air pollution in the neighborhood affects residents – not just the emissions from one facility) and therefore failing to uphold their mandate under the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act to ‘prevent or abate air pollution.’ The City Environmental Health Department claims it is too poor to monitor air quality in the neighborhood, yet spent more than $100,000 on attorneys and experts to challenge our clients. An appeal hearing was held in early 2017. In June 2018, Honstein relocated to Broadway Blvd SE and submitted a modified permit for double the annual throughput.
