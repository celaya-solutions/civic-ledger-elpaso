Take a peek into the worldwide Santa network where Santas train for the hardest questions
SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) — Santa can’t be everywhere at once, and even Santa knows that.
“Santa needs helpers all around the world,” one Santa said.
When he's not in the workshop or delivering toys, Santa logs on. With one click, hundreds of Santas from around the world pop onto the screen, and you can hear the excitement in the room. "Look at all the Santas!"
These Santas are part of the Worldwide Santa Network - a virtual meeting place where Santa's helpers come together to learn, share and support one another with one shared goal: To spread that Christmas spirit.

One of those Santas lives right here in Utah. When asked if he was the real Santa, his answer came with a checklist.
"He would have to have a real beard. I have a beard," he said. "He would have to have the right suit. I have the right suit."
And this Utah Santa said he has never met a cookie he didn't like. He just might be the real thing.
But behind the laughs, the network's mission is serious, because the questions kids ask are not always easy.
On the call, one Santa shared a moment that stopped everyone.
"I got the question over the weekend, can you bring my mommy back? That was a first for me, and it was tough," he said.
That's where the network comes in. Helping Santas answer the hard questions with care and making sure every child feels seen, heard and loved.
Part of the training focuses on inclusion, "how to better serve every person, especially those with special needs."
For this Santa, that mission is personal. He said he has a grandson who is on the autism spectrum. He spends much of his time in Utah working with nonprofits that serve children on the spectrum and said one visit changed him.
"It was the best experience because I walked into the classroom," he recalled. "To see kids' eyes excited, I probably got more hugs that day than all my time."
With a little help from Santa's helpers across the world, that kindness reaches more families and more kids than any one Santa ever could alone.
Santa's message this season is simple.
“Don’t worry about whether you’re on the naughty or nice list,” he said. “Go out there and be kind. And if you’re a kind person, you don’t need to worry which list you’re on.”
