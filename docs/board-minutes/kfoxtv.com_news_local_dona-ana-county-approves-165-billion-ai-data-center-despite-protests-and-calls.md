Doña Ana County approves $165 billion AI data center despite protests and calls for delay
LAS CRUCES, N.M. (KFOX14/CBS4) — Dona Ana County Commissioners approved the $165 billion artificial intelligence data center in Santa Teresa.
On Friday, during a county meeting, Project Jupiter was approved in a four-to-one vote, amidst community protest.
County leaders emphasized that Friday's vote is not a final approval but rather a decision on whether to authorize the issuance of industrial revenue bonds.
County documents indicate that commissioners will consider authorizing up to $165 billion in these bonds.
The project, which is led by Borderplex Digital Assets, includes plans for a data center and related facilities, which leaders say could bring thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of permanent positions.
"Project Jupiter represents the largest potential commercial project in Doña Ana County's history, and actually one of the largest in the state's history," said Stephen Lopez, Doña Ana County Assistant County Manager. He added that the project could bring high-paying jobs and workforce development opportunities to southern New Mexico.
However, not all local leaders are convinced.

The City of Sunland Park requested a delay in Friday's vote.
Mayor Javier Perea expressed concerns about the project's impact on the city, stating, "We're finding out information at the same time that, you know, press releases are being released and that doesn't cover a lot of information."
Furthermore, community activists, like Daisy Maldonado of Empower NM, also wanted the process to be paused.
"To get our commissioners to hear our voice, and for them to really take our concerns seriously, so that they don't vote yes on Friday but in fact delay it to get more information," said Maldonado.
Maldonado highlighted the lack of awareness among residents about the project and pointed out missing analyses.
"There's a missing economic analysis, there's a missing environmental analysis, and certainly, there's a missing community voice, and community buy-in for this project," she said.
"There's other ways that they can mitigate this, delay the vote, they could vote no, and guess what, the companies can come back and apply again."
