Augustin Plains Ranch Water Rights Application
LOCATION: Catron County near Datil, NM
INITIATION DATE: 2008
CLIENTS/PARTNERS: Gila Conservation Coalition, three homeowner/landowner associations, and over 100 landowners and ranchers
OPPOSING PARTIES: Augustin Plains Ranch, LLC
STATUS: Ongoing
ATTORNEYS: Maslyn Locke
Summary:
Since 2008, Augustin Plains Ranch, LLC has been pursuing the most highly contested water grab in New Mexico history. It wants more than 17 billion gallons of publicly owned water and has never said what it will do with it, except sell it to someone, somewhere, for something. We persuaded the State Engineer to deny the application in 2012, and then persuaded a state District Court judge to rule against the Ranch’s appeal. On August 1, 2018, the State Engineer denied the most recent application as speculative. If we do not stop this privatization scheme once and for all, the precedent it would set could dry up rural communities throughout New Mexico.
