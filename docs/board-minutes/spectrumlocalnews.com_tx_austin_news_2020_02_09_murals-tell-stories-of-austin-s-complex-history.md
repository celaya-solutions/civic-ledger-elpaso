AUSTIN, Texas — In 1950, a University of Texas professor painted a fresco of praying hands and ghostly orbs around the doorway of a church off Guadalupe Street. A fresco is a painting done on wet plaster so that the colors penetrate and become fixed. The piece, known as Creation (or sometimes Genesis), has been called Austin’s first mural.
University Baptist Church commissioned nationally acclaimed artist Seymour Fogel to create the piece. Fogel was a former apprentice to the famous Mexican painter Diego Rivera in the 1930s. According to reports, Fogel’s mural Creation initially shocked viewers. But over time, Austinites began to embrace this piece.
Eventually, more blank walls in Austin were covered in art that reflected the surrounding community. Some of the most well-known mural artists in Austin are Kerry Awn, Matthew Bonifacio Rodriguez, Chris Rogers, and Raul Valdez. While many remain, some important Austin murals are long gone. All public murals are under the constant threat from nature, vandalism, and property owners who want to paint over them.
To help people enjoy these pieces of wall art while they’re here, we’ve created a map of some of Austin’s key murals.
