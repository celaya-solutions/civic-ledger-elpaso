Who is YouTuber Nick Shirley, who shined a light on alleged fraud at Minnesota daycares?
WASHINGTON (TNND) — Nick Shirley, a YouTuber who describes himself as an independent journalist brought alleged Minnesota fraud to the forefront of a national conversation by using his own platform on X to do so.
On Dec. 26, 2025, Shirley, 23, posted a 42-minute video where he and his team visited multiple daycare centers in Minneapolis that appeared to be vacant.
He alleged that millions of taxpayer dollars were funding these vacant centers, alluding that there was tons of fraud based on what he recorded.
“Here is the full 42 minutes of my crew and I exposing Minnesota fraud, this might be my most important work yet,” he wrote on X.
“We uncovered over $110,000,000 in ONE day.”
Following his reporting, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would be freezing childcare payments to Minnesota as a result of all the fraud.
When CBS News addressed Shirley’s reporting, CBS reporter Jonah Kaplan said that his reporting didn’t have proper context and that many daycares were written up for safety violations and it’s not the same thing as fraud.
“Why don’t you go to a day care yourself and you will see it first hand Or you can just keep yapping on selfie mode,” Shirley fired back at Kaplan on X.
He also recently asked for prayers because he said as a result of his reporting, he's getting death threats.
“This is not a joke, they actually want to kill me,” Shirley wrote on X. “In all seriousness please include me in your prayers.”
He posted a picture of a screenshot of someone threatening to kill him on X.
Shirley has a YouTube channel with 1.37 million subscribers. He does man-on-the-street interviews and has traveled to different countries for content.
One of his videos is titled, “Inside Paris Dangerous Migrant Crisis.”
He is from Utah and served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Chile.
In November of 2025, he was awarded the citizen journalist of the year award at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.
“An honor to win the citizen journalist of the year award last night,” he wrote in an Instagram post. “All of you make it possible so thank you once again, God bless.”
