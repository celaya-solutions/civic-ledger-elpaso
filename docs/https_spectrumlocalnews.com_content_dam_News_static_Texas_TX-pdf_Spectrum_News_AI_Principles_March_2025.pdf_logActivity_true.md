Generative AI Principles 
 
Spectrum News centers human oversight, integrity and judgement in everything we do. Our 
journalists vet and rigorously fact-check all information we report, in service of our mission to 
provide a trustworthy source of unbiased news. Our journalists are thinkers, curators and 
members of their communities, and we will not use AI to replace those essential functions.     
  
While we recognize the opportunities artificial intelligence could present to advance our journalism 
and better serve our audience, we also understand the significant risks and challenges. These are 
the principles that guide our work related to AI.   
  
1. Journalists at the Center 
• Any experimentation with AI tools is done carefully and thoughtfully, guided by 
leaders who prioritize journalistic ethics and human review.   
• AI tools, like other tools long used in the service of reporting and delivering the 
news, are managed by our journalists, which includes fact-checking and 
scrutinizing any material for accuracy and bias. Our journalists are ultimately 
responsible for everything we report, and Spectrum News Journalism Standards 
Guidelines require several levels of human review before publication.  
• We may use AI to check grammar or suggest ideas for headlines, summaries or 
social media promotional text, but any suggestions are considered and then edited 
by our reporters, editors and producers, who are responsible for what is published.   
  
2. Transparency with our Audience 
• We publish and update these principles, so our audience knows what guides our 
use of AI and that nothing is published without human review.  
• We clearly label any content produced by AI that is used as examples in stories 
about AI. For video stories, that means both verbal and on-screen graphic 
disclosures, and for our digital stories, any AI generated illustration will include both 
a written disclosure and watermark on the image. We are particularly careful when 
reporting on so-called deepfakes, which are often designed to sow confusion. If we 
decide there is significant news value in sharing clips, we ensure we are extremely 
clear that it was created with AI. 
• Spectrum News does not use AI to add or subtract any elements of photos, video or 
audio. We do not put any confidential information into AI tools. 
 
3. Empowering Excellent Journalism 
• The purpose of any tool is to enable us to improve our journalism and serve our 
audience more effectively. This includes tools that use AI. We are always seeking to 
improve our processes so that our journalists can focus on uncovering, verifying 
and reporting the truth, producing compelling stories and serving the local audience 
with accurate and unbiased information.
