Dear Supporters and Community, 
Although we continue to endure the many shifts andchallenges stemming from the ongoing pandemic, I amhappy to share that our work at the New MexicoEnvironmental Law Center continues strong. In thisGreen Fire Report, you will meet our newest staff andread the latest case updates from our attorneys.  I’ve officially been with NMELC for 7 months and aseach day passes, I reflect on what an honor andprivilege it is to work with such dedicated staff whoare deeply committed to working alongside our mostimpacted communities across the state in fighting fortheir fundamental right to clean air, water, and land.  
Now, with the change in administration, we are glad tosee environmental justice treated as a priority. Evenmore, we are encouraged to witness howenvironmental racism is being intentionally named inthe larger national narrative.  
People who have been working on environmentaljustice issues and with frontline communities fullyunderstand that you cannot achieve environmentaljustice without naming and centering environmentalracism. It is vital to understand that naming...(continues on page 2)

NEW MEXI CO ENVI RONMENTAL LAW CENTER

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
Just north of Milan, the Homestake Uranium Mill, which closed in 1990, has left behind a total of 22 milliontons of uranium-laden waste, in two piles—both unlined and uncapped. One of them is a mile long and 400feet high. This mesa of highly toxic rubble has been seeping uranium and other contaminants intogroundwater for decades, forcing the residents of the area to leave their homes, family farms and ranches,because it was not safe to live there. This is yet another story of a community destroyed by the uraniumindustry.The Homestake Mill operated from 1958 until 1990, processing uranium ore into “yellow cake,” the form ofuranium usable for nuclear energy. It operated under a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC), which included a requirement that the contamination caused by the mill would be cleaned up afterthe mine closed. Water contamination from the uranium mill was first detected in 1961. In 1983, theHomestake Mill was placed on the National Priorities List, making it a Superfund Site. The EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) is responsible to ensure the clean up of Superfund Sites. So now, both the NRC andthe EPA have responsibility for the clean up. During the decades of so-called “clean up,” the contamination has become worse. What started as thecontamination of one aquifer—the shallow, Alluvial Aquifer—has grown into the contamination of fiveaquifers—the Alluvial, Upper Chinle, Middle Chinle, Lower Chinle, and even the pristine San Andres Aquifer.Not surprising, since Homestake Barrick Gold had been flushing the large tailings pile with water, pushingthe contamination out of the pile and into the ground and water below. Rather than applying the best science and technology and implementing a clean up plan that would actuallywork, Homestake Barrick Gold is now asking the EPA and the NRC to let them off the hook. They say theyhave tried and failed to clean up and they want to walk away from the mess they created.  We are workingwith our clients, the Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment (MASE), and the Blue Water ValleyDownstream Alliance, to try to convince the EPA and the NRC to hold Homestake Barrick Gold’s feet to thefire and to insist that their highly toxic massive mess is cleaned up. Our fresh water resources are far tooprecious to allow anything else.
environmental racism should not be interpreted as a personal attack.  Talking openly about racism is aninvitation for all of us to confront this moment of racial reckoning and strive for transformation.I end this with the following question: What does this mean for people who want to support the movement,especially in this momentous time? It means listening and learning from the most impacted communities. Itmeans standing alongside communities in their demands for environmental justice. It means that we are willingto open our hearts and minds to real change and that we will take every opportunity to hold our leadersaccountable to those who have endured the most harm. It means that we will have the courage and the patienceto continue on this life-long path toward achieving true justice. 
I thank every one of you for your ongoing support of NMELC— we wouldn’t be here without you! We sincerelyhope that you continue the journey walking alongside us as we remain dedicated to providing high quality legalservices and support to communities across New Mexico who are fighting for environmental justice.

Proposed Santolina Development Update
For the Law Center’s clients, the Law Center appealed those Board decisions to the District Court inAlbuquerque. The District Court: 1) affirmed the Board’s approval of the Level A Master Plan; 2) reversed theBoard’s approval of the zone map amendment; and 3) refused to review the Board’s approval of the SantolinaLevel A Development Agreement.
The Law Center appealed the District Court’s decision affirming the Board’s approval of the Level A MasterPlan and refusal to review the Board’s approval of the Development Agreement to the Court of Appeals.WALH and the Board appealed the District Court’s decision reversing the Board’s approval of the zone mapamendment to the Court of Appeals. 
In December of 2020, the Court of Appeals affirmed all of the District Court rulings, which means that WALHdoes not have the zone map amendment that it needs for Santolina.   Recently WALH (joined by the Board)asked the State Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals' ruling invalidating the Board's approval of thezone map amendment. We are resisting WALH's effort. We also have asked the Supreme Court to review theCourt of Appeals’ rulings upholding the Board’s approval of the Master Plan and the Development Agreement.
Second set of cases
These cases involve the Board’s 2017 approval of the Santolina Level B.1 Master Plan and the Board’s 2018approval of the Santolina Level B.1 Development Agreement. On behalf of our clients, the Law Centerappealed these two Board decisions to the District Court, but the District Court affirmed those two Boarddecisions. Again on behalf of our clients, the Law Center appealed those District Court decisions to the StateCourt of Appeals. The cases have been briefed, and we are waiting for decisions by the Court of Appeals.
This involves two sets of cases. Kendra Palmer, JaimiePark, and I worked on the first set of cases, and KendraPalmer, Gail Evans and I are working on the second set ofcases.First set of casesIn 2015, the Bernalillo County Board of CountyCommissioners approved: 1) the zone map amendment sought by WesternAlbuquerque Land Holdings (“WALH”) changing thezoning where the Santolina development is proposedfrom Agricultural to Planned Communities; 2) the Level A Master Plan for the proposed Santolinadevelopment; and 3) the Santolina Level A DevelopmentAgreement between WALH and the Board.
Honstein Oil Company
Abuquerque/Bernalillo County Joint Air QualityControl Board’s (Control Board) permit allowing theHonstein Oil Company to operate a bulk fuelterminal in Albuquerque’s South Valley threatenscommunity health. Residents of the South Valleystruggle with chronic health conditions linked to airpollution which will be exacerbated by Honstein’sactivities.  
The Law Center's clients appealed the ControlBoard's decision, arguing thatAlbuquerque/Bernalillo County's air pollutionregulatory agency had a statutory obligation toconsider public health when issuing individualpollution permits.  Unfortunately, in October 2020,the state court of appeals sided with the ControlBoard and rejected our clients' appeal.  
Despite the setback, the Law Center will continue towork with impacted communities to address thedisproportionate concentration of polluting facilitiesin their neighborhoods. A coalition of Southside residents has formed inresponse to concerns about public health. Manyresidents see the location of so many pollutingbusinesses near their homes and area schools, parksand athletic fields as environmental racism.
If the air pollution permit is issued, as anticipated,then the applicant will apply to Santa Fe County forpermission to consolidate its two existing asphaltplants into a single plant with the right to operate24/7, 365 days per year.
Southside residents and concerned residents of SantaFe are encouraged to voice their concerns at thepublic hearing for the Air Quality Permit on March 22.

In early 2019, then District Court Judge (now State Supreme Court Justice) Shannon Bacon entered adecision in our clients’ favor denying Aquifer Science’s appeal from a ruling by the State Engineer dismissingAquifer Science’s application to appropriate ground water from the Sandia Basin and a small part of the Rio  Grande Basin.  Later, in early 2020 District Court Judge Clay Campbell entered an order granting our clients their costs,including the fees paid by our clients to their experts.  The order that our clients’ costs be paid provided thatAquifer Science and the State Engineer are jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the costs,which means that each of them – Aquifer Science and the State Engineer – is liable to our clients for theentire amount of the costs, although our clients can only recover their costs once.  
In the summer of 2019, Seventh Judicial District CourtJudge Matthew Reynolds denied the appeal that theAugustin Plains Ranch filed from the State Engineer’s denialof the Ranch’s application to appropriate 54,000 acre feet ofground water per year from the San Agustin Basin.  TheRanch then filed an appeal to the State Court of Appeals,and the attorneys for the Ranch filed the Ranch’s Brief inChief in October of 2020.  
Following the filing of the Ranch’s Brief in Chief, we werescheduled to file our Answer Brief on behalf of our clientsduring November of 2020.  Due to two requests forextensions of time that were granted by the Court ofAppeals, our Answer Brief is now due on March 12th.

In 2019, the Trump administration issued final regulations defining the term “waters of the United States” under thefederal Clean Water Act. This definition is a crucial one; it establishes the scope of Clean Water Act jurisdiction,permitting, and water quality protection. The Trump administration rule, among other things, completely eliminatedClean Water Act jurisdiction and protection over all ephemeral streams.This rule leaves some 90% of New Mexicostreams unprotected.In June 2020, the Law Center filed a lawsuit on behalf of our clients against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the agencies that had issued the rule. The lawsuit challenges the rule as unlawfulon several substantive grounds. The federal agencies have sought a stay of the proceedings while officials in the Bidenadministration decide whether to repeal or replace the rule. In addition, in the Law Center filed an amicus brief in afederal appeals court supporting the State of Colorado in a similar challenge to the Trump rule.

Waters of the United States
New Mexico Terminal Services applied for a permitfrom Albuquerque Environmental HealthDepartment (EHD) to construct a hot mix batchasphalt plant at 9615 Broadway SE, just south of theValle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge in theMountain View neighborhood. 
The proposed plant would be built next to the RioGrande river and the bosque, the beloved greencorridor that runs through the state’s largest city.Mountain View is a community of approximately4,000 residents, who are predominantly low-incomepeople of color.
The neighborhood has been saturated with dozens ofindustrial companies that have contaminated the air,water and land with toxins and hazardous wastes. Infact, Mountain View has been designated by the EPA(along with San Jose, its neighbor to the north) as anenvironmental justice community, meaning it hasalready been identified by the federal government asan impacted community facing the disparate impactsof environmental pollution. A hearing has beenscheduled for May, 2021.
Mountain View 
Rio Grande Resources announced the closure of
the Mount Taylor Mine in December 2019. NMELC
staff are in the process of incorporating our clients’
comments as well as the public's concerns in the
Rio Grande Resources Corporation’s proposed
Mount Taylor Mine close-out plan. 
We and our clients continue to press state
agencies to force Rio Grande Resources to conduct
the most thorough surface reclamation possible.  
The Law Center and our clients are also pressing
the state Environment Department to require Rio
Grande Resources to identify the source of
uranium groundwater contamination and restore
groundwater quality to pre-mining conditions.

This case involves a lawsuit that the Law Center filedfor Nuclear Watch New Mexico — which is a privatenon-profit organization — against the U.S. Departmentof Energy.  The lawsuit – which was filed in the U.S.District Court for the District of New Mexico – soughtreversal of the agreement made by the U.S.Department of Energy and the New MexicoEnvironment Department (during the Martinezadministration) to replace the 2005 Consent Order forcleanup of pollution at Los Alamos National Laboratorywith a much weaker 2016 Consent Order. 
Specifically, the lawsuit sought to:  1) require reinstatement of the 2005 Consent Order and 2) require the U.S.Department of Energy to pay the penalties that it owed for failure to meet deadlines set by the 2005 Consent Orderduring the time that the 2005 Consent Order was still in effect. 
Several years ago, the U.S. District Court Judge dismissed Nuclear Watch New Mexico’s claim that the 2005 ConsentOrder should be reinstated.  However, the Judge refused to dismiss Nuclear Watch’s claim that the U.S. Department ofEnergy should be required to pay the penalties owed for failure to meet deadlines under the 2005 Consent Orderbefore that Consent Order was superseded by the 2016 Consent Order.  
Nuclear Watch New Mexico, the Law Center and our co-counsel John Stroud (who is a private attorney in Santa Fe)have been engaged in discussions with the U.S. Department of Energy to determine whether we can settle NuclearWater New Mexico’s claim that the U.S. Department of Energy must pay the penalties that are at issue.  Thosesettlement negotiations have recently been joined by the New Mexico Environment Department – which intervened inthe litigation – and they are ongoing.  The negotiations are confidential.

Nuclear Watch New Mexico v. U.S. Department of Energy
The Kirtland Air Force Base’s jet fuel spill, resulting in aplume of 5 - 25 million gallons of leaked fuel, hascontaminated groundwater, threatening a major source ofdrinking water in the Albuquerque metro area. 
In February 2020, we filed a legal complaint on behalf of ourclients, because the Air Force has neither fully defined theextent of the Kirtland Air Force Base fuel spill, norimplemented procedures to clean up the groundwater.
In fact, no written work plan or schedule for clean-up exists.

 The United States has, on behalf of the Air Force, moved to dismiss our lawsuit. On April 26th, we filed a brief inresponse to their motion to dismiss. NMELC presented arguments in a July 21st hearing on the United States’ motion todismiss our lawsuit. The court has not yet ruled on the motion.
"PAWA UNDERSTANDS THAT WITHOUT WATER
THERE IS NO LIFE, JOBS, OR ECONOMY, THAT
THE MINE SUPPORTERS WHO LOOK TO JOB
CREATION HAVE NOT YET UNDERSTOOD THEIR
OWN NEED FOR WATER, AND THAT THE

(PAWA)
The Tererro Mine, another proposed mining operation, would be located in the Upper Pecos River watershed, near thesite of the old Tererro Mine. The old mine, which operated in the 1930s, has left behind a legacy of tailings and minewastes that continue to threaten the Pecos River. The proposed new mining operation would extract copper, zinc, lead,gold, and silver. So far, the mining company has sought regulatory approval only for mineral exploration activities,which includes the drilling of up to 30 borings several thousand feet deep.
The Law Center and its client are part of a coalition of environmental, wildlife, community, and tribal organizationsopposing the mine. The coalition has advocated for strong conditions in the exploration permit under the New Mexico  Mining Act. A public hearing on the exploration permit will probably be held in the spring of 2021. In addition, thecoalition has requested that the U.S. Forest Service conduct an environmental assessment of the exploration proposalunder the National Environmental Policy Act. The Forest Service, in response, has reversed its earlier position andagreed to conduct the assessment.
Copper Flat Mine
The Copper Flat Mine is a proposed open-pit copper mine near
Hillsboro in Sierra County. Mining operations, if they occur,
would have the potential to contaminate groundwater through
naturally-occurring fractures in bedrock, posing significant
threats to water quality and fragile ecosystems. The mine will
also leave behind a large pit lake that will exceed water quality
standards. The lake will draw in surrounding groundwater and
cause it to evaporate.
In collaboration with clients and other grassroots partners, the
Law Center is working in several forums to oppose the mine and
to mitigate its potential harmful effects. First, the Law Center has
challenged the groundwater discharge permit for the mine in
agency regulatory proceedings. In 2018, we appealed the permit
to the New Mexico Court of Appeals.
The case has been briefed, and we are awaiting a decision from
the court. Second, in a separate agency proceeding, we have
challenged the operating permit for the mine under the New
Mexico  Mining Act. In early 2020, responding to the Law
Center’s arguments, New Mexico state regulators determined
that the mine operator had not demonstrated it has sufficient
water rights to operate and reclaim the proposed mine. 
The permit apparently will not be issued until the operator makes
this demonstration. Third, we are opposing the transfer of water
rights to the mine in proceedings before the Office of the State
Engineer and in the New Mexico Court of Appeals.

LEGISLATIVE  UPDATES
"Produced" Water aka Use of Water in Oil & Gas Operations —TABLED, co-sponsored by Sen. Antoinette Sedillo
Lopez and Sen. Liz Stefanics, sought to protect fresh water from being used in fracking and would have
prohibited oil and gas waste water from being used off of oil fields. Although SB 86 passed its first committee,
Senate Conservation, it was unfortunately tabled in Senate Judiciary, in a unanimous vote that included the
Senate Democrats. The reality is that the oil and gas industry plays a huge role and has a major influence at the
Roundhouse. Organizations and coalitions are strategizing on next steps to address the stronghold of oil and
gas and to address what have been viewed as problematic processes at the legislative session. The bottom line
is that frontline communities remain vulnerable to environmental contamination from "produced" water.
This bill creates private rights of action in the environmental statutes: the Air Quality Control Act, the Water
Quality Act, the Hazardous Waste Act, the Solid Waste Act, and the Oil and Gas Act (a private right of action
provision already exists in the Mining Act). Rep. Georgene Louis is sponsoring this bill. HB-50 would be an
important step towards environmental justice in New Mexico; it ensures that individuals can sue to protect the
environment, rather than leaving enforcement solely to the state agencies.
HB-50  Private Right of Action
SB-8  Local Government Air Quality Regulations
This bill removes the clauses in the Air Quality Control Act and the Hazardous Waste Act that bar the
Environmental Improvement Board, local governments and the NM Environment Department from adopting
regulations that are “more stringent than" federal regulations. This legislation would make it easier for the
Environment Department to regulate ozone precursors (VOCs and NOx) from oil and gas production. Reducing
VOC and NOx emissions effectively reduces methane emissions, and combats climate change. Sen. Peter Wirth
and Sen. Linda Lopez are co-sponsoring this bill, and Rep. Andres Romero will carry it in the House.
SB-296  Increasing Penalties for Environmental Violations
SB-86  Protect Our Water Bill
This bill increases the Maximum Civil Penalties that can be collected under the environmental statutes by
adjusting the penalty amounts for inflation that has occurred since the passing of each penalty provision. This
bill covers the penalty provisions in the Air Quality Control Act, the Water Quality Act, the Hazardous Waste
Act, the Solid Waste Act, and the Mining Act. The bill doubles the maximum penalties under these laws. It does
not cover the Oil and Gas Act because that Act’s penalty provision was amended in 2019. Right now, the same
monetary penalties have been on the books for 30–40 years. Monetary penalties are our best way to push
polluters to change their practices and not violate New Mexico’s environmental protection laws. Sen. Brenda G.
McKenna and Sen. Jeff Steinborn are co-sponsoring this bill.
The Climate Solutions Act (HB 9) establishes nation-leading carbon pollution-reduction targets to benefit
current and future generations while ensuring that all New Mexicans will benefit from the increased jobs
provided in a green economy. The bill ensures that most impacted and historically disadvantaged communities
have a seat at the table to create a more diversified and resilient economy as we move to a net-zero-carbon
future. The bill is sponsored by Reps. Melanie Stansbury and Angelica Rubio; HB 9 passed through House
Energy, Environment & Natural Resources Committee and, after being rolled over three times in a week, it has
stalled on a vote in the House State Government, Elections & Indian Affairs Committee. There is a shift by
proponents of the bill to support HB 297 and SB 112 which fund just transition and energy targets.
HB-9  The Climate Solutions Act
