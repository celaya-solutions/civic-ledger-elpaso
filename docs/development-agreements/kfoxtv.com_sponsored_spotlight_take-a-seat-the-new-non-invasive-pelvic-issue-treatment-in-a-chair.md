Take a seat: The new, non-invasive pelvic issue treatment in a chair
Millennium Health & Wellness, led by world-renowned Dr. Brian Hesser, has introduced Emsella to its growing suite of non-surgical wellness therapies. This powerful addition aligns with Dr. Hesser’s mission to help patients achieve optimal health through innovative, non-invasive treatments.
Since its founding, Millennium Health & Wellness has built a reputation for offering advanced, patient-centered care. Dr. Hesser combines chiropractic expertise, regenerative medicine, hormone optimization, softwave and shockwave therapies, red-light therapy, spinal decompression, and physical therapy. The integration of Emsella strengthens the clinic’s approach to pelvic health, bladder control, lower back stability, and overall core strength—areas often underserved in traditional care models.
Emsella is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared device that uses high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology to stimulate thousands of supramaximal pelvic floor muscle contractions in a single 30-minute session. This level of engagement can’t be achieved through traditional exercises alone, making it an effective option for people seeking improved pelvic floor strength, better bladder control, reduced pelvic and lower back pain, enhanced intimate health, and increased gluteal and hamstring strength. Treatments are completed fully clothed, require no downtime, and are comfortable for patients.
Emsella is not just for women. Men can also experience pelvic floor weakness, often due to aging, prostate issues, or lifestyle changes. Strengthening the pelvic floor can help men improve bladder control, reduce urgency, support post-prostate recovery, and enhance sexual function. In fact, Emsella has been shown to support men dealing with erectile dysfunction (ED) by improving blood flow and muscular control, creating a strong foundation for pelvic health and overall physical performance.
“This is one of those rare technologies that truly changes quality of life,” Dr. Hesser said. “It’s simple, comfortable, and it works. We see patients—men and women—who thought they’d just have to live with bladder leaks, urgency, pain, or weakness. With Emsella, we’re giving them back confidence, control, and strength.”
This new therapy complements Millennium’s commitment to restorative, non-surgical solutions. Strengthening the pelvic floor can directly benefit spinal stability, posture, and mobility. By activating and strengthening the gluteal and hamstring muscle groups, Emsella can also help reduce chronic pelvic and lower back pain, providing additional support for individuals recovering from injury or dealing with structural weakness.
Under Dr. Hesser’s leadership, Millennium Health & Wellness continues to expand its offerings to provide patients with innovative, non-invasive ways to take back control of their health. By integrating technologies like Emsella, the clinic is reinforcing its position as a regional leader in functional and regenerative wellness.
