Former WWE star Dolph Ziggler embraces new wrestling chapter with TNA
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — Nick Nemeth, known to wrestling fans as former WWE legend Dolph Ziggler, recently reflected on his 19-year career in the WWE and his decision to move on.
"Nineteen years is a long time to be somewhere," Nemeth said, noting the lack of breaks and injuries during his tenure. He expressed a desire to explore wrestling opportunities worldwide, including in Japan and Mexico.
Vince McMahon allowed him to exit his WWE contract early, enabling Nemeth to travel and wrestle independently. Now with TNA, Nemeth appreciates the flexibility to perform while pursuing other interests.
"With TNA, they gave me the option... you can still travel the world and do everything great," he said. Nemeth praised the camaraderie within TNA and the passionate wrestling fans in Texas, where he will perform at the El Paso County Coliseum Dec. 5-7. Looking ahead, Nemeth remains committed to wrestling, saying, "I'm in the best shape of my life... until that day comes, I'm ready to go."
