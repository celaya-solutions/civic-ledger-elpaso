West Microgrid: latitude 31.82333 dec deg North and longitude -106.713056 dec deg West,
approximately 4.1 miles southwest of Santa Teresa in Doña Ana County.
East Microgrid: latitude 31.818333 dec deg North and longitude -106.679167 dec deg West,
Approximately 3.6 miles south of Santa Teresa in Doña Ana County.
