Spanks for the memories! Why Timothée Chalamet refuses to use a butt double
Friends, there are two words you should never say around Timothée Chalamet: “butt double.”
Why? Pretty obvious. The "Marty Supreme" star is a serious actor who doesn't shy away from being repeatedly spanked with a ping-pong paddle.
Just to be clear, the aforementioned spanking was strictly business-related, not for personal pleasure.
So, don't you dare drag Kylie Jenner into this wholesome story!
Listen to what "Shark Tank" judge Kevin O’Leary had to say about his acting debut in the Josh Safdie-directed dramedy.
O’Leary told Variety that the movie features a scene in which his character vigorously spanks Marty Mauser (Chalamet) with a paddle.
No spoilers, just know the bottom-smacking scene is essential to the on-screen humiliation of Chalamet’s very cocky character.
Well, apparently Timothée is a risk-taker à la Tom Cruise because his butt does its own dang stunts.
O’Leary explained to the outlet, “When it came time to whack him, there was a stunt a--. There was a double."
However, O’Leary confessed that didn't sit well with Chalamet, recalling, "He said he’ll do it himself. He didn’t want some other ass immortalized.”
Folks, that is what we call "dedication to the craft." Timmy put not one, but two cheeks on the line for his fans.
O’Leary also admitted he started with a fake paddle, but when it broke, he switched to a real one. The price of fame stings.
Another painful tidbit from the Variety story: filming the spanking scene took hours, and Safdie insisted on 40 takes, going until 4 a.m.
“Josh was saying, ‘You’ve got to wind up harder.' I was really whacking him,” O’Leary recalled.
Look, we try to remain neutral, but if that doesn't earn Timothée an Oscar, we'll demand a recount.
Or maybe we'll petition for a new category altogether: "Best Performance by a Derrière in a Drama."
