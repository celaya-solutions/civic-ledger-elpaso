Former Las Cruces police officer to be sentenced in January
LAS CRUCES, N.M. (KFOX14/CBS4) — Former Las Cruces Police officer Felipe Hernandez, who was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter for the 2023 deadly shooting of a woman, is expected to be sentenced in late January, according to court records.
According to court records obtained by KFOX14/CBS4, Hernandez has a sentencing hearing scheduled for Jan. 28 with Judge Richard Jacquez presiding as he faces up to 11 years in prison for voluntary manslaughter.
Hernandez's scheduled sentencing comes after he was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and not guilty of a second-degree murder charge following a four-day trial in October, following the 2023 shooting death of 45-year-old Teresa “Terry” Gomez.
Hernandez was initially charged with second-degree murder in the death of Gomez, who was shot and killed on Oct. 3, 2023.
In the early morning hours on Oct. 3, 2023, Hernandez stopped Gomez, along with a passenger in her vehicle, near the 1300 block of Burley Court.
In a body cam video, obtained by KFOX14/CBS4, Hernandez, an 8-year veteran officer, shot at least three times at Gomez while she was trying to run away.
Following the incident, the Las Cruces Police Department found probable cause to charge Hernandez.
A criminal complaint was filed against him on Jan. 9, 2024.
The City of Las Cruces stated that the severity of the actions warranted charges against Hernandez.
"The DA office came to that determination after reviewing all the evidence submitted by the officer-involved shooting task force," Doña Ana County District Attorney Gerald Byers previously said. “From the very beginning of Mr. Hernandez’s interaction with Ms. Gomez, the ability to manage protocol is non-existent. His interactions with her, just on a human level, was exceptionally subpar and did not meet the standards that LCPD demands of its officers."
Hernandez was arrested in January 2024 and charged with a felony count of second-degree murder.
He was relieved of his duties in May 2024 and no longer works for the city.
What Happened?
Before the shooting happened, Hernandez asked Gomez to step out of the car so he could ask her questions, which at first she denied before complying.
Gomez told Hernandez she was at a public housing after hours, visiting a friend named Butterfly. Hernandez then explained that she was trespassing, noting that the passenger in the car was also a frequent trespasser in the area.
As the video goes on, Gomez asks if she can sit back down in the car.
Hernandez, who was writing down the information, said yes, but instead Gomez started the car and tried to drive away.
The officer shot three rounds.
Gomez was taken to an area hospital, where she died.
