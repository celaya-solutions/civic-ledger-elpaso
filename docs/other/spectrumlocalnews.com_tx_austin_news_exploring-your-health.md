Most of us don't think about our health until something goes wrong. It's time to change that. In "Exploring Your Health," veteran reporter Erin Billups shows us that the small decisions we make every day can have a massive impact on the quality of our lives. Join Erin as she breaks down the complex science, issues and policies behind some of the most important health questions and what we can do about them.
Erin Billups spent her career covering some of the biggest issues in health as well as politics. Her new mission: giving communities a deeper understanding and empowering them to make better decisions about their health.
