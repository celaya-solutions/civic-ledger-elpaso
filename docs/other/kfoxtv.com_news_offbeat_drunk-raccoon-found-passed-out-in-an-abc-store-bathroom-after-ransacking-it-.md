Drunk raccoon found passed out in Virginia store bathroom after ransacking it: officials
ASHLAND, Va. (WSET) — An unexpected suspect was found passed out in the bathroom after ransacking an ABC Store in Virginia, according to officials.
In a social media post, the Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter said Officer Samantha Martin was dispatched to the Ashland ABC Store for a "very unusual call" early Saturday morning.
When Martin arrived, she found signs of a break-in: the shelves had been ransacked, and bottles were scattered all over the floor.
Who was the suspect?
A drunkenly passed-out raccoon, which was found in the store bathroom.

Martin then took the suspect back to the shelter to "sober up before questioning." After a few hours of sleeping off the night before, the raccoon was cleared with no injuries.
He was safely released back to the wild, hopefully having learned that breaking and entering is not the answer," the Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter said in the post.
