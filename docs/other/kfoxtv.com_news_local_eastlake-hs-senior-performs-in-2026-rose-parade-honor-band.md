Eastlake HS senior performs in 2026 Rose Parade Honor Band
EL PASO, TEXAS (KFOX14/CBS4) — An Eastlake High School student proudly represented the Borderland on Thursday when he marched in the Honor Band at the 2026 Rose Parade in Pasadena, California.
Ian Ortega-Huerta, a senior from Eastlake High School, not only represented El Paso but the state of Texas as he is the only tenor saxophone player in the state who performed.
For millions, the Rose Parade remains an iconic New Year's Day tradition. The parade, in California, travels five and a half miles and features floral-covered floats, equestrian units, marching bands, and Tournament Entries.
Speaking to KFOX14/CBS4, Ortega-Huerta, who has played tenor saxophone for six years, said he was honored to be asked to play in this year's Rose Parade.
"It was an honor to get that email and for someone to look at my application and say, 'oh we want him in that band,' it's just an honor."
He added that it was important for him to represent Eastlake, stating, "It means the whole world to me, I'm really glad to represent my school. It's awesome to see our name among all the students, and you just see my name say Eastlake High School. And to represent El Paso, too, is such an honor."
