Elderly man's note for help in mailbox leads to caregiver's arrest in Lantana
LANTANA, Fla. (CBS12) — A Lantana caregiver is facing criminal charges. Police say she tried to strangle an 81 year old man.
Denise Williams, 60, lives with him and is paid to look after him.
The way the man tried to reach out for help from the police is very unusual.
According to the arrest report, Williams was upset with the condition of the bathroom and she and the victim began to argue on Sunday, December 28.
Williams allegedly jumped on top of the man, who was in his bed, and she grabbed his throat with both hands and attempted to strangle him.
"She got on me, on top of me, started grabbing my hand that had the cell phone that I was calling the police, and I couldn't call the police because she grabbed it," he said. "Did you think she was trying to kill you?" we asked him. "No, no. She was just angry," he said.

Lantana Police say Williams then took away his car keys, his cell phone, disconnected two landline phones he had and locked them in her bedroom and she allegedly stole his credit card and checkbook and she left the house.
The victim was unable to call police because he did not have any of his phones.
He wrote a note which read: "Call the Police" and left it hanging on his mailbox next to his front door.
The next day on Monday, December 29 a letter carrier found the note, discussed what to do with his supervisor, and then they called Lantana Police and Williams was arrested.
"What do you think of the fact that he actually acted on this note, that he saw it and realized somebody needs help?" we asked the victim. "I'm very, very happy for that," he said.
The victim, who asked that we not use his name, says Williams did not write and cash any checks and did not use his credit card to make any purchases as far as he knows. The victim is a Navy veteran, a widower and a retired security guard.
Williams is charged with robbery by sudden snatching, battery on an elderly person, elderly exploitation and tampering with a victim.
He says until she attacked him, Williams had been his live-in caretaker for about two-and-a half years and he paid her $2,000 a month.
She is believed to be in a local hospital and when she's released, she will be transferred to the Palm Beach County Jail.
She has a court date January 29.
"I'm sorry for her. I really am, because she has no place to go right now, other than where she's going after she gets out of the hospital," the victim explained.
The mail carrier, who said his first name is David but would not give his last name, declined comment.
