One item TSA says to avoid wearing during holiday travel
(TNND) — Traveling during the holidays can be frustrating, especially with all the hoops the Transportation Security Administration makes people jump through, but they are offering one tip to make it easier.
The TSA advised festive travelers not to wear a certain type of clothing to the airport - sparkles.
“TSA PSA: The body scanners don’t love sparkles. We don’t want to dull your holiday shine, but we don’t recommend wearing your sparkly holiday sweater to the airport,” the agency wrote in a social media post on Dec. 18.
Travelers should also be aware that any sweaters that are defined as "light outer garments or bulky clothing" will have to be removed during the screening process. Items may include windbreakers, vests, light jackets, pullover hoodies, large sweaters, cardigans and ponchos.
“To help TSA officers get a clear look at your bag and reduce the need for additional screening, we suggest you pack your bag in neat layers,” according to the TSA.
Items that may be included in carry-on bags or in checked baggage include:
- Bobby pins
- Body armor
- Boxing gloves
- Hand warmers
- Handcuffs
- Headphones
- Heated jackets/sweaters
- Helmets
- Jewelry
- Life vest
- Night vision goggles
- Shock collars
- Shoe inserts
- Skates (including ice skates and rollerblades)
- Sports cleats
- Steel-toe boots
- Wallet chains
