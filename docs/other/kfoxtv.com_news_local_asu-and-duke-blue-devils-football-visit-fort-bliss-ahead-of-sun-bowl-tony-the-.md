ASU and Duke visit Fort Bliss ahead of Sun Bowl
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14, CBS4) — As Arizona State and Duke prepare to clash in the Sun Bowl on New Year's Eve, each team has taken trips around El Paso to experience the culture of the Sun City.
On Monday, both teams took a trip up to Fort Bliss.
This is an annual tradition for the participating teams of the Sun Bowl.
"It is cool to see what the military goes through," ASU offensive lineman Ian Shewell said.
"We would have never gotten this opportunity in our lifetimes," Duke tight end Landon King said. "We are really just trying to take advantage of it."
The teams got the opportunity to meet troops, check out military equipment and try out the tank simulators.
"The transition from Call of Duty to real life is really not the same," ASU running back Kyson Brown said.
