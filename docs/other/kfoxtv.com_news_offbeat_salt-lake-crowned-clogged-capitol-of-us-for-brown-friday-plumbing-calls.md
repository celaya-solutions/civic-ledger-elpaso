Salt Lake crowned 'Clogged Capitol' of US for 'Brown Friday' plumbing calls
SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) — We hear all about Black Friday, but did you know it’s also called “Brown Friday?” It can become a major a plumbing headache.
That label is because the day after the big turkey dinner is also the busiest plumbing day of the year, and Salt Lake City was just crowned by Yelp as the “Clogged Capital” of the United States.

Salt Lake Community College master plumber Tyler Clark talked to ARC Salt Lake about avoid unwanted plumbing problems.
He said the biggest plumbing problem after Thanksgiving is what they call FOG – or fats, oils and grease.
“When you’re cooking that turkey, you’re pouring the turkey grease down the drain – just because it’s called a garbage disposal does not actually mean it’s a garbage can,” Clark said.
He said putting the fat and grease down the sink will cause problems.
“You’re drains are meant for liquids, right – and something that’s not meant to be solid,” he said. “Your toilets are what’s meant for your solids.”
Clark said you should avoid putting down the sink anything that can be scraped off into a garbage can.
“The big thing that clogs up your drains on Thanksgiving would be your potato peals – number one thing that clogs your sink,” Clark said. “It turns into a big mess, clogs up your drain, and then your sink.”
If those peels do end up down the drain and into your main pipes, you’ll have to call out a plumber.
Clark gave several tips to solve the problem on your own – or to avoid it altogether.
“When you start noticing (water) backup (in the sink), stop what you’re doing, try and run the disposal, and get it down as far as you can. Then if it runs, you’re good to go,” he said.
He said you can put a bag inside the sink – or a strainer - and peel the potatoes into that. Then throw them into the trash.
Turkey brine dumped down the sink can also lead to problems once it sets.
“Make sure you soak up as much of you can, dump it in a Mason jar or anything you have that will give you a way to dispose of it later in the trash can,” Clark said.
He said the best advice he could give is to dump leftover food from your plate into the garbage.
“Just remember,” he said. “The disposal is not a garbage can.”
