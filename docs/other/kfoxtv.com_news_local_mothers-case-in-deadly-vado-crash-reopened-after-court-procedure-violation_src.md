Vado crash case reopens as mother pleads not guilty to charges in deadly DUI incident
VADO, N.M. (KFOX14/CBS4) — The case against a mother involved in the deadly crash in Vado, New Mexico, was reopened in November.
The case was reopened on Nov. 4 after it was dismissed without prejudice due to a violation of court procedure, according to court documents.
Christina Escobedo Arriaga was arraigned on Nov. 17 and entered a not guilty plea.
According to the documents, the case was dismissed in October due to the release of her first appearance. It appears that the order of her conditions of release was amended and signed by the arraigning judge, but not the defendant. It also stated that her address in the document had a missing space or unit number.
The New Mexico State Police had previously reported that Arriaga was arrested after allegedly driving drunk and crashing a 2007 purple Dodge Charger in August, resulting in the deaths of a 15-year-old and a 12-year-old, including her own daughter.
New Mexico State Police officials also confirmed that the 12-year-old was the daughter of Escobedo Arriaga.
Another 15-year-old was injured but survived.
The crash happened at around 6:50 p.m. in the area of 8100 Highway 478.
NMSP said the Dodge Charger flew off the roadway, hit a light pole, a chain-link fence, and a tree before coming to a crashing stop on the front yard of a home.
Home surveillance video appears to have caught the moments before the tragic crash.

NMPS said the two kids were pronounced dead on the scene by the Office of the Medical Investigator, while Arriaga and a second 15-year-old passenger were taken to the hospital.
Investigators said the contributing factors in the crash and the deaths were alcohol and improper seatbelt use, adding that the surviving 15-year-old appeared to have been using his seatbelt properly.
Arriaga was originally charged with:
- Two counts of Homicide by Vehicle (Driving While Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor or Any Drug)
- One count of Great Bodily Harm by Vehicle (Driving While Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor or Any Drug)
- Two counts of Intentional Abuse of a Child Resulting in Death
- One count of Abuse of a Child Resulting in Great Bodily Harm
- One count of Driving While Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor
