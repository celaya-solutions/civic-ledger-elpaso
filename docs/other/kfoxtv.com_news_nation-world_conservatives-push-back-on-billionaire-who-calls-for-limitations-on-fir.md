Conservatives push back on Israeli billionaire calling for limitations on First Amendment
WASHINGTON (TNND) — Conservatives on the social media platform X have been pushing back on Israeli investor Shlomo Kramer who went viral during a CNBC interview for saying there has to be limitations on the First Amendment.
During a conversation about artificial intelligence and cyber warfare, Kramer advocated for the government getting involved more to stop misinformation.
“I know it’s difficult to hear, but it’s time to limit the First Amendment and protect it, and quickly before it’s too late,” Kramer said during the interview.
One of the hosts asked Kramer to clarify what he meant.
“I mean that we need to control the platformsall the social platforms,” he responded.
“We need to stack rank the authenticity of every person that expresses themselves online and take control over what they are saying based on that ranking.”
He later clarified that it should be the government that should be doing this.
The clip of the interview went viral, resulting in conservative individuals reacting to it.
Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee retweeted the video and just captioned it, “No.”
Florida GOP gubernatorial candidate James Fishback weighed in on the interview.
“Not on my watch,” he said.
“I will *always* defend the First Amendment as Florida Governor.”
Former Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz pushed back on Kramer saying, “No. We aren’t going to do this.”
Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene also weighed in.
"An Israeli cybersecurity billionaire demanding to take away Americans guaranteed First Amendment Free Speech and President Trump threatening war and sending in troops to Iran is everything we voted against in ‘24,'" Greene wrote on the social media platform, X.
