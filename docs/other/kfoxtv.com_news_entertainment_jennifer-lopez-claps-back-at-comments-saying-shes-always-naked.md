Jennifer Lopez responds after commenters say she’s 'always naked'
Jennifer Lopez isn’t letting any haters get to her.
At the opening night of her Las Vegas residency, “Up All Night: Live in Las Vegas,” she joked about people criticizing her fashion and style.
“It is funny, I do laugh at some of the things sometimes, but they do say funny things, too,” she told the sold-out audience at Caeser’s Palace Tuesday night in a video captured by a fan.
“One of the things is, ‘Why when she does pictures does she always smile with her mouth open?'” she said with a laugh, imitating one of her signature red carpet poses.
She continued, “‘Why she always do that? Why she smile when she takes pictures like that? Why does she always dress that way? Why don’t she dress her age?’ I was like, ‘Huh?'”
“'Why is she always naked?’” she joked, laughing before shouting to the crowd, “And I say if you had this booty you’d be naked too!”
Lopez was in a playful mood during her concert, addressing her past marriages during another break in the show.
While reflecting on her first Las Vegas residency that ran from 2016 to 2018, Lopez said, “That went by in a blink didn’t it? For those of you who were there on opening night 10 years ago. At that time, I had only been married twice.”
“That’s not true. It was only once. Felt like twice,” she added with a laugh. “I’m just kidding.”
Not to question an icon, but she had actually been married a few times by that point: to Ojani Noa from 1997 to 1998, Cris Judd from 2001 to 2003 and Marc Anthony from 2004 to 2014.
The “Kiss of the Spider Woman” star told the crowd, “It’s over and we just, boom, and it’s fine. It’s all good. The good news is that I’m learning and I’m growing. We’re in our happy era right now.”
It seems like Lopez’s happy era is focusing on work. A source recently told People she’s not looking to date following her divorce from Ben Affleck, saying, “It's all about work and the kids for her. She seems happy and content."
