Baby nicknamed 'Little Buc-ee' after woman gives birth in gas station parking lot
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (WKRC) — A baby girl was nicknamed "Little Buc-ee" after her mother gave birth to her in a gas station parking lot.
Nathan and Jena Birdsong were headed to the hospital in Missouri in the middle of the night on November 14 -- but they only made it as far as Buc-ee's when they were forced to pull over.
So, they a makeshift delivery room in an unexpected place -- the parking lot.
"I pulled in there, parked the truck, hopped out, got on her side, was trying to look, see if any emergency services were on the way, on the phone with 911, still with a representative from Mercy talking to me about how to deliver the baby," Nathan said.
"I delivered her at 3:16 a.m., and by 3:17 a.m., that’s when I saw the Strafford Police Department start coming in the parking lot," he added.
Luckily, the delivery was successful and Jena and Elaina made it out of the ordeal in perfect health.
The couple, who has two other children, named their daughter, Elaina Grace Birdsong.
But she also has a nickname -- “Little Buc-ee.”
“Over the holidays, everyone kept saying, ‘Here’s Little Buc-ee. One of them got her a ‘Little Buc-ee’ Christmas ornament already," Jena told KOLR.
“We don’t go to Buc-ee’s often, but we do love getting gas there,” the parents told the media outlet. “It’s going to be a great story.”
