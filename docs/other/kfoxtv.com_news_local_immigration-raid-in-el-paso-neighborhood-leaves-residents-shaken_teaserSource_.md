Immigration raid in El Paso neighborhood leaves residents shaken
El Paso, TX (KFOX14/CBS4) — An apparent immigration raid in Far East El Paso has left residents rattled after witnessing what they described as a chaotic scene involving unmarked ICE vehicles and the apprehension of workers building homes.
Christian Garcia, a local resident, recounted the event, saying, "I saw an unmarked vehicle parked, like, two houses down."
Garcia described authorities descending on workers off Bob Hope Drive, noting, "He creeped up on the workers. And he already had one guy detained, and he had them by the by his hands, and he already had them by his back, and he wasn't letting them go."
Garcia shared footage and photos of the arrests, which included the use of a helicopter, as some men reportedly fled the site.
"There was a bunch of, like, people in military vests and they were identifiable, the officers themselves, it's just the cars they pulled up and it was like normal cars you see every day," Garcia said. "And they pulled up and they just started harassing these people."
An anonymous neighbor expressed shock and devastation, stating, "These are our community workers. They help build our schools, our houses, and they ensure safety of our houses. And especially for this to happen on New Year's Eve, it's it's just devastating. They're hard working people. Honestly, most of them do not have criminal records."
Alan Surratt, another resident, shared mixed feelings about the incident.
"You know, I don't know. I have mixed feelings about it, to be honest. I mean, these guys are working. I don't think they're criminals, but you never know," he said.
KFOX14 reached out to ICE and DHS for comment or details surrounding the event, but the agencies have not responded in time for this report.
Garcia expressed his frustration, saying, "It's unreal. Something real I can't put into words. Still, now I'm shaking a little bit, like it's all coming back to me. What I experienced and I don't know, it's an injustice."
