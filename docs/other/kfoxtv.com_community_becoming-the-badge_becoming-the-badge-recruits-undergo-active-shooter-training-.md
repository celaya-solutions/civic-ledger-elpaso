'Becoming the Badge' recruits undergo active shooter training as graduation nears
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — This week on 'Becoming the Badge' the 16 recruits left standing in the 133rd El Paso Police Academy are faced with active shooter training. The academy has them using a vacant school for realistic purposes.
This training is being taken very seriously because in just one week, on March 15, the recruits will graduate.
This means, that once they have that badge on their chest, if an active shooter situation were to happen and they were first on the scene, whether they've been in the department a month or 20 years, they will need to be ready to go in and stop the threat.
