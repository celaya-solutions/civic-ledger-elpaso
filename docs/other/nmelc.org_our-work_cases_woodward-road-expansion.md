SUMMARY:
Assist clients with the National Environmental Protection Act process of the Sunport highway expansion before the NM Department of Transportation. The clients’ goal is to prevent the construction of Sunport Boulevard through the San Jose neighborhood. The project would potentially run from the Sunport exit off I-25 west to the Bosque and Rio Grande. The County is forced to begin NEPA review again. We are waiting for the results from the Federal Highway Administration.
