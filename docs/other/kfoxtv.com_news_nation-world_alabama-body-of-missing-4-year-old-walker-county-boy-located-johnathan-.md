Body of missing 4-year-old Walker County boy located
WALKER COUNTY, Ala. (WBMA) — The body of a missing 4-year-old Walker County boy was located.
During a news conference Friday afternoon, Walker County Sheriff Nick Smith said the body of Johnathan Everett Boley was discovered about two miles from his home.
"Johnathan was an adventurous boy and he loved the outdoors," said Smith.
Smith said the dog Boley was believed to have been with was alive and still with him when he was discovered.
Authorities said Boley was last seen on December 31 around 11:30 a.m. in the 7000 block of Highway 195 in Jasper.
Volunteers and authorities spent the last couple of days searching for Boley. Smith announced the child's father had been arrested in connection with the investigation after explosives were located at his residence.
"This is gonna be a very hard time for our community. It's gonna be a very hard time for the volunteer team that did an outstanding job to find Johnathan," said Smith. " This is not the outcome we wanted to see. We were hopeful for a positive outcome."
