Tennessee farm swaps Thanksgiving tradition for turkey snuggles
CHRISTIANA, Tenn. (WTVC) — As the holiday rush kicks in, some people are choosing a different kind of Thanksgiving warm-up. Instead of carving turkeys, visitors at one Tennessee farm are cuddling them.
The Gentle Barn is an animal rescue and therapy farm where guests can brush cows, scratch sheep and, yes, hold turkeys. On a recent visit, Middle Tennessee State University student Jordan Gullotta cradled a blind turkey named Smudge until the bird relaxed and drifted off in her arms.
Founder Ellie Laks said turkey time is intentional. She believes the birds deserve the same therapeutic spotlight as dogs, cats and horses.
Why not turkeys?” Laks said.
The idea started years ago when a talkative turkey followed her around the farm during chores. When she sat down and opened her arms, the bird hopped right in.
The 60 animals at the Tennessee farm were rescued from abuse or neglect. Some need special care, including a turkey that gets acupuncture for hip pain and a goat that moves around in a custom wheelchair after losing its back hooves to hypothermia.
We rehabilitate them and give them sanctuary,” Laks said. “When they’re ready, we partner with them to help people heal from their own trauma.”
Laks said turkeys are often mislabeled as dull or unfriendly, but she has found them to be smart, gentle and surprisingly affectionate.
Gullotta said she usually visits for the cows, but holding a turkey gave her a new appreciation.
They have their own way of loving,” she said.
Turkey therapy sessions run all year. The Gentle Barn is also offering a special Thanksgiving visit where people can feed and pet the birds. Guests can sponsor a rescued turkey to help cover its care.
