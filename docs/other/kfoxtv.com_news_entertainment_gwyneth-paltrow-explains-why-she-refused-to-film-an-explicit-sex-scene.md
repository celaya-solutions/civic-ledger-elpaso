Gwyneth Paltrow explains why she refused to film an explicit sex scene with THIS star
Gwyneth Paltrow has had her share of sex scenes, including in her latest film “Marty Supreme,” but there was one she absolutely refused to do.
Paltrow starred in 1998’s “Great Expectations” alongside Ethan Hawke, and they recently reunited for a Vanity Fair interview about making the film.
Hawke asked, "Do you remember Alfonso pitching you the love scene?" to which Paltrow replied, “Oh, my God!”
The scene would have included her character, Estrella, receiving oral sex from Hawke’s character, Finnegan Bell.
"I was like, 'Oh, my God, my father’s going to have a heart attack,'" she recalled of the scene, which was ultimately cut from filming.
Hawke reenacted director Alfonso Cuarón describing the scene, saying, "'The camera is going to go down your belly, and then it's going to go up your breasts, and then it's going to go in your face as you reach ecstasy. And then when you reach ecstasy, the light will explode like to the sun!'"
As Paltrow laughed, Hawke added, "I remember looking at Gwyneth, and Gwyneth is like, 'Alfonso...I'm never going to do that.'"
Paltrow explained her hesitancy about the scene, "In my early career, I was really self-conscious about my dad and grandfather seeing this kind of stuff," the Oscar-winner said. "Like it really bothered me. Now, I wouldn’t care."
Hawke offered his support of Paltrow’s stance, saying, "I think in regard to that scene, you had an awareness of the way that the business works, and the ways in which those kinds of images could be manipulated and what it meant to your dad. And you were amazing, the way you handled that."
Paltrow doesn’t worry about sex scenes as much now, but admitted it was “not great” when her 19-year-old son, Moses, saw her steamy scene in “Marty Supreme.”
On “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” Paltrow said Moses covered his eyes “the whole time. Yeah, not into that.”
