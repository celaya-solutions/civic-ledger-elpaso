El Paso native Robert Arevalo blends martial arts and filmmaking in Hollywood career
El Paso, TX (KFOX14/CBS4) — Robert Arevalo, an El Paso native, has carved a unique path in the entertainment industry, blending his skills in martial arts, acting, and filmmaking.
Arevalo, who attended St. Joseph’s Catholic School and graduated from Hanks High School, moved to Los Angeles at 18. There, he trained in Jeet Kune Do and Filipino Kali under Bruce Lee’s protégés and earned a second-degree black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu from the Machado brothers (cousins of the Gracie's).
Arevalo's journey into screenplay writing was inspired by an encounter with Sylvester Stallone. "I used to work at a bar in Beverly Hills, and Stallone used to come in there all the time," Arevalo said. "One day I followed him out and I said, 'Hey, do you mind if I talk to you for a second?'... I said, 'I would love to be a legend like you.' He kind of laughed and said, 'I wrote Rocky for the way I walked and the way I talked.
Nobody wanted to hire me in this town... So what you need to do is learn how to write, create your own opportunities.'"
In addition to his acting and filmmaking pursuits, Arevalo has trained Hollywood stars like Keanu Reeves for "John Wick" and Jason Momoa for "Aquaman." He is also a certified bounty hunter and serves as a tribal chairman for a band of Apaches.
Arevalo's latest role is in the series "Tulsa King," where he plays a tribal police officer in the episode "The Art of War."
The show, featuring Sylvester Stallone, is available on Paramount Plus. Arevalo continues to work on scripts for future films he plans to direct, showcasing his diverse talents and passion for storytelling.
