Officers at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago intercepted disturbing cargo from a passenger's suitcase, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB).
The freakish discoveries were found as the passenger was traveling to the U.S. from Africa.
Among the items were four pounds of "nonhuman primate meat," as well as 11 pounds of beans infested by pests.
"A passenger from Congo believed the food they were bringing was fine; it was not," the CPB noted in a post shared on X.
"In the passenger’s suitcase O’Hare Agriculture Specialists found 11lbs of beans w/ pests, 17lbs of unknown plants, & 4lbs of nonhuman primate meat," according to the post.
The CBP's post included images of a dead primate, which appeared to be a small monkey.
The CBP said the items are all prohibited, adding that they were seized destroyed.
