What Influences You: ARC El Paso Paints with Regions only Bob Ross Certified Instructor
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — El Paso, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) - Shawn Warswick, the only Bob Ross-certified instructor in the borderlands, is bringing the joy of painting to El Paso.
Warswick, who conducts weekend classes, completed a rigorous three-week training program in Florida, where he learned the Bob Ross technique from those trained by Ross himself.
"It's not just hey, we're gonna paint like Bob Ross," Warswick explained.
Despite not having taken an art class in years, Warswick was inspired by Ross's encouragement.
"Bob always said you can do this," he recalled. Initially, his attempts were unsuccessful, but perseverance paid off.
"It's not about the money. It's just what it does for you internally," he said, reflecting on the confidence painting has instilled in him.
Warswick's classes, held monthly in El Paso, offer participants the chance to create their own "happy little mountains" and more.
