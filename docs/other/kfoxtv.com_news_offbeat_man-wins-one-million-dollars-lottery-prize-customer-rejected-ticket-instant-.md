Man wins $1M lottery prize after another customer rejected the ticket
WAYNE COUNTY, Mich. (WKRC) - A man struck it rich after buying an instant game ticket that another customer had left behind.
The 33-year-old winner, who chose to remain anonymous, claimed the Blazing Suits $1 million top prize, according to Michigan Lottery.
“There was a Blazing Suits ticket set aside on the counter that someone else had decided not to purchase, so I purchased it,” he said. “I scratched the ticket off and couldn’t believe it when I saw it was a $1 million winner. I never would have thought I’d win such a large lottery prize, so it’s truly a blessing.”
The winning ticket was purchased at Fawaz Petroleum LLC, 19245 Schoolcraft in Detroit.
The winner opted for a one-time lump-sum payment of about $693,000 instead of annuity payments.
He plans to save his winnings, acknowledging the pressure that comes with such a windfall.
“Winning is a great feeling, but it’s also a lot of pressure because your mind starts thinking of all the different things you can do with this amount of money,” he said.
