But we want you to enjoy this festive time of year.
So, grab your hot chocolate and feast your eyes on these hilarious holiday memes.
'Can't be beat'
This one has us snickering. And we love the captions. It's a wrap!

Who would win in a UFC match?
Our vote is on Santa Claus. He looks pretty jacked.
Naughty, not nice!
This Elf on the Shelf looks like he's putting a hurting on the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man! Ouch!
Want some lemonade?
We think we're going pass on that one. But thanks!
Is Die Hard a Christmas movie?
It's a debate we've all heard before -- and one that seems to continue every year. What do you think?
Litter's full!
Speaking of Christmas movies, if you're a fan of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, you'll understand this witty meme. (Click on the pic!)
Who has it worse?
Sorry, Christmas stocking. We think the pinata has you "beat" on this one.
You can't take the day off.
Working on Christmas is mandatory for holiday lights -- but we will cut some slack for the flickering lights who work "on and off."
The kids helped
A little harsh, but also a little hilarious.
Grandma got run over by a reindeer.
You have that song stuck in your head now, don't you?
