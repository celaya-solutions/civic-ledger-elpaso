Firefighters rescue German Shepherd trapped under car on Christmas Eve
Christmas Eve quickly became a rescue mission when a German Shepherd dog was found trapped under a vehicle in Tucson, Arizona.
The Tucson Fire Department was on the scene to help set the trapped dog free, according to CNN. They were nearby, helping put out a car fire. The dog jumped in front of a vehicle and got its paw stuck under the back tire, although the driver slammed on the brakes.
Rescuers were able to save the dog and hand it over safely to animal control.
“The dog was scared and trembling but appeared to be OK,” the TFD said in a news release, according to local outlet KOLD. “The crew placed the car in neutral and carefully rolled it forward enough to free the pup, who was then turned over to an animal control officer.”
“We’re glad this Christmas Eve call ended with everyone, humans and pups, safe,” they added.
To do so, they blocked traffic on a wet roadway, according to the local station, KVOA. They added that it marks the second time in two weeks that crews have rescued a dog.
