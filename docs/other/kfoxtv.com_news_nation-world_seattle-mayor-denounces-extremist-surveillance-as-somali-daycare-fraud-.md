Seattle Mayor defends Somalis; Ignores the topic of fraud in social media statement
WASHINGTON (TNND) — Just a day before being officially sworn in as mayor of Seattle, Katie Wilson issued a statement of solidarity with the Somalian community on X in response to recent allegations that members of the Somalian diaspora in Minnesota are running fraudulent day care centers.
A couple of weeks ago, Youtuber and self-described independent journalist Nick Shirley released a video which revealed that no children were present at several daycares, which received state funding in the Twin Cities, when he visited during typical hours of operations. The video received major traction, garnering the attention of the Trump administration.
The Department of Health and Human Services froze roughly $185 million in federal child care funding. Although, no formal charges or incidents of fraud have been uncovered in connection to Shirley’s video.
The video also comes after members of the Somali community were accused of defrauding social welfare programs, including an estimated half of $18 billion of Minnesota’s Medicaid payments. At least 85 of the 98 individuals charged in the slew of Minnesota welfare corruption scandal are of Somali descent.
But, Wilson, a far-left progressive, makes no mention of the connection between numerous members of the Somalian community and the widespread fraud across Minnesota’s welfare programs when she makes her statement addressing the “harassment of Somali Childcare providers,” likely referencing Shirley’s viral video.
“I stand with the Somali childcare providers who have experienced targeted harassment, and condemn the surveillance campaign promoted by extremist influencers,” Wilson wrote on an X sharing her official statement.
WIlson also included a link to the Washington Attorney General’s office for individuals to report hate crimes.
In light of the recent fraud scandals, the Somalian community has been under heightened scrutiny.
President Donald Trump has called migrants from the African country “garbage” and his administration is taking serious steps to revoke the citizenship status of those involved in the fraudulent activity.
