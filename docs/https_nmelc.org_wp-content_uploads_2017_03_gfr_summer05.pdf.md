V II CC TT OO RR II EE SS
SPRING AND SUMMER 2005 YIELDED SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS for several
of the communities with which the Law Center works, including
the three extremely important victories below. These and other
triumphs not only have tremendous impact for the communities
that achieved them, but also statewide and national implications
for environmental justice and environmental protection.
See  inside  for  details.
1. Picuris Pueblo regains sacred lands
For more than forty years, the Picuris People watched as industrial mica
mines destroyed lands sacred to the tribe. In April, 2005, the Pueblo
regained the land and is now working with the Law Center to heal the
site and restore ancient land-based traditions.
2. Navajo Nation bans uranium mining
The Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM), the
Southwest Research and Information Center (SRIC) and the Law Center
succeeded in educating Navajo lawmakers, who passed a ban on all
uranium mining and processing in Navajo Indian Country. This is
the first tribal law in the country outlawing uranium mining.
3. NM Supreme Court rules in favor 
of community input
Although the New Mexico Environment Department was mandated by
the NM Solid Waste Act to hold public hearings before issuing landfill
permits, the agency relied completely on technical evidence and disre-
garded public tetimony on quality-of-life issues. The Supreme Court
decision affirms that community concerns must be considered
during the permitting process.

Working with the Navajo Nation Office of Legislative Counsel and our clients, the
Southwest Research and Information Center (SRIC) and the Eastern Navajo Diné Against
Uranium Mining (ENDAUM), the Law Center drafted legislation for consideration by the
Navajo Nation Tribal Council. This legislation bans conventional uranium mining, such
as shaft and pit mines, and places a moratorium on uranium processing, which
includes ISL mining, in order to protect the Navajo Nation’s water resources. The
distinction between conventional uranium mining and processing was made to conform to
federal jurisprudence interpreting the authority of states (and by analogy tribes) to regulate
nuclear materials under the Atomic Energy Act. The DNRPA also imposes civil penalties
on any person violating the terms of the Act, and invokes Navajo traditional law to protect
the Nation’s water resources.

Despite the ban, the struggle to keep the groundwater pristine in Crownpoint and Church
Rock continues. On March 4, ENDAUM and SRIC filed a 1,200 page presentation on
groundwater issues, where we again presented compelling technical testimony that HRI’s
ISL mining operations would substantially endanger Crownpoint and Church Rock's
underground drinking water sources.
On June 4, we filed a brief on radioactive air emissions on behalf of ENDAUM and SRIC.
In that brief, we argued that radioactive air emissions from HRI’s ISL operation on Church
Rock Section 17 would impermissibly add to existing radioactive contamination in Church
Rock from past uranium mining. Rather than cleaning up existing radioactive contami-
nation, the NRC is permitting an entirely new operation that will further irradiate
Church Rock's residents.
Finally, on June 28, we filed a brief on issues relating to the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA). We argued a number of issues in that brief, but in particular we emphasized
that the Final Environmental Impact Statement’s (FEIS) justification for the purpose and
the need for the HRI project was inadequate. In the FEIS, the NRC concluded that the
purpose and need in generating the FEIS was to issue a materials license to HRI. Under
NEPA, this statement of purpose and need is clearly inadequate.

In addition to needing its materials license
from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) to conduct mining, Hydro Resources.
Inc. (HRI) also needs two different permits
required by the Safe Drinking Water Act
(SDWA) before it can begin mining. Before
the permits can be issued for its Church
Rock Section 8 mine, however, there must be
a determination about whether New Mexico
or the federal government and the Navajo
Nation have jurisdiction to issue the permits.
On March 3, the New Mexico Secretary of
the Environment, Ron Curry, sent a letter to
the U.S. EPA asking it to make a determina-
tion about whether HRI’s Section 8 mine site
was “Indian Country.” If Section 8 is deter-
mined to be Indian Country, the federal
government and the Navajo Nation will have
jurisdiction under the SDWA. If it is not,
then New Mexico will be able to issue
permits under the SDWA. In the letter, Mr.
Curry took the position that the State has the
authority to issue permits to HRI. The letter
was copied to HRI, but not to the Law
Center’s clients.

Which sovereign has jurisdiction to issue
HRI permits pursuant to the SDWA is
critically important. If Section 8 is 
determined to be Indian Country, the Navajo
Nation’s ban on uranium mining and
processing will apply and HRI will be
prohibited from conducting operations. If
New Mexico is determined able to issue
SDWA permits, the uranium ban would not
apply. The U.S. EPA will be taking public
comments on this issue in the future, and the
Law Center’s clients will be submitting
comments advocating Indian Country status
for Section 8.

On July 20, the NRC administrative law judge presiding over the HRI
case issued a partial initial decision on the groundwater issue.
Unfortunately, he sided with HRI and the NRC Staff. In his decision,
Judge E. Roy Hawkens determined that HRI’s mining operations
would not threaten underground sources of drinking water adjacent to
its mine sites. In other words, Judge Hawkens concluded that HRI
could contain its highly toxic mining solution in a discreet area for the
duration of its operations. The Judge also concluded that HRI could
restore the groundwater to “average well field levels” (read “highly
contaminated”) and that the water would never migrate to nearby
underground sources of drinking water. In many instances, the Judge
refused to consider new evidence presented by ENDAUM and SRIC
in regards to the three remaining minesites, instead applying the deci-
sions that a former administrative law judge made when ruling on the
Section 8 minesite in 2004. ENDAUM and SRIC plan to appeal Judge
Hawken’s decision to the full Commission.

The citizens of Mesquite have been living next to the Helena
Chemical fertilizer plant since the mid-20th century. The chemical
plant has operated without a permit under the Air Quality Act since
the 1980’s. Some residents who live near the plant believe their chil-
dren have suffered eye irritation, sore throats, skin rashes, bloody
noses and breathing problems as a result of the plant’s operation.
Since March, the Law Center has been advising and consulting Arturo
Uribe and the citizens of Mesquite as they meet and bargain with
NMED on the issue of enforcement against Helena Chemical.
Recently, through the efforts of the Mesquite citizens and the Law
Center, NMED issued a compliance order against Helena
Chemical, fined the company nearly $250,000 and ordered it to
obtain an operating permit.
But is it enough?  Already, the company is refusing to pay the fines,
and bargaining for much less -- the company alleges it should pay only
$12,000, and that the calculation of damages against them was a 
violation of constitutional law. A hearing before the Environment
Department is likely the next step. The Law Center will be there 
representing the citizens of Mesquite.

Sitting in the Mining and Minerals Division (MMD) conference room,
Picuris Governor Richard Mermejo quietly ended forty years of
culutral devastation for the members of Picuris Pueblo with a few
strokes of his pen. On April 24th, the 
permit and the deed for the mine were transferred to the tribe as the
result of a settlement negotiation with
Oglebay Norton, the company that oper-
ated the U.S. Hill mica mine from 1999 to
2004. Oglebay Norton is now dropped
from the aboriginal title claim.
As the new owner of the mine site,
the Pueblo faces the challenge of
complying with the New Mexico
Mining Act and reclaiming the land in accor-
dance with state law and in accordance
with cultural needs. A revised closeout
plan has been submitted to the state
Mining and Minerals Division. The Pueblo is waiting for approval of
this plan before beginning reclamation and showing MMD and the
entire mining community in New Mexico how proper mining
reclamation should take place.
At the same time, the Law Center continues as co-counsel for the
aboriginal title claim against Franklin Minerals, the company that oper-
ated the mine prior to Oglebay Norton. If the Pueblo wins its case in
federal court, it could obtain monetary damages from Franklin
Minerals.

The continuing battle to protect the petroglyph escarpment on the
West Side of Albuquerque (which includes the Petroglyph National
Monument and the Las Imagines Archaelogical District) has been 
taking place on several fronts.
The City of Albuqurque applied to the Cultural Properties Review
Committee (CPRC) for an archaeological excavation permit to remove
a number of petroglyphs from the pathway of the proposed extension
of Paseo Del Norte. A number of parties including Picuris Pueblo
and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, represented by the
Law Center, argued against the granting of the permit based on

the fact that the City of Albuquerque’s attempts at tribal
consultation were inadequate. The City of Albuquerque sent
one-page letters to six apparently randomly selected Pueblos and
Tribes, although more than twenty indigenous nations have spiritual
and cultural connections with the petroglyph area. No attempts
were made to follow up on these letters with phone calls, additional
letters, or visits with tribal leaders.
Since July, tribal leaders have been meeting to decide the proper
format and conditions for tribal consultation with the City of
Albuquerque. The end result is that the extension of Paseo del
Norte has been delayed pending the approval of the CPRC that the
correct testing data has been collected and that tribal consultation
has been adequate.
Recently, three west side neighborhood associations were allowed to
intervene on the side of the City, against SAGE Council and other
plaintiffs that are fighting the extension of the roadway. The City of
Albuquerque has filed a motion for summary judgment against the
plaintiffs arguing that there are no questions of fact in the lawsuit,
and that the City should win automatically as a matter of law with-
out going to a jury. The motion for summary judgment was heard
in the district court in Albuquerque in late August; the Law Center
and its clients await a decision.

The Valle Vidal, near Cimarron, teems with life. In the winter, one
of the state’s largest elk herds winters in the low-lying vegas, while
in the summer the lush valley is home to horseback riders, hikers
and 3,000 Boy Scouts. The Coalition for the Valle Vidal, of which
the Law Center is a member, is working to protect the Valle as one
of New Mexico’s natural treasures. But El Paso Corp. and other
energy developers seek to turn the site into an industrial gas zone,
complete with hundreds of miles of pipelines and powerlines, noisy
compressor stations and hundreds of pumpjacks. Drilling in the
Valle Vidal could provide as little as eleven hours of our national
energy supply.
Because the Valle Vidal Unit has never been incorporated into the
Forest Management Plan for the Carson National Forest, the U.S.
Forest Service is now working to amend the plan to include the
Valle. As part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
process, the Forest Service initiated a public scoping process in June.
During this process, which ended on September 14th, the Forest
Service gave the public an opportunity to provide ideas for the
scope of issues and alternatives that should be evaluated in the
Draft Environmental Impact Statement.
This summer saw important strides for the Valle campaign. First,
Governor Richardson and the NM Dept. of Game and Fish nomi-
nated the creeks in the Valle Vidal for “Outstanding National
Resource Waters” status, which would protect them fromfuture
degradation. Second, Congressman Tom Udall (D-NM) announced 
that he is developing legislation to permanently protect the site,
while Representative Heather Wilson (R-NM) submitted comments
to the Forest Service stating that the Valle Vidal should be protected
from drilling. Third, the Coalition has recruited a diverse group of
spokespeople, including a former NM Oil and Gas Association pres-
ident, to advocate for the protection of the Valle Vidal. You can

Representing the Gila Resources Information Project (GRIP), we
won a unanimous decision before the New Mexico Court of
Appeals. The decision overturned a 2004 ruling by the Water
Quality Control Commission to dismiss GRIP’s appeal of the
closure/closeout plan for the Chino copper mine in Grant County.
Literally years in the making, the infamous Chino closure/closeout
plan was the product of a behind-the-scenes “secret deal” between
the Johnson administration and the Phelps Dodge Mining Company,
which owns the Chino mine in southern New Mexico. This plan
contained provisions such as the “open pit capture zone” in which
hundreds of tons of waste rock would not be reclaimed, and the
“cleaning up” of mine-contaminated water by simply diluting it with
thousands of acre-feet of potable water.
The Water Quality Control Commission refused to hear GRIP’s
appeal after Phelps Dodge filed a Motion to Dismiss based on tech-
nicalities. The Court of Appeals unanimously reversed, entitling
GRIP and the Law Center to now present its case before the
Commission to determine once and for all if this dirty deal is sound
and legal. In 2004, the Law Center and GRIP had a tremendous 
victory on the Tyrone closure/closeout plan before this same
commission on similar issues.

Recently, the New Mexico Supreme Court made a decision that
changes significantly the manner in which communities may participate
in NMED decision-making procedures concerning proposed solid
waste facilities such as landfills. The case involved a landfill, but the
Court’s ruling will apply to all solid waste facilities that operate
pursuant to permits issued by the NMED under the State Solid Waste
Act, and it may influence decision making under other laws as well.
The case that was decided in the Supreme Court began with a public
hearing in Chaparral in early September, 2001. The hearing was
conducted by the NMED pursuant to the State Solid Waste Act and
Solid Waste Management Regulations. They require that a public hear-
ing be conducted by the Department whenever it is evaluating whether
to issue a permit pursuant to the Act, and this hearing addressed
whether the Department should issue a permit to Rhino
Environmental Services, Inc. to construct and operate a municipal
waste landfill in Chaparral.
The hearing was interrupted by the events of September 11th, but
Chaparral residents came to the hearing and expressed their over-
whelming opposition to the proposed landfill. They spoke about their
reasons for coming to Chaparral, which included seeking clean air and
drinking water. They also expressed their concerns about Chaparral
being overrun by industrial sites and turned into a dumping ground,
and their fears that the proposed landfill would bring flies, dust, noise,
traffic, and pollution.
The NMED Hearing Officer who conducted the hearing let the people
from the community speak, often conducting the hearing into the early
morning hours. After voicing the position that NMED has taken for
years, the Hearing Officer also made clear that the Department
would make its decision based only on technical issues (such as
the design of the liner for the landfill), and that concerns
expressed by the members of the community would not be taken
into account by the Department in determining whether to issue
a permit for the landfill. The Hearing Officer also refused to let a
member of the community, Dr. Diana Bustamante of the Colonias
Development Council, question a witness for the landfill company
about the social impact that the landfill would have on the community.
The NMED Secretary issued a permit for the landfill, ruling that it was
appropriate for the Hearing Officer to have told the community
members that their testimony could not influence the ultimate
outcome, and to have refused to let Dr. Bustamante question the land-
fill witness on the landfill’s social impact. The Colonias Development
Council appealed the Secretary’s decision to the New Mexico Court of
Appeals, but that Court affirmed the Secretary’s ruling. The Court of
Appeals decided that it was proper for the Department to make its
decision based only on the technical evidence presented in the hearing,
and that the Department did not have to take into account the non-
technical opposition to the landfill expressed by members of the
community.
The Colonias Development Council, represented by Nancy Simmons,
a private attorney in Albuquerque, asked the New Mexico Supreme
Court to review the case, and the Supreme Court agreed to do so.
The Law Center filed a brief on behalf of the South Valley (of
Albuquerque) Coalition of Neighborhood Associations  supporting the
position of the Colonias Development Council; in addition, Law
Center Staff Attorney Rod Ventura participated in the oral argument
conducted by the Supreme Court. On July 18th, the Supreme Court
issued its decision, and it is an opinion that will change dramati-
cally the way that decisions are made pursuant to the Solid 
Waste Act.
The Supreme Court pointed out the provisions of the Act and of the
Regulations that require a demonstration that the proposed landfill
would not cause a hazard to public health, welfare, or the environment,
an undue risk to property, or a public nuisance. The Court also
emphasized the many provisions of the Act and the Regulations that
call for public participation in the process used to determine whether
to issue a permit for the landfill.
On the basis of those considerations, the Court held that the NMED
Secretary must consider whether the proposed landfill would create a
public nuisance or a hazard to public health, welfare, or the environ-
ment. The Court specifically pointed out the testimony of community
members that Chaparral is being overrun by industrial facilities includ-
ing numerous pre-existing landfills, and stated that the Department
should consider whether the cumulative impact of pollution, exacer-
bated by the poverty in the community, could rise to the level of a
public nuisance or a hazard to public health, welfare, or the environ-
ment. The Court specifically stated that NMED must take these
considerations into account in reviewing evidence concerning the
impact of the landfill on the quality of life in the community.
The Supreme Court ordered that the case be sent back to the NMED
for another limited hearing. The Court stated that the Colonias
Development Council would be able to present additional evidence on
the impacts of the proliferation of landfills in and around the commu-
nity. The Court also ordered that the Department allow Dr.
Bustamante to question the landfill company witness about the social
impacts of the landfill. The Court indicated as well that the landfill
company would have a reasonable opportunity to respond on behalf of
these issues.
Finally, the Court stated that the NMED Secretary would have to
explain his decision following this hearing . The Court pointed out
that it was not ruling that the Secretary would have to reach a different
result and deny the landfill company’s application, but that it was ruling
that the Secretary would have to explain why he decided to reject the
public opposition to the landfill if that was his decision.
This case marks a significant change in the way that the
Environment Department will make decisions concerning appli-
cations for permits for solid waste facilities. Since the enactment
of the Solid Waste Act in 1990, the Environment Department has
taken the position that it was limited to considering only technical
issues in applications for such permits. The Supreme Court has
changed that, and has given communities the voice concerning such
applications and permits that they should have had for the last 
fifteen years.

e are happy to announce two new Law Center board members, who bring with them a
shared love of New Mexico’s environment and a deep-rooted belief that the complex envi-
ronmental problems faced by New Mexicans must be met with solutions that are developed
with sound science and community participation.
WILLIAM DEBUYS,P H.D.
For nearly two decades, Bill has been a well-known figure in northern New Mexico as an author, histo-
rian and leader on environmental projects such as the Valles Caldera National Preserve, where he
served as Chairman and Trustee of the Valles Caldera Trust. He has also been instrumental in securing
thousands of acres of New Mexico lands for conservation, including the purchase and transfer of
Forked Lightning Ranch, which led to the establishment of the Pecos National Historical Park, and the
Valle Grande grassbank, which has served as a model for sustainable grazing practices in the West.
In Bill’s books, including Enchantment and Exploitation: the Life and Hard Times of a New Mexico Mountain
Range, he examines how how societies and their environments continually influence and alter each other
in an unending cycle of reciprocal change. He writes in the preface to Enchantment and Exploitation,
“…in an unforgiving environment, small errors yield large consequences.” It is a lesson that is at the
heart of many Law Center cases.
PETER STACEY,P H.D.
Peter has spent the last twenty years studying the ecology of the West from the point of view of an
ornithologist. As a Research Professor at the University of New Mexico for the past eight years, his
passion is restoration ecology, centering upon population ecology and genetics, behavioral ecology and
conservation ecology, including the restoration of bird communities in riparian ecosystems. His
research has been key to the dialogue about the Southwest Willow Flycatcher and the
Mexican Spotted Owl.
Reminiscing about his research on the spotted owl, he mused, “when I started out with this work, I
thought I could just do science. But the issues we face are complex and require many people with
many skills to create solutions. The way we’re doing things now, I'm afraid of the world my son will
have when he is my age. We need to work together and all make contributions to create those solutions.”
The Law Center is tremendously pleased to have these two dedicated individuals add their voices to its
board and looks forward to its new board members’ viewpoints on requests for assistance, fund-raising,
and policy matters.

nce again, the Law Center was tremendously fortunate in hosting very talented, hard-working
law clerks for the summer. Having spent the summer immersed in environmental justice work
with our attorneys, Molly McOwen, Patrick Ferguson and Kimberly Sanchez are now
beginning their second year at Columbia Law School in New York City.
What was the most challenging aspect of their jobs this summer?  There is always the steep learning
curve, as anyone who has practiced Indian law or atomic licensing law can tell you. But it is how law
gets put into practice that gave our law clerks pause, rather than the technical aspects of our cases.
"Working here, you see how the lawmaking process has an impact on communities,” said Patrick. “The
erosion of environmentally-protective laws, and the politics behind that phenomenon, really have conse-
quences for our clients.”
Kimberly remarked that the challenges she saw were similar. “Being a good environmental lawyer is not
just about lawyering,” she said. “I've learned here that it is just as much about the networks you build
with regulators, clients and elected officials.” Another challenge she saw was the difficulty of how to
provide the greatest good for the greatest number of people with limited resources.
When asked what the best part of the job was, Molly stated, “the dedication of the people - both those
with whom we worked, and the people that we represented this summer.” Our clients' dedication to their
work to protect their homes and families has inspired all three of our law clerks to continue for the
public interest in the future. And all three students concurred that the green chile and spectacular land-
scapes have definitely inspired them to return to New Mexico!
