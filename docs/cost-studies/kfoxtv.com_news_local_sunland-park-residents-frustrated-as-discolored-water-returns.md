Sunland Park Residents Frustrated as Discolored Water Returns
SUNLAND PARK, N.M. (KFOX14/CBS4) — The Camino Real Regional Utility Authority is once again facing scrutiny as residents in Sunland Park report discolored water flowing from their taps.
For over a decade, these communities have battled arsenic levels exceeding legal limits in their drinking water.
Despite ongoing efforts by CRRUA to meet state water quality standards, residents say the problem persists.
"We just want clean water," said Jose Saldana Jr. "They're killing us—slowly but surely."
Over the past year, CRRUA has been working to comply with water standards set by the New Mexico Environment Department.
But some residents say they have started seeing yellow, murky water in their homes again—including Saldana, who noticed it this week.
"They fix it for a little bit, but this has been an ongoing issue," he said.
When we reached out to CRRUA, a spokesperson attributed the discoloration on February 23rd to ongoing well repairs and claimed the issue had already been resolved.
The discolored water event that occurred on February 23, 2025, in the southern Sunland Park area has been cleared. During ongoing well repairs, CRRUA operational staff activated a backup well. This process disturbed naturally occurring sediment deposits in the water lines, causing temporary discoloration. CRRUA operational staff promptly responded to the areas where discoloration reports were received. By the time staff arrived, the water had already cleared. CRRUA remains committed to providing safe and reliable water service. If customers experience any water quality concerns, they are encouraged to contact CRRUA customer service for assistance.
However, while reporting in the area, we observed that the water was still discolored—leaving residents frustrated and looking for answers.
"We're still paying the bill, and we still have to buy water," said Saldana. "When I stay at my kids' house in Las Cruces, I feel the difference—the water is clean, and we don’t have to rely on bottled water."
