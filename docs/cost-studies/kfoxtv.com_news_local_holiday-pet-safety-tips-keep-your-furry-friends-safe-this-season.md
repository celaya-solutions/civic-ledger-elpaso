Bark on Arc: Keep your furry friends safe this Christmas
El Paso, TX (KFOX14/CBS4) — As the holiday season approaches, pet owners are reminded to take precautions to ensure their furry friends stay safe.
The Humane Society's AJ introduced The Grinch, an 11-week-old Doberman and Australian cattle dog mix, highlighting the importance of holiday safety for pets.
"He may want to chew on the tree a little bit or take some of your Christmas dinner," AJ said, emphasizing the need for supervision and safe spaces like baby gates or crates. AJ advised, "The biggest thing is always supervision. And when you can't supervise them, have a good place for them to go."
Pet owners are encouraged to keep an eye on their animals to prevent them from ingesting harmful items, ensuring a safe and joyful holiday for all.
