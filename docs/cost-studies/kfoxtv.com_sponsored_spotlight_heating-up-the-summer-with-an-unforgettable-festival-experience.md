Heating up the summer with an unforgettable festival experience
Summer is here, and in El Paso, that means one thing—it's time to party! The fourth annual Sal y Limon Street Festival is back and bigger than ever, taking over Downtown El Paso San Jacinto Plaza on Saturday, June 7, 2025.
Gus Chavez and event organizer DJ Johnny Kage gave KFOX the inside scoop on what festival goers can expect from this year’s ultimate celebration of tacos, tequila, and live music.
“This is the largest taco, tequila, and music festival in the Southwest,” said Chavez. “We’re going all out for year four with three music stages, tons of family-friendly activities, and local vendors serving up the sights, smells, and tastes of our local community.”
From authentic eats to refreshing drinks and unforgettable beats, there’s something for everyone.
If you’re coming for the music (and who isn't?), DJ Johnny Kage has you covered.
“We are thrilled to have Los Tucanes de Tijuana headlining our main stage this year,” Kage announced.
Fans of Latin pop rock will love Corazón de Maná. And for those who prefer to dance the night away, the Pura Party Stage and the Tequilocos Stage is where the party’s at—with DJs Ray Burger, DJ Irene, and Kage himself spinning high-energy sets all day long.
“It’s not just a concert—it’s an experience,” said Kage.
The Sal y Limón Festival is more than just fun—it’s a celebration of culture and community in the Borderland region. “With many festivals disappearing in recent years, we’re proud to be growing year after year,” said Kage. “But we can’t do it without support from El Paso, Las Cruces, and Juárez. This is a party for all of us.”
