In 2003, the Law
Center received
approximately 
70 requests for
assistance from across 
New Mexico.  We provided
advice to 16 requestors,
and took on 11 new
cases.
As you have no doubt noticed, the format
and size of this issue of The Green Fire
Report are different from previous issues.
The reason for that is the Law Center's
need to cut expenses wherever possible
because of the reductions in funding pro-
vided to the Law Center by foundations.
Since September 11, 2001, many founda-
tions have experienced serious losses in
the stock market where they had much of
their assets invested.  One extreme exam-
ple is provided by a national foundation
that has provided substantial funding to
the Law Center and other groups in New
Mexico; that foundation has lost a total of
about four fifths of the assets that it had
prior to September 11th.
The losses experienced by foundations
that support the Law Center have had a
direct impact on our budget,  resulting in
a prediction that the Law Center will be
facing a deficit of more than $100,000 for
the fiscal year that ends on June 30, 2004.
There are only two positive points about
these developments.  The first is that we
are being forced to develop new sources
of funding and new ways of saving
money.  Despite the circumstances that
are forcing us to take those actions, they
are productive measures that will serve
the Law Center well in the future.  
The second positive point is that the
foundations' difficulties are not affect-
ing the Law Center as badly as they
would have half a dozen years ago
because we have reduced our depend-
ence on foundation funding.  When we 
began a cam paign to reduce the Law
Center's reliance on foundations in 1998,
about 85% of the Law Center's funding
was provided by foundations.  We have
reduced that amount to less than 70% of
our funding.  If we had not made that
progress, the deficit we are facing would
have been considerably worse.       
Even so, the deficit we are facing could
force staff reductions in 2004.  With your
financial support, however, we will be
able to continue the work that makes a
difference for New Mexico's communi-
ties and environment.

FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ’S DESK
--Douglas Meiklejohn
“The inability of 
foundations to provide fund-
ing at the levels we expected
has resulted in a prediction
that the Law Center will be
facing a deficit of more than
$100,000 for the fiscal year.”

Case Updates
Editor’s Note:  Our attorneys haven’t run short
on case updates...we’ve just run short on
space. Please see all of our case updates at

Crownpoint Uranium
Project 
The litigation before the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission has not yet
resumed.  However, the Administrative
Law Judge presiding over the case has
indicated that he will be issuing a final
decision on Church Rock Section 8, the
site that we litigated between 1998 and
2000, within the next few weeks.
Immediately after issuing that decision, 
he will contact the parties to negotiate a
schedule for Phase II of the litigation.

SAGE Petroglyphs Case
SAGE Council, with the help of 1000
Friends of New Mexico, succeeded in
defeating the Street Bonds Package in the
October, 2003 Albuquerque city elections.
If approved, the street bonds would have
provided the city with money to construct
the Paseo del Norte extension through the
Petroglyph National Monument.  SAGE is
now looking toward the upcoming legisla-
tive session and anticipating the introduc-
tion of bills proposing state funding for
the city project.
Albuquerque has never complied with the
New Mexico Prehistoric and Historic
Sites Preservation Act which requires the
city to show that there are no prudent and
feasible alternatives to the Paseo del
Norte project.  In fact, the city approved
recent developments with full knowledge
that the developments would be built
across at least one of the identified alter-
natives.  If the project proceeds as pro-
posed, it would impact the Petroglyph
National Monument, cross through Las
Imagines State Historical District, and
destroy an area sacred to many
New Mexican tribes and Pueblos.
In addition to likely action in the
legislature, SAGE is working with a
transportation engineer to identify
alternatives to the proposed exten-
sion, and hopes to open a stake-
holders dialogue with Albuquerque
and west side residents to resolve
the conflicts.

Phelps Dodge Case
Continues
On behalf of the Gila Resources
Information Project (GRIP), the
Law Center filed an appeal chal-
lenging the Tyrone mine closeout/
closure permit for not providing for
early reclamation of tailing
impoundments located at the north
end of the Tyrone mine.  GRIP
withdrew this appeal after Phelps
Dodge Tyrone agreed to clean up
the Mangas Valley tailing impound-
ments within 8 years, regardless of
whether the rest of the Tyrone mine
closes within that time. 
Additionally, the Law Center repre-
sented GRIP in a hearing in which
Phelps Dodge challenged provi-
sions of the permit denying the use
of the "open pit capture zone" as
part of mine reclamation; providing
for regrading of stockpiles at a 3:1
slope; and providing for 3 foot
cover material on regraded stock-
piles.  GRIP supported these provi-
sions of the closeout/closure permit
as necessary to protect groundwater.
We anticipate that we will hear the
outcome of this hearing in the
spring of 2004.

America Pulls the Plug on Energy
Bill...for the moment
The abomination that was the Federal 
Energy Bill died this November under the
weight of its own pork-laden corpulence.
The Energy Bill, which was larded with
taxpayer giveaways to corporate donors,
would have been disastrous for the envi-
ronment and public health.  Among the
giveaways was a provision that would
have subsidized uranium mining using the
in situ leach method.  This provision,
sponsored by New Mexico Representative
Heather Wilson and Senator Pete
Domenici, would have indirectly supported
the Crownpoint Uranium Project.
Although supporters of the bill in the U.S.
Senate could not find enough support for
the bill in that house of Congress, the
Senate leadership has promised to revisit
the bill in January.
