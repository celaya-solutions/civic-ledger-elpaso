Bark on ARC: Humane Society highlights easy adoption process for dogs like Shotgun
El Paso, TX (KFOX14/CBS4) — The Humane Society is spotlighting Shotgun, an American pit bull terrier mix, as part of its efforts to find homes for dogs in need.
Shotgun, known for his "gigantic smile" and playful demeanor, has been at the shelter for about two weeks after arriving with his brother Creed from another facility.
The Humane Society often takes in transfers from other shelters to increase the dogs' chances of adoption.
The adoption process is straightforward, according to the Humane Society. "It's always same day and walk in," said a representative.
Potential adopters can visit the campus to meet animals or browse available pets online before visiting. The process operates on a first-come, first-serve basis, allowing people to meet and adopt pets like Shotgun quickly.
The Humane Society encourages those interested in adopting to visit their website or come in person to find their perfect match.
