"When I came back this year, I knew anything that I could do to help my team I was going to do it," Sims said. "We built this brotherhood and I love these guys to death. I look at them as family and I'm so grateful to have been here."
"Our team rallied behind him," Dillingham said. "This guy is a big reason why are team stay together and played so hard in this game and go on a three-game winning streak. We kept battling, but were just one play short."
Also for the Sun Devils, Jason Brown Jr. rushed for 120 yards on 12 carries, however had the costly fumble.
