Why are your lips chapped on a cold, foggy day with 100% humidity?
SEATTLE — It's foggy, cloudy, and raining in the Pacific Northwest much of the winter. Plus, the humidity is at 100%.
But why does it still feel dry? Why do your lips still get chapped and your skin get dry?
Humidity is in terms of percent.
In other words, how full the air is with respect to how much it can hold, and that is strongly dependent on temperature.
Meteorologists use a relationship called the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. It basically says the warmer the air, the more moisture it can hold in the form of water vapor.
But that rise is exponential.
If you raise the temperature a little bit, you warm the air. And warmer air allows for more water vapor.
To illustrate this point, let's talk about dew points.
Dew points are a measure of how cold you'd have to cool the air to for it to become fully saturated. Think when the ground becomes wet around dawn or dusk, or when clouds and fog begin to form.
Dew points are measured in degrees.
Our dew point on Friday in western Washington is around 40 degrees.
In Arizona, it's closer to 50 degrees.
That means there is more water vapor in the air right now in Arizona than there is in Seattle, even though it's raining, foggy, and cloudy.
It's all a result of temperature.
If you take that air with less moisture in it and pump it into indoor spaces and add heat, it becomes very dry.
And if we spend a lot of time indoors in the winter—and you're eating salty holiday treats and licking your lips—all that warmer, dry air can lead to chapped lips and dry skin.
What should you do about it?
Make sure to hydrate, even if you aren't moving as much or sweating as you are in the summer.
It's also a good idea to wear Chapstick and keep from licking your lips after eating a salty snack.
