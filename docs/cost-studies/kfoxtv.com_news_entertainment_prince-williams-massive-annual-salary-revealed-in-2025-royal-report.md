Prince William's massive annual salary revealed in 2025 royal report
Being the future king doesn’t come cheap! Prince William’s latest royal income has now been revealed.
Figures released in June’s royal report show Prince William received roughly $30 million (22.9 million) during his second year as Duke of Cornwall. The income comes from the Duchy of Cornwall estate, which William inherited when his father, King Charles III, took over the throne in 2022.
According to the Duchy’s Integrated Annual Report for 2025, the 22.9 million distributable surplus for the 2024–2025 financial year covered the official, charitable and private expenses of Prince William, Kate Middleton and their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. As a senior working royal, William does not receive a conventional salary. Instead, his duties and household costs are mostly funded through the Duchy.
Established in 1337 by King Edward III, the Duchy of Cornwall was created to support the heirs to the throne. Today, the estate is valued at more than $1 billion and spans roughly 130,000 acres across 23 counties in England and Wales, including farms, landholdings, homes, and commercial properties.
Prince William does pay income tax on the income he receives from the Duchy after household expenses, though specific numbers have not been disclosed.
Since taking on the role, William has been actively involved in managing the estate. Royal sources previously said he was “fully immersing himself” in his responsibilities, including visits to Duchy projects such as an innovative housing development in Newquay geared toward tackling homelessness.
Looking ahead, the Duchy of Cornwall remains focused on its long-term goal of "becoming a net zero estate by the end of 2032."
