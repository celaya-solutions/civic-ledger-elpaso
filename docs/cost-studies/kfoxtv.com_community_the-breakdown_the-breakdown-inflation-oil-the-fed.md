The Breakdown: Inflation, Oil & the Fed
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — In this episode of The Breakdown, Brad Montgomery sits down with economics professor Carlos Aguilar from EPCC to make sense of where the U.S. economy stands under the new administration. From inflation and the Fed’s wait-and-see approach to tariffs, oil production, and renewable energy, the conversation covers the shifts shaping our financial future. Is inflation under control? Will manufacturing return to the U.S.? Why are gas prices dropping but your electricity bill going up? Find out how national policy affects your wallet — and El Paso’s local economy.
As the new presidential administration settles in, the state of the U.S. economy is under scrutiny, particularly regarding inflation and fiscal policy. Carlos Aguilar, an economics professor at DPC, discussed the current economic landscape, noting that inflation, a major concern for many, has shown signs of moderation.
"The good news and continuing good news was that, during the previous administration, the last four months, prices started to moderate and started declining," Aguilar said. "During the early months of the new administration, prices seemed to want to go up. But then the most recent indicator of prices, consumer price index, took a nice little decrease."
Aguilar expressed optimism about inflation, stating, "I honestly expect that inflation, given other conditions, should moderate."
The Federal Reserve's stance remains cautious amid these developments. Aguilar explained, "The Fed right now is in a position where it doesn't get clarification that inflation is yet under control. And the other big issue they have is they're not clear where tariffs are going to take us."
He added, "They're neither hawkish or conservative. They're just holding their ground right now."
Consumer confidence, which had been bleak in the early months of 2025, showed a positive turn recently. Aguilar noted, "Surprisingly, this last month, the consumer confidence indicator just 2 or 3 days ago became positive."
Despite these positive signs, Aguilar cautioned that one month does not make a trend, and consumers remain cautious due to persistent high prices.
On the topic of tariffs, Aguilar highlighted the uncertainty they bring to the business environment. "The one thing that business worldwide does not like is when you have instability and uncertainty," he said.
Regarding energy policy, Aguilar mentioned that the new administration has relaxed some environmental laws to encourage more oil production. However, he noted, "I don't know how much more production we can do."
As the economy continues to navigate these challenges, Aguilar emphasized the importance of monitoring economic indicators and remaining informed about potential shifts in policy and market conditions.
