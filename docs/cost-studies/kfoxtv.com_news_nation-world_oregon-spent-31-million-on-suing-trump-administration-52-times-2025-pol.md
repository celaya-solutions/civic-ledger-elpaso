Oregon spent $3.1 million on suing Trump administration 52 times in 2025
The state of Oregon filed 52 lawsuits against the Trump administration in 2025.
KATU obtained records that show the state spent $3.1 million on those lawsuits.
The state spent the most money, about $855,000, on challenging the deployment of National Guard troops into Portland. The second most expensive lawsuit was on challenging tariffs imposed by the Trump administration at a total cost of about $500,000. The third most expensive lawsuit was challenging the freeze of federal funds in early 2025 at a total cost of about $115,000.

However, those lawsuits helped safeguard $4.5 billion, according to the Oregon Justice Department.
For example, by suing the Trump administration over the funding freeze, the state safeguarded about $696 million in funds. According to the Oregon Department of Justice, those funds were intended for FEMA disaster assistance, energy-efficient upgrades to residential and commercial properties, CDC grants to support community-based programs working to prevent sexual violence, and funding to connect job candidates with employment opportunities.
As for the source of the money that was spent on suing the Trump administration, it comes from a few different sources.
According to the Oregon Attorney General's office, the Oregon Department of Justice (DOJ) receives 21% its funding from the state's General Fund. The rest comes from fees, legal service charges, and federal grants.
Additionally, thanks to funding from the state legislature, the Oregon DOJ was able to create a federal litigation team, which ultimately took the Trump administration to court on multiple occasions. The department also doubled its capacity to take on consumer protection work. Finally, the department hired 33 attorneys in its trial division, which helped it rely less on outside counsel and saved the state money.
Below is a list taken directly from the Oregon DOJ's website, which shows how $4.5 billion was safeguarded by lawsuits:
NIH Indirect Costs (Massachusetts v. National Institutes of Health, D. Mass., 25-CV-10338)
The district court issued a permanent injunction preserving negotiated indirect cost rates, saving approximately $80 million in funding for Oregon Health & Science University alone. The negotiated rate supports critical facilities costs, payroll, and infrastructure used to support clinical trials and other research. The funds saved support research in areas including fetal-maternal medicine, cancer, cardiovascular health, infectious disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and behavioral health.
OMB Funding Freeze Memo (New York v. Trump, D.R.I., 1:25-cv-00039)
The district court issued a preliminary injunction and two enforcement orders that prohibit the Trump Administration from freezing certain federal grant funding to states pursuant to a January 27, 2025 OMB memo. A rough estimate of the Oregon funds preserved through this litigation is $696 million. Just a few examples of those funds include funding for FEMA disaster assistance; energy efficient upgrades to residential and commercial properties; CDC grants to support community-based programs working to prevent sexual violence; and funding that supports connecting job candidates with employment opportunities.
Termination of Public Health Grants (Colorado v. U.S. Dept of Health & Human Services, D.R.I., 1:25-cv-00121)
The district court issued a preliminary injunction that prohibits the Trump Administration from terminating $117 million in critical public health grants to the Oregon Health Authority. Just a few examples of those funds include funding for vaccination programs for children; substance abuse and mental health services grants; and funding to support real-time emerging public health responses (such as a measles outbreak, opioid overdose epidemic, and threats associated with summer wildfires).
Gender-affirming Care (Washington v. Trump, W.D.Wash. 2:25-cv-00244)
The district court issued a preliminary injunction that prohibits federal agencies from terminating federal research or education grants to medical institutions (including medical schools and hospitals) that provide gender-affirming care. The impact to Oregon institutions going forward is likely similar to the numbers we reported in our lawsuit (for example, Oregon Health & Science University received $413 million in federal research awards in 2023; Oregon State University received $371 million in federal research awards in 2024).
Gutting IMLS and Other Small Agencies (Rhode Island v. Trump, D.R.I., 1:25-cv-00128)
The district court issued a preliminary injunction barring the Trump administration from gutting several smaller federal agencies, including the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The impact to Oregon is $2.6 million in federal funding for Oregon libraries. Those funds support the State Library of Oregon’s work to help local libraries serve their communities better, with services like loaning books to libraries in 15 rural counties. It also helps fund programs like the Oregon Battle of the Books competition, which encourages thousands of Oregon students to read (and to have fun while reading).
ESSER Funding Terminations (New York v. U.S. Department of Education, S.D.N.Y., 1:25-cv-02990)
The district court issued a preliminary injunction barring the U.S. Department of Education from terminating critical Department of Education programs that support low-income and unhoused students and that provide funding for other services to address the long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on K-12 students. Impact to Oregon is $4.3 million.
DOT Terms and Conditions (California v. U.S. Department of Transportation, D.R.I., 1:25-cv-00208)
The district court issued a preliminary injunction—and, later, a permanent injunction—barring the U.S. Department of Transportation from imposing certain terms and conditions for grants. Those conditions attempted to illegally coerce states into performing federal immigration enforcement functions by threatening essential infrastructure funding. An estimated $1.65 billion in federal funding to the Oregon Department of Transportation was at stake for the next biennial budget. And an estimated $12 million in federal funding to the Oregon Department of Aviation was at stake, affecting planned projects during the next year.
NIH Grant Delays/terminations (Massachusetts v. Kennedy, D. Mass., 1:25-cv-10814)
The district court entered a partial final judgment prohibiting the National Institute of Health from terminating or delaying essential NIH grants. That judgment protects more than $6.5 million in grants within Oregon.
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Grants (Washington v. U.S. Dept of Transportation, W.D. Wash. 2:25-cv-00848)
The district court issued a preliminary injunction barring the U.S. Department of Transportation from terminating billions of dollars of congressionally approved funding for electric vehicle infrastructure. That injunction makes available approximately $15 million of funding that the Oregon Department of Transportation had not yet obligated and that the Federal Highway Administration improperly withdrew.
Education Funding Freezes (California v. McMahon, D.R.I., 1:25-cv-00329)
Oregon and a coalition of states sued the Trump Administration over its unconstitutional and arbitrary decision to freeze funding for six longstanding U.S. Department of Education programs just weeks before the school year began. After that lawsuit was filed, the government agreed to release those funds. As a result, Oregon will receive an estimated $80 million that had wrongly been frozen. Among other things, that funding supports essential after-school learning programs, teacher preparation efforts, and critical support for students learning English and adult literacy education.
DHS Terms and Conditions (Illinois v. FEMA, D.R.I., 1:25-cv-00206)
Oregon and a coalition of states sued the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies, challenging new terms and conditions for essential emergency preparedness and response grants. Those conditions attempt to illegally coerce states into performing federal immigration enforcement functions in order to receive those funds. After that lawsuit was filed, the government backed down on the majority of these grants. Although funding varies year to year, during the 2024 fiscal year the Oregon Department of Emergency Management obligated $833 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FEMA Disaster Mitigation Grants (Washington v. FEMA, D. Mass., 1:25-cv-12006)
The district court issued a preliminary injunction that prohibits the federal government from spending funds allocated to the FEMA Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program on other, non-BRIC purposes while litigation is pending. That relief prevents the government from reallocating billions of dollars in disaster mitigation funds, including more than $128 million in BRIC funding for 29 open projects in Oregon. Those projects include nearly $14 million in federal funds to help Clatsop County prepare for a potential Cascadia subduction zone earthquake and tsunami; nearly $35 million for critical infrastructure improvements to the City of Medford’s water distribution system; and $50 million to help the City of Grants Pass move its existing water treatment plant outside of a flood hazard area.
Funding Cuts to State Energy Program (New York v. U.S. Dept of Energy, D. Or., 6:25-cv-01458)
Oregon and a coalition of states sued the Department of Energy challenging a policy that capped the percentage of grant money that governments could use for state energy programs, such as expenses related to more than one grant program (so-called “indirect costs”) and certain expenses related to personnel. The district court ruled in the states’ favor on summary judgment that the policy was contrary to the Department of Energy’s own laws and regulations. The ruling preserved around $1.05 million in federal funding for Oregon in 2025 and more in future years.
Funding Cuts to Services for Victims and Survivors of Crime (New Jersey v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, D.R.I., 1:25-cv-00404)
Use Restriction on Grants for Victims and Survivors of Crime (New York v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, D.R.I., 1:25-cv-00499) – Oregon Department of Justice
Oregon and a coalition of states sued the U.S. Department of Justice twice, challenging proposed conditions for Victims of Crime Act grants, which provide essential services to victims and survivors across Oregon. Those conditions would have illegally coerced states into performing federal immigration enforcement functions, putting VOCA funding at risk in Oregon and several other states. Additionally, the conditions would have cut off critical legal services for survivors who could not immediately prove their immigration status. After those lawsuits were filed, the government backed down and declined to impose those unlawful conditions. As a result, Oregon will receive $19 million in VOCA funds during Fiscal Year 2025 that had been threatened by the proposed conditions.
Funding Threats to Sexual Education Programs (Washington v. U.S. Dept. Of Health & Human Svcs., D. Or., 6:25-cv-01748)
Oregon and a coalition of states sued the Department of Health and Human Services and its Administration for Children and Families over their directive to remove references to gender identity and LGBTQ+ from two longstanding teen reproductive and sexual health education grant programs. The district court issued a preliminary injunction setting aside the directives, preserving $1.175 million in federal funds to Oregon agencies that design and implement sexual health education programs to teens and young adults, including Oregon’s My Future-My Choice curriculum.
SNAP Benefits Appropriations Lapse (Massachusetts v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, D. Mass., 1:25-cv-13165)
A multistate coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the District of Massachusetts for failing to issue benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in November because of the government shutdown. A coalition of nonprofit and other groups also sued the USDA in the District of Rhode Island. Both courts issued temporary restraining orders requiring USDA to pay at least partial benefits from contingency funds, and to consider shifting other available funds over to pay for full benefits, which the USDA declined to do. Ultimately, because of the delay associated with states attempting to issue partial benefits, the Rhode Island court ordered USDA to release funds to pay full benefits to all SNAP recipients. Oregon was able to process full November benefits to its SNAP recipients—around $134 million—after that order, which was later appealed.
