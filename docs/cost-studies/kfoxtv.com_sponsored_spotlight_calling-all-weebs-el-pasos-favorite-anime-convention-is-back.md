Calling all weebs: El Paso's favorite anime convention is back!
Anime El Paso is right around the corner, bringing with it a packed schedule full of celebrity guests, cosplay contests, unique attractions, and fan-favorite challenges. We paid a visit to our good friend Troy Stegner to get the inside scoop on what attendees can expect this year.
When asked to describe the event in one word, Stegner didn’t hesitate: “It’s going to be freaking amazing!”
And from the looks of it, he’s not exaggerating.
Anime El Paso is pulling out all the stops with a stellar guest lineup. Attendees can expect appearances from Dante Basco (Prince Zuko in "Avatar: The Last Airbender"), Todd Haberkorn, Lisa Ortiz, and even a voice actor from "Five Nights at Freddy’s"—the voice behind Happy Frog.
“We try to cover all the major animes,” said Stegner. “So, voiceover stuff, we got it.”
No anime convention is complete without cosplay, and Anime El Paso promises some serious costume action. There will be an adult cosplay contest on Saturday at 7 p.m. with both individual and group categories. Expect to see everything from classic anime favorites to current characters.
For younger fans, a kids’ cosplay contest is scheduled for Sunday at noon.
“It’s basically a little kid parade,” Stegner explained. “They’ll still be judged, and winners will receive trophies and prizes.”
Beyond the panels and cosplay, Anime El Paso is loaded with one-of-a-kind attractions. Some highlights include:
- An anime-themed escape room
- Aerial performances
- A maid café experience
- Spicy ramen eating contest – and it’s not for the faint of heart. “You have to sign a waiver to participate,” Stegner warned.
Tickets for Anime El Paso are available now at animeelpaso.com. Military members can also take advantage of a discount by verifying their status through the site. “We don’t want stolen valor, so you’ll need to go through the verification process,” Stegner noted.
Before making your way on down, Stegner has one last piece of advice for attendees: “Dress comfortably, bring good walking shoes, and come with an open mind ready to have fun.”
There’s so much in store; Anime El Paso is shaping up to be an unforgettable weekend for anime fans across the borderland.
