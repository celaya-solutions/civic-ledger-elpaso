'MEOW-1': Could your pet be on weight loss drugs? Company launches clinical trial
(TNND) — A cat on weight loss drugs?
Pharmaceutical company Okava Pharmaceuticals is launching a clinical trial into weight loss drugs for cats, according to multiple reports, in the first trial of its kind.
Some call it 'the next big thing," said Dr. Ernie Ward, a veterinarian and the founder of the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, according to The New York Times.
The company is calling it MEOW-1 and the trial is testing the drug in the form of an implant.
"Weight management offers transformative health benefits for cats. Weight reduction is the only proven means of extending a cat’s lifespan. Leaner cats have significantly reduced diabetes risk, and joint pain associated with excess body weight is eliminated," read a description from Okava regarding the study, according to ABC News.
Okava's study will look at 50 cats who take the implant. The company said early studies were safe and beneficial for pets.
Unlike human weight loss drugs, it's not an injection.
“You insert that capsule under the skin, and then you come back six months later, and the cat has lost the weight,” said Dr. Chen Gilor, a veterinarian at the University of Florida, who is leading the study, according to The New York Times.
The goal for the company: FDA approval by 2027 or 2028, with the cost being $100 per month.
Results for the study are expected next summer, according to The New York Times. Up next on the list for Okava, dogs.
