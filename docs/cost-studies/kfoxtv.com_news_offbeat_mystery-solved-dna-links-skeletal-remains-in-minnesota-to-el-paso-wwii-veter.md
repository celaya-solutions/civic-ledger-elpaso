Mystery solved: DNA links skeletal remains in Minnesota to El Paso WWII veteran
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — Skeletal remains found next to a highway in Minnesota 10 years ago have been identified as belonging to a World War II veteran from El Paso.
According to the DNA Doe Project, a non-profit organization that works to identify and reunite John and Jane Does with their families through DNA technology, it identified remains found next to I-90 near Alberta Lea, Minnesota, saying they belonged to Luis Gilberto Robledo, an El Paso native and World War II veteran who fought in the Battle of Normandy.
The organization described that the skeletal remains were found on April 6, 2015, but investigators believe Robledo could've died sometime between 2000 and 2012.
Along with Robledo's skeletal remains were a pair of Levi’s brand pants, Stafford brand underwear, Mario de Gerard shoes, a 10k gold ring with a ruby-colored stone and coins with dates ranging from 1965 to 1992.
At the time of the discovery, but before his identity was uncovered, investigators believed the man may have been Hispanic and likely 40-55 years old when he died.
However, after the DNA Doe Project got involved, everyone appeared to be caught off guard when they learned that Robledo was more likely to be in his 70s or 80s at the time of his death.
"We were very surprised when our research led us to a man born in 1923," said team co-leader Lisa Ivany from the DNA Doe Project. "The discrepancy with the age estimate was significant, but the DNA evidence clearly pointed to our John Doe being Luis Robledo."

While not much is known about Robledo, for example, investigators still don't know how he came to Minnesota and when exactly he died, investigators know that he was one of three sons from a Mexican family who immigrated to the U.S. and settled in El Paso.
They believe that Robledo later in life moved to Los Angeles and, by 1990, was living in Mexico, according to an obituary found in public records.
After the team reported their findings, investigators got in touch with Robledo's family with the help of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
One of Robledo's children then provided a DNA sample, which confirmed that the man formerly known only as Freeborn County John Doe was in fact Luis Robledo.

The DNA Doe Project emphasized that the team caught a break, saying that cases relating to Hispanic John and Jane Does are difficult, as they tend to be an underrepresented population in genealogy archives.
"Hispanic cases are often tough because that population is underrepresented in the DNA databases we have access to," said team leader Jeana Feehery. "But in this case, we were lucky to have close DNA matches on both the mother’s side and the father’s side, which allowed us to identify our John Doe’s parents within 24 hours."
