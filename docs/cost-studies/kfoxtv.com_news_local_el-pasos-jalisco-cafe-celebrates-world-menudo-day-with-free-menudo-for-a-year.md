El Paso's Jalisco Cafe celebrates World Menudo Day with free menudo for a year
EL PASO, TEXAS (KFOX14/CBS4) — New Year's Day in El Paso wouldn't be complete without menudo, and Jalisco Café is turning this tradition into a full-blown celebration.
The local restaurant is marking what it calls World Menudo Day with a special giveaway for five lucky customers.
For over 70 years, Jalisco Cafe in El Paso has been renowned for its authentic Mexican food, particularly its world-famous menudo, served every weekend.
This decades-long tradition continues to draw people back year after year.
This year, five customers win menudo for two, valid for 52 weekends in 2026.
While locals have been registering for a chance to win since Thanksgiving, the five winners were chosen on New Year's Day.
KFOX14/CBS4's photojournalist Rudy Reyes got a look at what this tradition means for the community.
