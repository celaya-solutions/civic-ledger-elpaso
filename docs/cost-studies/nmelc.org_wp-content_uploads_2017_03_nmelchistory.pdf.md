We citizens used to elect officials to government office, and they would appoint
professional staff and hire public employees. Together, they passed laws and
wrote regulations and ran the courts. They managed airports and controlled
rivers and took care of the forests. We citizens just watched, and occasionally
complained.
Shortly after World War II there was a growing consciousness that those were
our our airports and rivers and forests, that we were not satisfied with the way
government was dealing with racial matters and conservation and women's
rights, and then Vietnam. The 1960s and succeeding decades brought great
change between citizens and government, and the effects of those changes are
enormous. Citizens began to demand things of government and industry, 
not request them.
Old assumptions that forests had to be clear-cut for the benefit of lumber com-
panies and mills, that wildlife was only an impediment to progress or prey for
hunters began to be contradicted by the post-war conservation-environmental
movement. Within 20 years, an apathetic public began to take a very active and
increasingly informed role in the management of its land, as well as in many
other areas of public concern. 
Now, our forests and public lands, the disposal of waste, the siting of contami-
nating factories were too important to leave to the politicians and government
employees any longer.
And government came along, grudgingly responding to the ferment. Public laws
were passed by Congress and the states that intended for our environment to
be something more than boardfeet and subdivisions, laws like the National
Environmental Policy Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the

Endangered Species Act, the Air Quality Control Act, the Clean Water Act, and
dozens more. But the most revolutionary concept that came out of this era was
the idea that what happened in government offices was our our business, that
we had a right to know how things were decided and to have a say in them.
A far-reaching result of such radical notions was the Freedom of Information Act.
With this legislation, ordinary citizens could now find out what happens in the
bureaucracy. It made government truly accountable to the citizens, and it
became one of conservation's most effective tools. But, not surprisingly, the
people who most needed to make the government follow its laws lacked the
money and lawyers to do so. Out of this turbulence was born the non-profit, pub-
lic interest law firm.
By the 1980s, national groups like the Sierra Club, National Resources Defense
Council, and the Environmental Defense Fund had developed powerful and
effective legal programs to challenge environmental wrong-doing by govern-
ments and industries. But these organizations were not yet very active in New
Mexico and there were no local public law firms. The 1986 election brought
Garrey Carruthers to the governorship and Hal Stratton to the office of attorney
general. Both were very conservative and unfriendly to the conservation move-
ment, so it became clear that the state would not be effectively enforcing its
environmental-conservation laws.
TThhee  BBeeggiinnnniinngg
Douglas Meiklejohn had been an attorney in the New Mexico attorney general's
office for the 9 years preceding Carruthers, most recently under the strong envi-
ronmental law enforcement of Governor Toney Anaya and Attorney General Paul
Bardacke. Prior to coming to New Mexico, Doug had worked for six years in legal
aid for the poor in Arizona, first on the Tohono O'odham (formerly the Papago)
reservation and then on
consumer and domestic issues in Flagstaff. The recent innovation of local public
law firms, especially the Southern Environmental Law Center in Charlottesville,
Virginia, provided models of how New Mexico lawyers might provide effective
assistance to the public during what was shaping up as an anti-environmental
administration.
Doug was joined by Susan Tixier and Sharon Murray in establishing the New
Mexico Environmental Law Center, a non-profit public interest law firm that was
to protect the landscapes, streams, and wildlife of our state and the citizens'
rights to a safe environment. Susan, the other half of the new firm's legal staff,
was a long-time
environmental activist and had been an environmental policy advisor to
Governor Anaya. Sharon was a community and regional planner.
From the start, the Law Center did not charge its clients for its legal services,
and it would be a while before Doug received a salary. Harriet Meiklejohn, a pro-
fessional librarian who had been at home with their three kids, went back to
work, and Doug did contract legal work on the side. It must have been the most
hanging-by-a-thread law firm in New Mexico! Clearly, these lawyers would not be
among the high earners!

Fortunately, the Center was invited to share office space and coffee with
LightHawk, "The Environmental Air Force," which certainly helped stretch those
early dollars. About the most optimistic thing that could have been said in that
first year or two is that they got by! It was a great step when they received a 
small grant to hire  Consuelo Bokum as a fund-raiser and -- when some gener-
ous donations came in -- Doug was able to give up moonlighting and receive a
salary. By 1989 Sharon and Susan moved over to the new advisory council, so
Doug and Conci were the entire staff for a year.

About 46% of New Mexico consists of public land, managed by several federal
and state agencies and subject to a plethora of laws, regulations, and changing
political winds. As many citizens knew from experience, these lands and the
resources they contained were as often as not managed by agencies that had
strong empathy for those who extracted or used those resources -- the ranchers,
loggers, and miners -- to the point where the agencies often felt that the users'
financial success was a part of their mission. Moreover, in their zoning and plan-
ning decisions, some county commissions were more eager to attract jobs and
increase tax bases than they were to protect public health.
Conservation organizations that were struggling to protect the land knew that,
and people who had to live near the polluted results of bad land-use decisions
or the noxious factories of unscrupulous corporations, knew it too. Not surpris-
ingly, in its land-use fights over timber sales and the overgrazing of public land
allotments.  In their early cases, the Center represented conservation organiza-
tions such as the Sierra Club, Forest Guardians, the Audubon Society, and the
Wilderness Society.
Another early concern was solid waste issues, and the staff worked closely with
state senator Roman Maes in the 1990 passage of his Solid Waste Act. 
Audubon Society, Forest Guardians, NM Earth First!, Sierra Club --
One excellent example of the Law Center's public lands work occurred in 1998,
when the US Forest Service planned to cut 8.8 million board feet of old growth
trees on the pristine Mesa del Medio near Abiquiu. The proposed sale was on
steep slopes, which would set a USFS precedent for such destructive steep-
slope logging in New Mexico.  The area is also critical habitat for several rare
and endangered species. The clients said that the USFS had not studied the
impacts of the proposed logging, and they filed an administrative appeal under
USFS procedures. The Santa Fe National Forest intended to ignore the appeal
and approve the sale. The Center went to US District Court, and the judge
ordered a delay. In a clear victory for public lands, the Forest reluctantly agreed
to follow its own procedures and complete the appeals process before awarding
a sale contract. The USFS subsequently decided that the sale could not be con-
ducted because required studies had not been completed.

Sunland Park --  In 1991, though, a fundamental change happened when the
Center was approached by Concerned Citizens of Sunland Park, a local group
that was opposed to a medical waste incinerator close to their homes. The incin-
erator was close to two schools, had no air pollution control devices, emitted
odors, and was causing allergies and rashes among members of the Sunland
Park community. The Center represented CCSP in the six-day long permit hear-
ing conducted by the State Environment Department.  Arguments presented by
the Law Center and others caused the department to deny the permit sought by
the company operating the incinerator. (The Center also represented CCSP in a
separate case on a landfill, which they lost.)
In retrospect, the Sunland Park case was a turning point for the Center. It
revealed a major need for legal representation and assistance among a broad
class of New Mexicans who could not pay for it: community and grassroots
organizations, pueblos, and tribes that had valid issues against government or
industry but had no way of presenting their cases in legal forums. The well-
organized conservation groups generally had at least some access to legal aid,
and were not so dependent on free assistance, but the poor and grassroots
groups did not. 
There was in those years the public awakening of a new idea that came to be
known as "environmental justice," that society and government had no right to
burden poor communities with the industries, landfills, incinerators, and pollu-
tion that more affluent communities would not accept. In fact, the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and subsequent regulations written by the US Environmental
Protection Agency specifically prohibited environmental injustice. The Center
would continue to support and represent conservation organizations, but work-
ing with community groups and Indians became the Center's mainstay. Both the
substance of the Law Center's cases and its clientele changed.

The opening of governments at all levels, the new access to previously con-
cealed government information,  reports, decisions, and reports, and the federal
and state laws that mandated real change, had made something new happen:
citizens could now play an active, informed role in public affairs. But all of these
great improvements were of no avail if the citizen lacked a lawyer to guide him
through the administrative and court proceedings. Without professional help
through the legal complexities (that government agencies and private corpora-
tions were fully able to handle), citizen and community groups were no better off
than had all those changes never occurred. Although the objectives and philoso-
phy of the Center coincided perfectly with the conservation organizations, they
also coincided with those of the grassroots groups, and those groups' need for
free legal aid was clearly greater. 
Filling this vacuum became the NMELC's role.

The cases and clients that have come the Center's way since the Concerned
Citizens of Sunland Park in 1991 are a catalog of environmental-conservation
problems in New Mexico and are spread across the map. Our clients tend to be
"watchdog" groups that consist of grassroots citizen participants who are very
aware of events around them and are quite familiar with their area. Some of
them are long-term, formal organizations with their own experts and profession-
als; others are ad-hoc groups that come together under the pressure of some-
thing bad being done to them or the place they love. Some of them will still be
active years from now; some will stay together only until their problem is correct-
ed. What they have in common is that they are fighting mad about an injustice
to them or their land, and are committed to doing something about it. And they
need a lawyer. 
We used to hear the charge -- made by corporations or government officials who
were feeling pressure from angry citizens -- that the voices being raised and the
law suits being filed were by outside agitators. Below, we present some of our
our "outside agitators":
1993 Valencia County Concerned Citizens Association (Los Lunas)
The association opposed a private company's plan to build a medical waste
incinerator. It would emit large amounts of hazardous chemicals, including
extremely toxic dioxins, into their community. State regulations require a mini-
mum distance of three miles to protect residents from such dangerous emis-
sions, but the company wanted to build it only 1/4 mile from the nearest home.
The facility would use 35,000 gallons of water per day, and dispose of the ash
in an unsafe way. Los Lunas was the company's preferred location only for its
convenience. Represented by the Law Center in proceedings before the state
Environment Department, the Concerned Citizens won. 
1993 Thomas Wootten Even when the law or courts open up the closed gov-
ernment-industry game, a government agency sometimes tries to slam it shut
again. Mr. Wootten, a non-rancher, applied to BLM to be involved as an "affected
interest" in the agency's decision making on a grazing allotment in which he had

considerable interest. BLM denied him the right to participate, but that status
was was granted to the allotment holder, two rancher-related organizations, and
adjacent land owners. The Center filed an administrative protest with BLM on
Mr. Wootten's behalf. The issue raised was the right of the non-ranching public
to participate in BLM decision-making on the management of the public's lands.
BLM withdrew its refusal, and Mr. Wootten was granted the rights he sought.
1994 Friends of Santa Fe County Pegasus Gold corporation/LAC Minerals
had a gold mine in the Ortiz Mountains whose groundwater discharge plan and
long-term cleanup bond were under consideration by the Environment
Department. Pollution, especially toxic cyanide used in a leaching process, was
coming from a pile of spent ore, and from acidic drainage coming off a pile of
waste rock. Both were draining into ground water. The Law Center argued
against both the plan for capturing the drainage and the company's lack of
bonding to ensure cleanup after the mine's eventual closure. The Friends were
able to settle on both issues: that steps must be taken to prevent further pollu-
tion and that bond must be posted to assure that the cleanup process would be 
completed. (The case began a long association between the Center and the
Friends' leader, Jeanie Cragin, who became a board member and is currently the
president.)
1997 South Valley Coalition of Neighborhood Associations (Albuquerque
South Valley) and Isleta Pueblo Southwest Landfill Inc. applied to the
Environment Department for a permit that would expand use of an existing land-
fill from accepting only demolition and construction waste to also include munic-
ipal waste. This would constitute a danger to the local ground water, as well as
triple the traffic to and from the landfill through a residential neighborhood. The
South Valley is a notable example of the Center's fights against environmental
injustice, the dumping of undesirable and hazardous things on poor communi-
ties. The area already contained the existing landfill, a waste transfer station,
two superfund sites, and the Albuquerque waste water plant. The permit was
granted. In 1999, the Center filed an environmental justice complaint under the
1964 Civil Rights Act against the Environment Department. They charge that
NMED's decision results in disproportionate impacts and risks being imposed on
the predominantly minority South Valley and on Isleta Pueblo. The EPA has not
ruled on the complaint because the landfill lacks a zoning permit that it needs
to expand. 
1997 Concerned Citizens del Norte (Questa) The NM Mining Act specifically
delegated authority to regulate hard rock mining to the Environment
Department. Governor Gary Johnson issued an executive order that attempted
to override that provision of the law. The Law Center filed suit opposing the
order, on the grounds that it violated the state constitutional requirement of sep-
aration of powers. Governor Johnson withdrew the executive order.

their lands. Their communities throughout New Mexico have long been threat-

sacred sites that are critical to their ways of life. The contamination caused by mod-

ern society tends to concentrate in communities that have the least political and
economic power, and that has often meant Indian communities. Historically, pueb-
los and reservations have been considered by environmentally destructive indus-
tries (as well as their allies in state and local governments) as places here business
can be conducted less expensively and with little resistance.
San Ildefonso Pueblo Some of the land that was taken by the government to cre-
ate Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1940s belonged to the Pueblo; since
then, San Ildefonso has been an uneasy neighbor of a facility that answers to a
national constituency, not a local one. The lab is atop a mesa, and several of its
canyons drop down into the Pueblo's land. For decades, liquid waste from the lab's
weapons research and development have been disposed of in these canyons, end-
ing up on the Pueblo. The Pueblo and Law Center pursued three major issues with
the Lab's controller, the Department of Energy: the continuing contamination of San
Ildefonso's air, water, and soil; the destruction of many sacred cultural sites; and
the government's dealings with the Pueblo as an independent sovereign govern-
ment. 
Taos Pueblo The Pueblo and Center oppose plans to expand the Taos airport. The
expansion would increase air traffic, diminish the integrity of Pueblo lands, and
decrease the privacy of their religious practices. The Federal Aviation Administration
agreed to allow the Pueblo to help select an ethnographic team to work with the
Pueblo to evaluate impacts of the proposed expansion. The case is ongoing. 
Eastern Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining Navajo Diné Against
Uranium Mining (ENDAUM) and Southwest Research and Information Center
(SRIC) The clients and the Center oppose a license granted by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for a proposed uranium leach mine near the Navajo com-
munities of Crownpoint and Church Rock. If the license stands, Hydro Resources,
Inc. would use high quality ground water in the leaching process, with likelihood of
contaminating the communities' sole source of drinking water. The uranium pro-
cessing plant would be located within 1/2 mile of schools, churches, businesses,
and most of Crownpoint's residential areas. After five years of litigation, the Law
Center won two important precedent-setting victories: first, the NRC Commissioners
ruled that HRI must have an approved restoration plan and financial surety at each
site before it would be able to begin mining at that site; second, the Commissioners
ruled that HRI cannot bifurcate, or split up, it's mining license. The case is ongoing. 
Picuris Pueblo and Vecinos del Rio (Velarde) Oglebay Norton Specialty Minerals,
Inc. has an existing mica mine near the Pueblo, and intends to expand it. The issue
is that the new mine will be on the Pueblo's ancestral land, land that is important to
it for cultural and religious activities that are practiced there. Specifically, it is a
source area for a special mica-laden clay that is used in their famed pottery mak-
ing, a cultural, economic, and religious tradition for hundreds of years. The Mining
and Minerals Division granted the company a permit, and Picuris Pueblo lost its
appeal in the Court of Appeals. Despite this loss, the Pueblo won on a critical issue
with national ramifications: the Pueblo argued that the US Forest Service should
not allow waste-rock dumps on mining claims; when the Forest Service agreed with
the Law Center and our colleagues at the Western Mining Action Project, it limited
the growth of the mine to the land which the company owns. The case is ongoing.  
The Law Center has a long relationship with its Pueblo and tribal clients. We've won
some and lost some, but in every case we raised issues that the non-Indian society
tended to overlook.
“The Center recognizes the
unique obstacles that
Indian tribes and communi-
ties face in their struggle
to preserve their lands, cul-
tures, and sovereignty from
outside threats. 
Its people are dedicated 
to their mission,
they know the process,
they are experts, and know
the language. The Indians
must work within a legal
and governmental system
that they didn't choose,
much less design, but their
lives and lands depend on 
making it work for them, 
not against them.”

The Green Fire Report was born with the Law Center. Tom Arrandale edited the
Report for two years, but he did more: Tom set a high standard, one that the
Center has built on during the succeeding 13 years. For its first year or so, the
GFR was a free agent that carried informative articles (from a conservation-envi-
ronmental viewpoint) on issues affecting New Mexico. It also carried occasional
articles about the Center's activities, but it wasn't really a forum for the Center 
yet. Consuelo Bokum came to the Center in 1989 as a fund-raiser, and soon
became the editor of GFR. During her six years as editor, Conci made the Report
what it is today: a dynamic, unfettered - one might almost say "crusading" --
newsletter. 
It is a "house organ" in the sense that it informs the Center's members and
clients, as well as the public, of what the Center is doing. Looking through back
issues one can learn not only what cases we took, but can follow the successes
and disasters in cases that sometimes last for years. And it tells the conserva-
tion side of New Mexico land, water, zoning, and mining issues.
Those who think that lawyers can't write haven't read the Green Fire Report!
Doug Meiklejohn, for one, has written many excellent articles that analyze and
explain conservation problems, as well as what the legal issues are and their
sometimes torturous progress through agencies and courts. Doug Wolf, for
another, makes understandable the arcane nuances of what lawyers do, and
also writes beautifully. An example was his slightly acerbic description of Richard
Cook's El Cajete mine in the Jemez Mountains and his legal maneuvers to make
a new mine look like an old one ("It brings to mind the old con game involving
three shells and a ball.") David Henderson, a board member since 1989 and its
former president, has written many informative articles on nature and conserva-
tion matters, as did former president Edith Pierpont and many outside writers.
Beginning in 1990, and lasting for several years, Conci put out occasional Fact
Sheets. Each one provided a detailed, informative background on an issue of
interest to people active in conservation fights. The first of the series dealt with
the Freedom of Information Act: how to use it and what the citizen's rights are.
Fact Sheets followed on the hows and whats of lobbying the NM legislature, the
National Environmental Policy Act, the NM Environmental Board, and an environ-
mental action guide on how to protect NM from mining abuses. 
Another series of issues, beginning in 1992, explored current conservation
issues, each from the perspectives of several authors. They were written by spe-
cialists, but for laypeople. Successive GFRs have dealt with, among other sub-
jects, riparian issues, grazing and rangelands, takings, endangered species,
solid waste disposal, and environmental justice. 
The GFR has done two things, and done them well. It has been the Center's
house publication, explaining what we do and why. And it is a strong, well-
informed voice for the environment and the sensible use of our land.
In addition to its informative Green Fire Report, there are other aspects to the
Law Center's self-assigned education role. The best example of this is the report

Water budgets are much discussed and their need is widely acknowledged now,
but this report and the discussion it encouraged occurred in 1993. It was a
carefully reasoned scientific analysis of a problem that the report argued finally
had to be confronted. Today, Santa Fe has a water budget, and part of the credit
is due to the Center and Bokum, Gabin, and Grant.
Another example is a series of workshops on the taxation of open space land
that were presented in 1993 and 1994. They dealt with a problem that has
become common: land has become so valuable that heirs often must sell their
land to pay estate taxes. The workshops offered ways to avoid the trap that
causes family lands and farms to be auctioned off or subdivided.

The Law Center's clients have always been from the grassroots organizations
and communities of New Mexico. It is important that our board -- which makes
important decisions on how the firm operates and decides which cases will be
accepted - live in the communities where our clients live, hence they know those
people and understand why they come to us. It is an organization of Native
Americans, Hispanics, and Anglos, just like our state.
The Center receives many more requests for help than it can fulfill with its limit-
ed resources. The staff studies the requests on the basis of criteria: Which ones
have the greatest potential impact on the environment? Is the affected commu-
nity actively involved in the fight? Is there an environmental justice/minority
issue involved? Do the potential clients have available other sources of legal
assistance? Will the case set a useful legal precedent? And does the Center
have the resources to undertake it?
The staff makes recommendations on cases to the executive committee, and
the entire board makes the final decision. In those cases that can't be taken,
the staff attorneys will meet with the people seeking assistance and offer them
legal advice or guidance on where to turn for help. 
The board of directors made a difficult -- one might say wrenching -- decision in
fall of 2000: to begin charging clients for the legal services they receive. After
13 years of providing free service, and cognizant of the financial status of our
clients, it was an emotional decision with much ambivalence. In some cases the
Law Center had charged for expenses, such as travel, filing fees, copying, and
outside experts. But the economics of this small non-profit law firm required the
new approach.
Further, the members of the board, including those from some of our client com-
munities, recognized that charging fees would provide a "buy in" to the some-
times lengthy and always frustrating legal process. The fees are based on the
cost to the Law Center of providing the services, which includes the seniority of
the attorney. As of the fall of 2002, the Law Center has a fee range of $40-
$60/hour. Cases that were ongoing in January 2001 will continue to receive

free legal service until they reach a conclusion. The board well understands that
paying fees will be difficult for some clients, and will be flexible with regard to
the amounts and the payment schedules. 
Above all, the board and staff are committed to the work they do and will not
allow the matter of fees to stand in the way of that work. Fees or no fees, they
will continue to provide legal services where they are most needed.

The New Mexico Environmental Law Center shouldn't have to exist! The 70-plus peo-
ple who have worked for the organization these 15 years have been trying to work
themselves out of a job. But, sadly, it hasn't happened, and we don't yet see signs that
government and industry are fully committed to environmental
protection and treating citizens fairly. The legal and economic problems that called
these people to their tasks in 1987 still exist.
We still hold that the public is supposed to be able to depend on its state and federal
governments to pursue the public interest. However, as Doug Meiklejohn wrote in the
Fall 2001 GFR,
"A community that is opposing plans for a proposed facility or advocating for the clean-
up of contamination, will usually find that it is up against both the company that oper-
ates or is proposing the facility and the staff of the federal or state agency that has
regulatory control over the facility. Often those agencies will refer to the industries that
they regulate as their customers, raising the obvious question of how they regard com-
munities and the environment."
In other words, our clients and so many like them are playing with a marked deck --
and it's not they who can read the marks.
- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is supposed to protect public health and safety,
but, as the Navajos of ENDAUM learned, it has often been the advocate and guardian
of the nuclear industry.
- Although the entrance to every national forest calls itself "Land of Many Uses," and
the law unequivocally mandates that it be so, our clients have learned time and again
that the US Forest Service puts mining, the cutting of timber, and grazing above all
other uses and values.
- As the Zunis and Picuris learned, the New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division has
cut many corners for the industry it nominally regulates, and the Environment
Department has often looked the other way. The result is that the mining industry
takes from the ground -- often our our ground -- what is of value to it, disregards the
environmental damage it causes, and walks away from the mess when it is done. A
small number of owners and investors make money, sometimes a lot of it, and the
rest of us are left to live with the mess or fix it the best we can.

- BLM manages land that belongs to all of us, presumably for everybody's benefit. Yet
the agency often acts like an enthusiastic arm of the ranching industry, and tries to
keep the rest of us out of the process, as Thomas Wootten learned. With the Center's
help, he pried the tight system open a bit.
- The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) means business, but sometimes federal agen-
cies are in serious denial. That was the Forest Conservation Council's experience
when it requested information from the Forest Service in 1994, with a standard
request for a public interest waiver-of-fees for the collection of the requested informa-
tion. Although the Council is an active and effective forest advocacy group, the Santa
Fe National Forest claimed that it didn't qualify for the waiver. This was not the first
time the Forest Service tried to contravene the FOIA, so the Center appealed the deci-
sion to the Regional Forester (and lost again) and to the Chief Forester in Washington
(and won). There are some slow learners in the USFS!
The cases briefly described in this report are only a hint -- but a representative
one -- of the issues that have come to us and the people who have needed help
in our 15 years of experience. Out of this wide variety of issues and venues,
three consistent themes have emerged:
Most environmental battles are fought by local people working to protect their
families and their communities;
Minority and low income communities are most likely to suffer from pollution
and other adverse environmental impacts;
Communities working to protect their environments are almost always fighting
the government agencies that are supposed to be protecting those environments.
New Mexico is full of people who care about their environment and each other,
including some federal, state, and local employees. The staff and board of the
New Mexico Environmental Law Center have been honored to work with them to
make the state an even better place.
But the problems that have occupied them and us for 15 years go on, and on,
and so does the need for lawyers.
Year 16 begins today!
