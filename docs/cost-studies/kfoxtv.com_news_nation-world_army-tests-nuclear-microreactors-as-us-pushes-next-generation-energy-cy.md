Army tests nuclear microreactors as US pushes next-generation energy
WASHINGTON (TNND) — The U.S. Army is moving closer to deploying a new class of nuclear technology that could reshape how the United States produces reliable, low-carbon power — nuclear microreactors small enough to fit on a truck but powerful enough to run a small town.
Unlike traditional nuclear plants that span hundreds of acres, microreactors are designed to generate less than 20 megawatts of electricity and be transported fully assembled. Supporters say the technology could provide dependable power for remote communities, military bases, data centers, and college campuses, especially in areas vulnerable to grid failures.
“Like replacing a remote diesel generator in an Alaskan village or at a remote mine site, the administration is supporting all of these efforts,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright told The National News Desk during an interview in November.
The Army is now evaluating whether to install microreactors at domestic bases under its Janus program, which aims to strengthen energy security for critical military infrastructure. Nine installations are under consideration, including Fort Bragg, Fort Hood, Fort Drum, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, and Redstone Arsenal.
Army leaders say generating power on-site would reduce dependence on civilian electrical grids, which are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather, cyberattacks, and physical sabotage. On-base nuclear power could allow installations to continue operating during prolonged outages or emergencies.
The Trump administration has made advanced nuclear development a priority, promoting a range of next-generation reactor designs as part of a broader effort to revive the domestic nuclear industry.
“I want to thank President Trump for making a nuclear renaissance possible,” Wright said, adding that the Department of Energy expects to demonstrate roughly ten different reactor designs over the next two years. He said construction on small modular reactors could begin as early as next year.
Microreactors differ from larger nuclear plants in both scale and construction. Rather than being built piece by piece on site — a process that can take more than a decade — microreactors are designed to be manufactured in factories and deployed rapidly once licensed.
That model, however, presents financial challenges. Companies must make significant upfront investments to build manufacturing facilities, while potential customers often want proof of long-term reliability and regulatory approval before committing to purchases.
Public perception may prove to be an even larger obstacle. After decades of skepticism and mistrust surrounding nuclear power, experts say community acceptance will be critical before microreactors are deployed beyond military installations.
For now, the Army’s testing effort could serve as an early proving ground — one that supporters hope will demonstrate whether nuclear microreactors can deliver on their promise of clean, resilient energy in a changing world.
