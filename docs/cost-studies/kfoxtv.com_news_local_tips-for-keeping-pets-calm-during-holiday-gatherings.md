EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — As Thanksgiving approaches, many pet owners may wonder how to keep their furry friends calm during large family gatherings. A.J. with the El Paso Human Society shared some valuable advice.
"It's important to remember that like our house and then like, you know, the walks that they take and things like that, that's kind of their entire world," A.J. said.
To prevent pets from feeling overwhelmed, A.J. suggested using gates or crates to provide a safe space for them. "If they have a crate, you know, get it set up with their favorite blankets," A.J. added. Lavender can also help calm pets, but A.J. advised ensuring it's a safe oil for animals.
"Always make sure to read the label," A.J. emphasized. These tips can help ensure a stress-free holiday for both pets and their owners.
