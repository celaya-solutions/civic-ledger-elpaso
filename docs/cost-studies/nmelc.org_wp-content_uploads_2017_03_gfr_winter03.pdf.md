The health effects of uranium have
been studied extensively over the last
100 years and uranium groundwater
standards have been steadily strength-
ened as research has revealed its
potent toxicity on the kidneys.
Epidemiological studies performed in
the last decade have shown that
ingesting water with uranium levels as low as 14 micrograms per liter
(µg/L) can lead to signs of early kidney damage. By comparison, most
drinking water sources in the U.S. and New Mexico have uranium con-
centrations below 2 µg/L.

NEW MEXICO GROUNDWATERNEEDS PROTECTION
T
he future of many high quality water sources in New Mexico
hangs in the balance as the state Water Quality Control
Commission (WQCC) considers a new—and significantly more strin-
gent—limit on uranium in groundwater affected by human activities.
As opposed to the current standard, the proposed standard is based
upon protecting human populations from this known kidney toxin.
The nuclear and uranium mining industries are expected to vigor-
ously oppose the proposed health-based standard for uranium when the
issue comes before a WQCC public hearing in April 2003. Uranium
companies lack the ability to restore aquifers after mining, and they will
see a standard that is strict enough to protect the health of the public
as a threat to their profits. 
THE NEED FOR A HEAL TH BASED URANIUM WATER
STANDARD FOR NEW MEXICO
T o protect the health of New Mexicans for generations to come, the
WQCC should adopt a uranium groundwater stan-
dard that not only reflects important developments in
recent health research, but also takes into account
conditions that are unique to our state. Foremost,
nearly 9 out of 10 New Mexicans depend on ground-
water for drinking water supplies. Additionally, cer-
tain population groups in New Mexico, such as
Native Americans, already suffer from high rates of
kidney disease, and exposure to a proven kidney toxi-
cant in water sources poses an additional and unac-
ceptable risk. People in the Crownpoint area, for
example, already have three times the national rate of
kidney disease. 
URANIUM INGESTION LEADS TO KIDNEY DAMAGE
Although uranium is radioactive and can cause cancer,
its primary toxic effect when consumed in water is
that of a heavy metal. Heavy metals, like uranium,
lead, cadmium, and arsenic, are deposited in the kid-
neys and cause irreparable damage to the chief filter-
ing mechanism of the body. The kidneys perform a
vital role by removing toxic wastes and purifying the
blood. Without dialysis, humans can live only a few
days after kidney function completely fails.

logans such as "Stop Raping
Mother Earth," "No Mine, No
Mill, No Mas," and "20 Years of

Dodge representative stated as well that a mining zone could be estab-
lished only if the land involved is not needed for commercial, residen-
tial, or other purposes. 
According to Phelps Dodge, a mining zone would be an area in
which the New Mexico standards for protection of ground water would
not apply during or after mining, and in which there would be no
requirement that a mine be reclaimed. In other words, Phelps Dodge
wants the State Legislature to create an environmental black hole, an
area in which environmental laws and regulations do not apply. The
only requirement the mining company would have to meet would be to
avoid polluting the environment outside the mining zone. 
Make no mistake about it; Phelps Dodge is proposing to create sac-
rifice zones, areas in which mining can destroy the environment and
make no effort to protect or restore it. In other words, a company like
Phelps Dodge could mine an area without being concerned about
whether the mining polluted the environment or what would happen
to the area's environment after mining was completed. The Phelps
Dodge representative who spoke at the interim legislative committee
hearing pointed out that the best place to find more ore is in an area
that has been mined, and urged that mining zones be established to
ensure that mining could be conducted in the future. According to that
reasoning, any area that had been used for mining could be set aside for
mining in the future, and no compliance with environmental standards
or reclamation would be required in that area in the future. 
Not only is this a totally inappropriate idea for areas that are mined,
it would set a terrible precedent for areas affected by other activities.
There are many activities in New Mexico that damage the land, and if
sacrifice zones can be created for mining, lobbyists for those other
activities will assert that they too are entitled to create sacrifice zones. 
Phelps Dodge's proposal is one that would be disastrous for New
Mexico. It must be defeated, and the Environmental Law Center and
its clients and allies will be working to assure that it is not enacted by
the State Legislature. 
By Douglas Meiklejohn
Executive Director
Y
ou may recall that the Phelps Dodge mining company worked
quite hard during the last session of the New Mexico
Legislature to change the New Mexico Mining Act's financial
assurance requirements. Phelps Dodge argued that it should be
allowed to provide a corporate guarantee to assure that its subsidiaries
will be able to clean up their mines even if those subsidiaries are not
available to do the necessary work. Such a guarantee would be very
risky for the taxpayers of New Mexico because Phelps Dodge and its
subsidiaries are all in the same business, mining copper. That means
that if the subsidiaries are in financial trouble because of the market
for copper, Phelps Dodge will be in similar trouble and its corporate
guarantee will not be worth the paper on which it is written. 
Phelps Dodge is likely to push for that financial assurance legisla-
tion again, and it still presents the same risks for New Mexico's envi-
ronment and its taxpayers. That proposal, however, pales by compari-
son with the other change that Phelps Dodge wants the Legislature to
make to the New Mexico Mining Act. 
T wo of the most important provisions of the Mining Act are its
requirements for compliance with environmental standards and pro-
tection of the environment during and after mining. The Act mandates
that during mining and when mines are closed, they must comply with
the state's air and water quality standards. The Act also mandates that
mines be reclaimed to self-sustaining ecosystems compatible with the
surrounding life zones. These requirements would be eliminated if
Phelps Dodge is able to persuade the Legislature to enact the changes
that it proposes to the Mining Act. 
At a recent interim legislative committee hearing, Phelps Dodge
presented its proposal for the establishment of what it termed “min-
ing zones.” According to a representative of the company, a mining
company could apply to the State government for designation of an
area as a mining zone if the area has historically been used for mining
and has mining resources that can technically and economically be
recovered. The company representative also suggested that an area
could be designated as a mining zone if that designation is necessary
to protect human health and safety and the environment. The Phelps

FROM THE DIRECTOR ’S DESK
A
ll parties are still waiting the decision of the hearing officer
from the second Chino hearing in February 2002, and the
May 20 Tyrone hearing. 
In the meantime, the New Mexico Environment Department
(NMED) has issued Notices of Violation (NOVs) to Phelps Dodge
for the Chino, Tyrone, and Continental mines. The NOVs, dated
October 18, 2002, state that Chino Mines Company, Phelps Dodge
Tyrone, Inc. and the Cobre Mining Company “did not meet the
New Mexico Mining Act Rules (Rules) deadline for obtaining
Closeout Plan approval by the Director of the Mining and Minerals
Division (MMD) in accordance with §19.10.5.501.E of the
Rules….” Already given numerous extensions to the NM Mining
Act deadline for having approved closeout plans in place, these
mining companies had been mandated to have their closeout
plans approved by the Director no later than October 1, 2002.
Phelps Dodge petitioned for review of these NOVs and requested
an expedited hearing, which was held December 13, 2002, in
front of the New Mexico Mining commission. The Commission
denied the company’s request to vacate the NOVs.
Furthermore, the New Mexico Environment Department issued
letters on August 30, 2002 “to formally confirm that the New
Mexico Environment Department (NMED) has determined
that” the Chino mine, the Tyrone mine, and the Continental
mine pose “a Hazard to Public Health, as defined in Water
Quality Control Commission (WQCC) Regulation 20.6.2.7
NMAC.” (emphasis added) Of course, Phelps Dodge appealed
this determination. Subsequently, on November 1, 2002,
NMED withdrew its August 30, 2002 letter, although it stood
by its previous implicit determination that the mines pose a
hazard to public health. Based on the withdrawal of its
August 30, 2002 letter, NMED requested that the appeal peti-
tion be vacated. Nonetheless, Phelps Dodge objected to
NMED's Notice of Withdrawal, and requested that a hearing
be set to determine 1) whether Phelps Dodge's appeal must
be dismissed based on NMED's withdrawal of the August 30
letter, and 2) if the appeal is not dismissed, whether the
mines do pose a “hazard to public health” as determined by
NMED. The WQCC ordered the copper company’s appeal dis-
missed.

US 70
O
ur client, the Valley Community Preservation Commission
(VCPC) appeared before Judge LeRoy Hansen in the New
Mexico Federal District Court on November 20, 2002 to ask for a
preliminary injunction against the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA). 
In its complaint, the VCPC and other individual plaintiffs claim
that the FHWA violated the National Environmental Protection Act
and Section 4(f) of the Department of T ransportation Act. First, it
approved the project despite conflicts of interest with the engineer-
ing firm that completed the environmental studies and was hired to
act as consultants over the project if a “build” alternative was
selected. Second, the FHWA only looked in the very narrow right-
of-way to determine whether the four-lane highway would destroy
any historical or cultural features of the Hondo Valley. The FHWA
determined there would be no negative impact, and as a result of
this narrow, illegal review, it never determined whether there was an
alternative that would minimize the impacts.
At the hearing, the VCPC argued that although the adequacy of
the FHWA's actions should be judged on the administrative
record, because the FHWA had not completed requisite impact
studies, it is necessary for the court to look at information not con-
tained in the administrative record but that demonstrates just how
much the FHWA actually neglected to take into account. 
The injunction, if granted, would have stopped the US 70
expansion project until the FHWA adequately studies the project
impacts on cultural and historical resources in the Hondo Valley.
Unfortunately, Judge Hansen denied our request for the prelimi-
nary injunction pending a trial on the merits of the case. The
VCPC is considering an appeal of the denial to the 10th Circuit
Court of Appeals.

CROWNPOINT URANIUM PROJECT
T
he HRI litigation is still on hold, pending a final attempt by the
parties to settle. The settlement judge assigned to the case has
scheduled a settlement conference for January, 2003. Should the par-
ties fail to reach a settlement, litigation before the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission will likely resume soon thereafter. 
In the meantime, ENDAUM continues to raise money for its oppo-
sition to HRI's mining projects, and is keeping pressure on elected
officials to do the right thing. 
Recently, ENDAUM had success in that regard by convincing
Senator Jeff Bingaman to remove a uranium subsidy provision from
the Senate version of the Energy Bill. That provision would have
given substantial sums of taxpayer money to companies like Uranium
Resources, Inc., HRI's parent company. Many thanks to Senator
Bingaman for his efforts in opposing this provision. 
Since Congress was unable to pass the Energy Bill during 2002, a
similar amendment in the House version (H.R. 4) that was more
explicit in its taxpayer giveawas to uranium companies did not
become law. However, we anticipate that similar uranium-subsidy lan-
guage will reemerge when Congress works on the Energy Bill during
2003. Our clients and we will remain vigilant in our efforts to defeat
this provision.

fighting the company's mill in Velarde. The members of
Vecinos have fought the mill for years, blaming respiratory
disease in the valley on the mica dust that blows from the
mill's tailings piles.
Approximately 75 people attended the protest, includ-
ing elders from Picuris and Velarde. Speakers at the mine
questioned the company's destruction of Picuris sacred
sites, as well as attempts by the mining industry to weak-
en environmental protection laws. Caravanning to the mill-
site, protestors used the venue to again draw attention to
the company's destruction of ancient cultural sites and its
disregard for its permits. 
Fortunately, for the first time in many years, NMED and
the Mining and Minerals Division are beginning to enforce
ON's permits at the two sites. The Ground Water Quality
Bureau issued a letter of non-compliance last year after dis-
covering the ground water beneath the mill site violated
ground water standards. In October, 2002, ON also received
a Notice of Violation from the Air Quality Bureau for failing
to water is stockpiles to keep fugitive emissions down at the
mill and a Notice of Violation from the Mining and Minerals
Division for illegally hauling tailings from the mill to the
mine and dumping the tailings at the mine without permis-
sion to do so. As a result of recent precipitation, the illegal
tailings piles began to erode. MMD cited ON for failure to,
among other items, minimize negative impacts to the
hydrologic balance and for failure minimize mass move-
ment. Shortly before the protest on Nov. 14, 2002, ON
withdrew its application for permit modification at the
Velarde processing mill and notified the New Mexico Mining
and Minerals Division that it would be modifying its applica-
tion for permit modification at the mine site. 
Vecinos del Rio and Picuris Pueblo experts continue to
follow the application changes ON submits. Both NMED
and MMD expect to hold hearings on new applications
sometime in the early spring.

INTEL AIR
I
n a victory for the Law Center and our client, the New Mexico
Court of Appeals has decided that the state's Environmental
Improvement Board (EIB) must better explain its decision to grant an
air quality permit to computer chip manufacturer, Intel corporation. In
2001, the SouthWest Organizing Project (SWOP), represented by the
Law Center, had appealed the EIB's Final Order of October 2000
which affirmed the air quality permit to Intel. Our client argued on
appeal that it did not receive a fair hearing from the EIB and that Intel
needs to obtain an operating permit for its air pollution. 
In its September 25, 2002 order, the Court of Appeals stated that
“[w]e cannot discern with sufficient certainty to engage in meaningful
review the substantive, procedural or evidentiary grounds relied upon
by the EIB as the basis for the EIB's Final Order.” Thus, the court
ordered that the EIB “explain in more detail the basis of its decision
including its view of the expert testimony submitted” by SWOP . 
SWOP , through the Law Center, requested a full rehearing of the
issue, arguing that the hearing officer who signed the final order is no
longer a member of the EIB and could not provide insight into matters
of credibility of the expert witness or his view of expert testimony.
The Court of Appeals denied that request for a full rehearing.
Meanwhile, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED)
has indicated that it has received funds from the EPA to conduct off-
site air monitoring downwind from the Intel plant. The results from
any monitoring, either by the State or by SWOP members or Corrales
resident, may provide data linking Intel emissions to health problems
in Corrales.

W
ith some help from the New Mexico
Solid Waste Bureau, the multinational
medical waste treatment giant, Stericycle,
Inc., has been granted a permit to modify its
solid waste treatment facility in
Albuquerque's Wells Park neighborhood. In
what is unfortunately not an unusual circum-
stance, the permit was granted despite the
fact that the application was deficient in sev-
eral respects, including the fact that
Stericycle failed to submit an adequate clo-
sure plan with its application. 
After a hearing on the permit application,
the New Mexico Environment Department
Hearing Officer found that the expert hired
by the Wells Park Neighborhood Association
(“Neighborhood Association”) and SouthWest
Organizing Project (“SWOP”) was correct in
pointing out that Stericycle did not include a
legally sufficient closure plan with its permit
application. Instead of forcing Stericycle to
re-submit a complete and thorough permit
application, the Secretary of the Environment
re-opened the record to permit Stericycle to
submit a closure plan without allowing our
clients to present expert testimony on the
closure plan or cross-examine Stericycle and
the Solid Waste Bureau's experts. 
In addition, the Hearing Officer and the

ignored Stericycle's long and sordid history of environmental, health and

that the Solid Waste Bureau did not—and felt no obligation to—consider
whether the proposed Stericycle facility expansion would have dispropor-

from more than 100 µg/L to 2 µg/L in 1998. T wo years ago, the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its first uranium drink-
ing water standard at a level of 30 µg/L. The EPA standard is higher
than the WHO standard because it was derived using both health data
and economic considerations. 
By comparison, the New Mexico groundwater-protection standard
for uranium, which was adopted by the WQCC in 1977, is an astonish-
ing 5,000 µg/L, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in-situ
leach restoration standard is 440 µg/L. Both standards are 2-3 orders of
magnitude higher than the EPA and WHO standards and the levels at
which early kidney damage may occur. TThhee  ccuurrrreenntt  NNeeww  MMeexxiiccoo  aanndd

UNM researchers based their finding on several factors, including a tox-
icological analysis of the results of recent human and animal studies of
chronic uranium ingestion and the fact people who live in arid climates
consume more water per person per day than people who live in wet
climates. The state Environment Department (NMED) is proposing
that this level supplant the existing WQCC groundwater standard of
5,000 µg/L. The NMED proposed standard of 7 µg/L appears to be a
reasonable level that protects public health and recognizes that kidney
disease is already a problem in New Mexico, while taking into account
that some groundwater in the state naturally exceeds the WHO recom-
mended standard of 2 µg/L.
THE LEGACY OF URANIUM MINING
Why is this proposed standard important? Because it will pertain prima-
rily to communities that have been, or could be, affected by uranium
mining. New Mexico contains some of the richest uranium deposits in
the world. These deposits were heavily mined during the 1950's, 60's
and 70's using conventional underground and open-pit techniques-prac-
tices that have left the land and water of the Southwest contaminated
with millions of tons of radioactive waste. Hundreds of mine-waste sites
have not been reclaimed, and many still pose a threat to local communi-
ties and water supplies.

(ISL) operations. For example, Hydro Resource Inc.'s proposed ISL
mine in Crownpoint, NM, would increase uranium water concentrations
by up 100,000 times current baseline, or background, levels. Once the
uranium is removed from the formation, the mining company must
“restore” the quality of the groundwater to the condition that existed
before mining began.
3 However, the ISL mining industry has been large-
ly unsuccessful at restoring aquifers to their native state—there is
always some uranium left behind in the water.
A review of uranium ISL operations in New Mexico, T exas, and
Wyoming has shown that it is technically difficult, if not impossible, to
restore aquifers after mining. For instance, in New Mexico, Mobil Oil
operated a pilot-scale ISL project near Crownpoint for nine months in
1979-1980, and then spent six years trying to restore the aquifer. At the
completion of restoration 19 of 29 contaminants had not been restored
to baseline; radium concentrations, for instance, exceeded the EPA
drinking water standard by nearly 12 times. 
With the high likelihood of water supplies being contaminated from
previous uranium mining and the potential for pollution from new ISL
mining in New Mexico, it is imperative that the WQCC adopt a urani-
um water standard that will safeguard our aquifers for future genera-
tions.

Dr. Fogarty is a physician who works with the Indian Health Service in

1Some, but certainly not all, areas that have significant amounts of naturally
occurring uranium have elevated levels of uranium in groundwater. For exam-
ple, some water wells in Santa Fe County have uranium concentrations above
60 µg/L. However, the Crownpoint area has rich uranium deposits but sits on a
very pure aquifer containing uranium levels less than 2 µg/L.
2A preliminary study by the EPA showed that approximately 20% of water sup-
plies in former Navajo mining communities in northeastern Arizona exceeded
federal guidelines for uranium in drinking water. Unfortunately, the quality of
water in many New Mexican mining communities has not been similarly
assessed.
3Without a stringent State standard, HRI would be allowed to restore the
aquifer to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's standard of 440 µL. This
would expose an extremely vulnerable population to a known kidney toxicant,
potentially worsening the current epidemic of kidney disease.  
Our clients represent several points of view. The Agua Fria Nursery and
Bob Pennington—the owner of Agua Fria Nursery—are losing money as
a result of Las Campanas's failure to fulfill its obligations under the
Lease between it and the City and the development's failure to comply
with the Lease provisions requiring it to share water equitably in times
of shortage. Rosemary Romero's trees, shrubs, and other landscaping
died as a result of more severe water-use restrictions put in place because
Las Campanas has used exorbitant amounts of water for its golf courses
to the detriment of the public. LURC and 1000 Friends, who also repre-
sent the community philosophy of sharing water equitably, have dedicat-
ed their missions in part to promoting water conservation and communi-
ty dialogues about water conservation. All of our clients are asking the
Court to require Las Campanas to comply with Lease provisions requir-
ing the development to share water equitably in times of shortage.

15 YEARS OF HELPING OUR NEIGHBORS PROTECT THEIR ENVIRONMENT
2002 ENVIRONMENTAL AWARDS CEREMONY
I
n the spring of 2002, Don
Goldman, a long-time support-
er of the Law Center, graciously
volunteered to author a brief
history of the Law Center. What
emerged is not just a record of
our past events, but a reflection
on the philosophy that drives
our work. We thank Don for his
excellent work, and invite you to
see the document in its entirety
at www.nmenvirolaw.org. The
following excerpt describes the
Sunland Park case, when the
Law Center shifted its focus
from public lands work to envi-
ronmental justice issues.
S
UNLAND PARK
In 1991, a fundamental change
happened when the Center was
approached by Concerned
Citizens of Sunland Park (CCSP),
a local group that was opposed
to a medical waste incinerator
close to their homes. The incin-
erator was close to two schools,
had no air pollution control
devices, emitted odors, and was
causing allergies and rashes
among members of the Sunland
Park community. The Center repre-
sented CCSP in the six-day long per-
mit hearing conducted by the State
Environment Department.
Arguments presented by the Law
Center and others caused the
department to deny the permit
sought by the company operating
the incinerator. (The Center also
represented CCSP in a separate case
on a landfill, which they lost.)
In retrospect, the Sunland Park case
was a turning point for the Center.
It revealed a major need for legal
representation and assistance
among a broad class of New
Mexicans who could not pay for it:
community and grassroots organi-
zations, pueblos, and tribes that
had valid issues against government
or industry but had no way of pre-
senting their cases in legal forums.
The well-organized conservation
groups generally had at least some
access to legal aid, and were not
so dependent on free assistance,
but the poor and grassroots
groups did not. 
role in public affairs. But all of
these great improvements were of
no avail if the citizen lacked a
lawyer to guide him through the
administrative and court proceed-
ings. Without professional help
through the legal complexities (that
government agencies and private
corporations were fully able to
handle), citizen and community
groups were no better off than had
all those changes never occurred.
Although the objectives and philos-
ophy of the Center coincided per-
fectly with the conservation organi-
zations, they also coincided with
those of the grassroots groups,
and those groups' need for free
legal aid was clearly greater. 
Filling this vacuum became the
NMELC's role. 
There was in those years the public
awakening of a new idea that came
to be known as “environmental jus-
tice,” that society and government
had no right to burden poor and
minority communities with the
industries, landfills, incinerators,
and pollution that more affluent
communities would not accept. In
fact, the 1964 Civil Rights Act and
subsequent regulations written by
the US Environmental Protection
Agency specifically prohibited envi-
ronmental injustice. The Center
would continue to support and rep-
resent conservation organizations,
but working with community
groups and Indians became the
Center's mainstay. Both the sub-
stance of the Law Center's cases
and its clientele changed. 
The opening of governments at all
levels, the new access to previously
concealed government information,
reports, decisions, and reports, and
the federal and state laws that
mandated real change, had made
something new happen: citizens
could now play an active, informed

NEWS The New Mexico

CELEBRATING FIFTEEN YEARS OF ENVIRONMENTAL VICTORIES —— 77
P
lease join us in welcoming Roderick Ventura as
the newest member of the Law Center staff.
Celebrating ten years in practice this year, Rod is
our new lead counsel on the Phelps Dodge, Intel,
LAC Minerals, and Molycorp cases.
Rod is no stranger to the Law Center; during
the late 1990s, when he worked for DNA People's
Legal Services, a legal aid office representing
Navajo citizens, Rod represented two intervenors in
the HRI proposed uranium case.
After moving to Charlotte, North Carolina, in
1999, Rod worked for the US Equal Employment
T
he Law Center
welcomes Joe
Clarke to our Board of
Directors. A partner in
the Cuddy Law Firm of
Santa Fe, Joe special-
izes in administrative
law and civil litigation
practice. He is certain-
ly no stranger to many
of the issues with
which the Law Center
deals, however, as he
served as Chief Water Referee of the Rio Grande
Basin in Colorado. He also worked closely with Law
Center Board member Frank Sanchez to help cre-
ate the Con Alma Health Foundation, the largest
private health foundation in New Mexico, which
works to serve the medically underserved and unin-
sured population of this state.
Asked why he is willing to devote his energy to
the Law Center, Joe replies that he is ready to give
something back to our community by sharing his
talents with the Law Center's Board, staff and
clients. 
One of the biggest challenges that he believes
will be on his plate as a Board member is, “the fact
that the Law Center and other environmental
organizations will be responsible for ensuring that
environmental laws are enforced, because during
the current federal administration, we can't depend
on government agencies to enforce them.” With 15
years of experience in dealing with this very phe-
nomenon, the Law Center knows Joe is right, and
looks forward to working with him on this and
other issues.
T
he Staff and Board of the New Mexico
Environmental Law Center would like to
extend their congratulations to our Board
member Mike Lilley and to Executive Director
Douglas Meiklejohn.
Mike was named Attorney of the Year by
the American Civil Liberties Union of New
Mexico for his work in defending the First
Amendment rights of two NMSU students
arrested for leafleting on campus. Because of
Mike's work, the case settled and NMSU
agreed to substantially rewrite its free
speech policy.
Doug has been busy this fall working on
the Richardson Transition Team Committee
for the New Mexico Environment
Department. As part of his duties to make
recommendations to the Governor-elect
regarding the NMED, Doug served as Chair
of the Subcommittee for the Environmental
Protection Division.
THE LAW CENTER WELCOMES NEW BOARD MEMBER
CONGRATULATIONS!
ROD VENTURA—ATTORNEY ON A MISSION
Opportunity
Commission before
moving to the private
sector. Fortunately
for us, the long
hours, low pay, lack
of humidity and com-
pelling chances to
save the world lured
him back to New Mexico and public interest
environmental law. New Mexico is also, he says, a
great place to play his accordion. Welcome, Rod!
WELCOME OUR NEW LAW CLERKS ! When T odd Lopez
(left) and Chris Lindeen, third year law students at
UNM, approached us this fall with an interest in water
law, we figured we could give them enough water-related
work to make their fingers pruney. Until May, they will
be assisting our attorneys on our HRI, Phelps Dodge,
and Las Campanas cases.

We reached the old wolf in time to watch a
fierce green fire dying in her eyes. I realized
then, and have known ever since, 
that there was something new to me in 
those eyes—something known only to 
her and to the mountain.
