A new era of advanced hair restoration in Southern New Mexico
Millennium Health & Wellness, led by Dr. Brian R. Hesser, FNP, DC, has announced a new strategic partnership with GetHairMD™, bringing some of the nation’s most advanced, non-invasive hair restoration technologies to Southern New Mexico. Through this collaboration, residents of Las Cruces and El Paso now have access to personalized, multi-modality treatment protocols previously unavailable in the region.
Hair loss affects more than 50% of men and 40% of women, often impacting self-confidence and quality of life. GetHairMD’s proprietary system combines AI-powered diagnostics, DNA-personalized treatment plans, prescription therapies, and advanced laser and at-home solutions—enabling Millennium Health & Wellness to address hair thinning and loss with precision and clinically proven success.
“Helping patients restore both function and confidence has always been at the heart of my practice,” said Dr. Hesser, founder of Millennium Health & Wellness. “Partnering with GetHairMD allows us to offer cutting-edge hair restoration with the same holistic philosophy we use in regenerative medicine, spinal decompression, and hormone optimization. We can now provide patients with real solutions that are evidence-based, non-invasive, and designed to deliver lasting results.”
Under GetHairMD’s exclusive territory model, Millennium Health & Wellness will serve as the sole provider of these advanced hair restoration protocols in southern New Mexico. Treatments offer no downtime, affordable options, and documented success rates exceeding 90%.
“Dr. Hesser’s reputation as a leader in regenerative and multidisciplinary medicine makes him an ideal partner for GetHairMD,” said Trace Herchman, President of GetHairMD. “His commitment to patient-centered care and ability to deliver innovative therapies ensures that Southern New Mexico and El Paso patients will receive the highest level of expertise and access to our most advanced solutions.”
A new era of personalized hair restoration
The treatment journey begins with AI-powered HairMetrix™ analysis, delivering precise imaging and real-time tracking of scalp health.
Next, patients undergo a genomic test to identify genetic predispositions, enabling DNA-personalized protocols. Depending on results, patients receive targeted in-clinic treatments paired with at-home systems to optimize outcomes.
Millennium Health & Wellness now offers the complete suite of GetHairMD technologies, including:
- Clinical hair growth laser: Stimulates cellular repair, increases ATP production, and boosts circulation.
- HairMetrix™ Diagnostic Imaging: AI-powered tools that guide precise treatment planning and track progress over time.
- Genomic test: Identifies genetic factors driving hair loss for individualized treatment strategies.
- Specialized prescription topicals: Custom formulations to stimulate follicles and correct underlying biological factors.
- Topical delivery device: Enhances absorption through iontophoresis technology.
- NeoSystem At-Home Regimen: A patented combination of shampoo, spray, and nutritional supplements designed to strengthen hair and support scalp health.
- LightSmart Cap: Offers UV protection with breathable, cooling comfort.
- Dual-wave energy cap: Improves circulation and supports dermal papilla health.
This multi-angle, non-invasive approach creates an optimal environment for halting hair loss, improving existing hair quality, and stimulating new growth.
Treatments require minimal disruption to daily life and can complement or even prepare patients for future surgical options if desired.
A provider with deep roots in the community
Dr. Hesser, who has practiced in Las Cruces since 1998, is uniquely positioned to lead this partnership. As a Doctor of Chiropractic Advanced Practice and Certified Family Nurse Practitioner, he is credentialed in pain management, regenerative medicine, spinal decompression, and aesthetics, including PRP and medical weight loss. His integrative, whole-body approach has helped thousands of patients avoid unnecessary surgeries and medications—an expertise he now brings to hair restoration.
With the addition of GetHairMD, Millennium Health & Wellness expands its comprehensive offerings in regenerative medicine, spinal health, functional wellness, and hormone optimization, solidifying its role as southern New Mexico’s premier destination for full-spectrum, patient-centered care.
