Exploring El Paso: ARC El Paso learns about Hanukkah Traditions
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) El Paso is aglow with the spirit of Hanukkah as the festival of lights nears its conclusion this weekend.
Rabbi Levy Greenberg of the Chabad Lubavitch Center for Jewish Life shared insights into the traditions and significance of this joyous holiday.
"We're a synagogue or a community center," said Rabbi Greenberg. "The place for Judaism for every Jew in the region."
The center, located in West El Paso, welcomes all Jews in the area to join in services, activities, and classes.
As of Friday, the community is preparing to light the sixth candle on the menorah before sunset, in observance of the Sabbath.
"Tonight, right before sundow,n we are going to be lighting the sixth candle in the menorah," Rabbi Greenberg explained.
The menorah lighting continues with seven candles on Saturday night and culminates with eight candles on Sunday, marking the final night of Hanukkah.
Rabbi Greenberg recounted the historical miracle that Hanukkah commemorates.
Over 2,000 years ago, a small group of Jews, against all odds, reclaimed their temple and found a single jar of oil to light the menorah. "By a miracle that burns for eight days and nights," he said, emphasizing the message of increasing light and goodness in the world.
The menorah, with its growing number of lit candles each night, symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness and the importance of continuously adding goodness to the world. "The message is that as we continuously add in light, we're going to have a bright and wonderful world," Rabbi Greenberg said.
Happy Hanukkah!
