What's Driving You Crazy: What happens next following road damage from a crash?
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — What happens next following road damage from a crash? That's what's driving viewers crazy this week.
A crash on I-10 near Geronimo on Sunday has raised questions about the process for addressing road damage.
The incident, which went viral on social media, involved a vehicle veering across lanes, hitting a guardrail, and knocking down a massive exit sign before catching fire on the access road.
The crash closed down the area and was cleared after 12 hours.

Officials from the Texas Department of Transportation have assessed the site and determined that a new sign will need to be installed, and guardrail repairs made.
Lauren Macias-Cervantes with TxDOT stated, "There is no estimated timeframe on replacing the sign at this point. The new sign will need to be designed, the area will be assessed for new installation, then the replacement can be scheduled."
Regarding potential closures for sign installation, TxDOT noted, "It is too soon to tell, but traffic control can vary from lane to full closures on sign installations. We are currently analyzing the location and evaluating the need for any temporary signage."
Guardrail repairs have been postponed until 2026.
