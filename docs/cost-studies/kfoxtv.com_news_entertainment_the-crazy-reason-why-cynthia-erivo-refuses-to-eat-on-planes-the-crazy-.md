The 'crazy' reason Cynthia Erivo refuses to eat anything on planes
Cynthia Erivo has revealed the “crazy” reason she refuses to eat anything while flying, and it all comes down to protecting her voice.
The “Wicked” star, 38, opened up about the strict routines she follows to keep her vocal health in tiptop shape, admitting that air travel is one situation where she takes extra precautions. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Cynthia explained that caring for her voice is a constant priority, both on and off set.
“I’m always taking care of it,” she told the outlet. “I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I’m a crazy person. I don’t eat anything on planes.” Instead, the award-winning actress packs her own essentials, including tea and water, wherever she goes.
Cynthia added that she’s rarely seen without her favorite mug, so much so that fans have turned it into a meme. “Someone made a meme of the mug that I carry around because I have it with me everywhere,” she laughed. “I have it in several different colors. I will not be without it because I want my tea to always be warm enough to hydrate me.”
While her dedication may sound extreme, Cynthia thinks it’s worth it. “I will do whatever I need to make sure she’s okay, except apparently take a break,” she joked.
The actress has also spoken about the strong bond she formed with co-star Ariana Grande, who played Galinda, while filming “Wicked.” In her book “Simply More: A Book for Anyone Who Has Been Told They’re Too Much,” Cynthia revealed the pair made a pact to protect and support one another throughout the production.
Determined to avoid the ego clashes often associated with big productions, Cynthia said their partnership was built on trust and mutual care, a synergy that carried both on and off set. We’re holding space for this dynamic duo, as well as for Cynthia’s vocal rituals that gave us the iconic “Wicked” riff battle cry.
