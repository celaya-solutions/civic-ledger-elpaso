Nutritionist shares protein-packed tips to supercharge your Thanksgiving feast
If you're watching your calories this holiday season, there are a few tips you might want to take note of when preparing a festive feast.
Rachel Swanson, MS, RD, LDN, who is a registered dietitian and founder of the nutrition consulting practice Diet Doctors, LLC, said there are plenty of ways to reduce carbohydrates and boost your protein intake.
For Thanksgiving, the centerpiece is usually turkey, which is packed with protein. But Swanson suggested adding other protein options to the table.
A contrasting protein naturally trims carb portions on the plate," Swanson, who counsels celebrities, models, C-suite executives, professional athletes and physicians as the Nutrition Director for LifeSpan Medicine, said in a news release sent to The National News Desk. "Try a citrus-herb salmon side or miso-roasted tofu steaks -- both pair perfectly with Thanksgiving flavors."
Swanson said it's a good idea to avoid gobbling up appetizers that are loaded with refined carbs. Instead, she said to serve roasted, spiced chickpeas or baked white beans with walnuts or macadamias to front-load protein and fiber.
As for side dishes like mashed potatoes and stuffing, she said there are simple ways to increase the protein.
One is to make Greek-style mashed potatoes by folding in Greek yogurt or skyr for "a silkier texture, tang, and a meaningful protein lift." For stuffing, she said to keep the classic bread base, but add diced chicken or turkey, white beans, and toasted nuts for crunch.
You’ll get the same savory comfort with more protein," she said.
Swanson also recommended to plate protein and vegetables first, and eat those portions before the starches.
This sequence helps steady blood sugar and creates a gentle 'mesh' in the stomach (protein and fiber slows digestion), so smaller carb portions still feel satisfying," she said.
And then there's dessert.
Swanson said skip the pie and instead indulge by sipping herbal protein tea.
If you’re battling 'round two' dessert cravings, brew a post-dinner ginger–turmeric chai and whisk in vanilla collagen powder," she said. "Serve in mugs with a cinnamon dusting -- cozy, lightly sweet, and protein-boosted."
