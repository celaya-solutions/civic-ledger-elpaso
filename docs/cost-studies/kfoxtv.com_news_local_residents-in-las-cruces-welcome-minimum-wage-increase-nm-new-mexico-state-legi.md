Las Cruces residents weigh in on minimum wage increase
LAS CRUCES, N.M. (KFOX14/CBS4) — Las Cruces is set to see another increase in its minimum wage, which will rise from $12.65 to $13.01 an hour starting Jan. 1.
This change is part of a city ordinance initiated in 2014, which established annual increases from 2015 to 2019.
In 2020, the New Mexico State Legislature enacted the Minimum Wage Act, extending similar increases statewide.

Frank Jaurequi, owner of Downtown Blues Coffee, expressed support for the wage hike.
"I don't know what it's like to pay an employee, but I think it's a great idea. Here's a hike. Another hike is good," Jaurequi said.
Jaurequi emphasized the importance of supporting small businesses, which he described as "the backbone of America."
The city's wage increase is based on the Consumer Price Index, which measures the national average cost of living.
Las Cruces has adopted its own minimum wage since 2023, with a calculated CPI higher than the state's increase.
An unnamed resident noted the challenges business owners face with such increases.
"When this same stuff comes up, it's hard for them. So, especially if they have clients, security work maybe, they have to increase their rates to their clients as well," the resident said.
Despite these challenges, the resident acknowledged the benefits, stating, "It's a great thing because it's going to help."
