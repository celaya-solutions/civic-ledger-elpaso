Political dynasties: New generation of candidates emerge in US elections
WASHINGTON (TNND) — Political dynasties are making a resurgence as a new generation of candidates with famous family names enters the political arena.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., currently serving as health secretary in a Republican administration, continues the Kennedy legacy in Washington. His cousin, Jack Schlossberg, JFK's grandson, is running for Congress in New York as a Democrat. Schlossberg has been a frequent critic of RFK, Jr. and the Trump administration.
"I'm running for office because 250 years after our country was founded, we're in a crisis unlike we've seen before," Schlossberg told MS Now while making his announcement.
Meanwhile, another name with a presidential bloodline, Jonathan Bush, nephew of George H.W. Bush and cousin to George W. Bush, is vying for the governorship in Maine.
"We bought a poll and had the fancy pollster come and ask and one of the questions was what do you think of the Bushes and in Maine, 70% of likely voters like the Bushes," Bush told his brother, Billy, on his podcast.
In California, Christine Pelosi, daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is seeking a state Senate seat. In New Hampshire, Stefany Shaheen, daughter of retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, aims for a congressional seat.
Arizona's Adelita Grijalva has already demonstrated the power of name recognition, winning a special election to succeed her late father, Raul Grijalva, in Congress. The question remains: will these political legacies translate into electoral victories?
