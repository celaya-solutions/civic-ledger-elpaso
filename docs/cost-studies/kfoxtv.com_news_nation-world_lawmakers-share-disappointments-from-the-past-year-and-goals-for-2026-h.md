Lawmakers share disappointments from the past year and goals for 2026
WASHINGTON (TNND) — On Capitol Hill, the end of the year scramble left some lawmakers reminiscing about what might have been.
In interviews with The National News Desk, they shared their thoughts:
“My greatest disappointment by far was the spending in the deficit. It’s still growing. The debt is still at $38 trillion. It’s so large," said Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas.
2025 marked a year of fiery debates over who should pay the highest taxes and who should get a break, not to mention what to do about healthcare, all in a political climate with temperatures sometimes boiling over.
"My biggest disappointment was the fact that the left has brought back this poisonous ideology into our body politic," said Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif.
“We've descended into a very vicious partisan age and Trump leads that. He’s calling Somali’s garbage and constantly insulting his political adversaries. What the hell is that? We’re supposed to be working on policy here," remarked Rep. Adam Smith, D- Wash.
As far as policy that may dominate in 2026?
Much of it is expected to center on the economy and how Americans think the government should assist.
Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., talked about her priorities for the new year.
"It’s going to be lowering costs for families, healthcare costs, making sure we are focused on families and small businesses who need access to healthcare," she said.
Those plans, however, could collide with alternative ambitions.
"I hope we come closer to fiscal responsibility. I hope we can begin to control our federal budget, just like our states control their state budgets," said Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md.
Those grand goals for the future exist alongside ones that are a little simpler.
"What do I hope Congress accomplishes next year? I mean, the basics. Let’s pass appropriations bills on time," Smith said.
While the first several months of 2025 were dominated by Republicans passing President Donald Trump’s top priorities into law, 2026 could look a little different.
One reason for that is the pressure of the midterm elections in November.
Additionally, lawmakers will hear from voters about how they think their representatives in Washington have served them, which could play a much more significant role in determining what comes up on the floor for a vote.
