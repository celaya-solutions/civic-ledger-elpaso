Nick Shirley defends his childcare fraud claims amid scrutiny of viral video
(TNND) — Nick Shirley, the young independent journalist behind a viral video exposing what he alleges are bogus childcare centers stealing government money in Minnesota, defended his efforts in a CNN interview and pulled back the curtain on his probe during an appearance on the PBD Podcast.
Shirley’s video has accumulated 3 million views in a week on YouTube and 135 million views on X.
The video has been amplified by both Vice President JD Vance and billionaire Elon Musk, the former head of the Department of Government Efficiency.
In the video, Shirley and a man identified only as “David” go to various places they say are Somali-run childcare centers that are scamming the government out of millions of dollars without actually serving any children.
Shirley’s video has been acknowledged by federal officials and, at least in part, prompted Health and Human Services to freeze childcare payments to Minnesota to root out fraud in the state.
Attorney General Pam Bondi applauded Shirley’s video and said the Justice Department has been investigating fraud claims in Minnesota for months. Bondi said they’ve charged 98 people, 85 of Somali descent, and more than 60 have been found guilty in court.
FBI Director Kash Patel said via social media that the fraud that’s been exposed so far “is just the tip of a very large iceberg. We will continue to follow the money and protect children, and this investigation very much remains ongoing.”
But Shirley told host Patrick Bet-David on the PBD Podcast that the FBI hasn’t reached out to him following his video.
“There's people who are wondering how I got my information from the government, and I've been willing to say like, ‘Yeah, I got it from David. If you want to talk to David, here's David's contact info.’ But I don't know how the government doesn't have all this information,” Shirley said on the podcast. “It's kind of like surprising to me.”
Shirley said local journalists in Minnesota have been talking about the fraud, or alleged fraud, for years. Now, the story is reaching a national audience.
Shirley said the man he teamed up with, David, had compiled documentation of alleged fraud through years of investigation.
“David messaged me on Instagram, and out of the hundreds of DMs I get, I just opened David's, and he had all the proof,” he said on the podcast. “Because I've known about the fraud happening for so long in Minnesota since back in June. I've known about the fraud, but it's hard for me to go out and get all the information, because they make it very hard to get the information. Luckily, David had somebody inside the capital who has been leaking him all the numbers, leaking him all the information.”
The claims made in Shirley’s video come amid ongoing formal fraud probes in Minnesota.
Authorities say fraudsters have claimed billions of federal dollars, taking money meant to care for children and other vulnerable citizens.
First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson said during a Dec. 18 news conference that the state had flagged 14 high-risk Medicaid programs, suspended payments for those programs and ordered a third-party audit.
Thompson said those 14 programs in Minnesota have cost $18 billion since 2018, and he said there’s reason to believe that more than half of that amount was fraudulent.
Even though high-ranking officials within the Trump administration have given Shirley kudos for his work, federal law enforcement officials haven’t corroborated Shirley’s claims in the video.
A CNN reporter interviewed Shirley in the field earlier this week, asking him how he knew his claims were valid.
“How do I know that they're true?” he responded to CNN correspondent Whitney Wild. “Well, ... we showed you guys what was happening, and then you guys can go ahead and make your own analysis.”
Shirley told CNN that he uncovered around $100 million in fraud in one day.
Shirley said he encountered locked childcare centers with blacked-out windows and no kids around.
Skeptics of Shirley’s claims have said childcare centers are locked for safety, and they question whether he visited during normal operating hours.
Shirley told CNN that he went about 11 a.m. one day to a childcare center and “later” the next.
“The point of it is not whether or not I came at the right, at the right time of their operation hours,” he told CNN. “The point is that blacked-out doors. They can't give you any information. You call that number? No one answers.”
Shirley noted on the PBD Podcast that one of the childcare centers he visited had a sign that they were open 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week, yet no kids were seen when he arrived.
Shirley told Bet-David that two childcare businesses operating within that same building had combined to pull in over $5 million in government money, citing their documents.
Wild was seen in the CNN story calling some of the childcare centers featured in Shirley’s video. She said only one answered.
Children were seen entering a daycare on the day CNN cameras were out there. Shirley claimed the daycare was simply “showing face” following his initial video.
Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and other conservative commentators have criticized CNN’s questioning of Shirley.
Cruz said via social media that the CNN reporter was “doing everything she can to defend the Somali fraudsters.”
Shirley himself called the CNN story a “hit piece.”
“The lady came up to me very friendly, and then she kept asking me these questions,” he said on the PBD Podcast. “I'm like, ‘Ma'am, you're, you're defending fraud. Like, what are you talking about?’”
