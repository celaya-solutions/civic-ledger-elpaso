What's Driving You Crazy: School traffic congestion frustrates El Paso drivers
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — School traffic blocks roadways during student drop-off. That's what's driving one viewer crazy this week.
A viewer contacted KFOX14, stating in part, "Harmony school on Joe Battle is blocking 1 lane of Joe Battle ---There is no need to block traffic on a busy 2 lane road when all the school has to do is open either of 2 gates to allow parents to exit the school. One in Amesbury and the other on Addison."
In response to these concerns, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) clarified that school locations are determined by local zoning authorities, not TxDOT.
Harmony Public Schools stated that their traffic plan, reviewed and approved by TxDOT, includes a staggered drop-off and dismissal schedule to reduce congestion. The school also collaborates with the El Paso County Sheriff's Office to manage vehicle flow on Joe Battle Blvd.
