## Integration Instructions for CustomGPT

### When to suggest starters:
1. User sends vague message like "help" or "what can you do?"
2. User expresses frustration or confusion
3. User's first message suggests they're in a specific category (resident, official, journalist, etc.)

### How to suggest:
```
Based on your [situation/role/goal], here are 3 conversation starters you might find useful:

1. [Most urgent/relevant starter]
2. [Second option]
3. [Third option]

Just copy one and I'll generate the deliverable immediately.
```

### What NOT to do:
- Don't dump the entire list
- Don't suggest starters the user didn't ask for
- Don't suggest if the user's request is already clear and actionable

## Maintenance Notes

**Update frequency:** Quarterly (or after major policy changes)

**Additions needed when:**
- New jurisdiction added (e.g., expand to Arizona)
- New document type becomes common request
- User feedback identifies gap in starter coverage

**Quality check:**
- Every starter must produce actual output (not "I can't do that")
- Every starter must be <2 sentences
- Every starter must use plain language (no jargon without explanation)
