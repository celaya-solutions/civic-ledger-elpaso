Law Center 
members ensured
that community
groups were able to
challenge the Martinez
Administration over
a critical test of 
public participation.
On July 22, the
Multicultural
Alliance for a Safe
Environment (MASE)
and Amigos Bravos
took the Mining and
Minerals Division
(MMD) and the
Mining Commission
to district court
over the agencies’
failures to provide 
opportunties for
meaningful public
participation in mine permitting proceed-
ings. Our clients walked away from the
courthouse with a stunning victory– one
that sends the message to the Governor
(once again) that her Administration is
not above the law. After the hearing we
were able to sit down with Law Center
Staff Attorney Eric Jantz for a quick
catch-up on the case.
Can you provide a little background
on the Mount T aylor Mine case? 
Eric: The Mt.Taylor uranium mine 
operated intermittently in the 1970s and
1980s. In 1992, it stopped production
because the uranium market tanked.
After the New Mexico Mining Act
passed in 1993, the Mt. Taylor Mine
obtained a mining permit, which it
[ continued on pg 2]
almost immediately revised to allow it
to go on “standby 
status”. In 2010, Rio
Grande Resources applied for the mine’s
fourth standby permit. Under the
Martinez Administration, MMD and
the Commission took every opportunity
to cut our clients out of the process.
MASE and Amigos Bravos were not
allowed to introduce important ecological
testimony at a public hearing, and were
told that it was outside the scope of the
permit. They were barred from ques-
tioning the company’s reclamation
bond – in fact, MMD decided to review
the company’s bond afterit renewed the
permit, and has yet to receive public
input. Finally, our clients were not able
to review an economic viability analysis
that is supposed to provide evidence that
the uranium market
would be robust
enough for the mine
to reopen in 2014.
After the agencies
renewed the stand-
by permit, we took
them to court.
What was the ruling?
Eric: Judge Raymond
Ortiz of Santa Fe
District Court ruled
that the agencies
failed to provide
opportunities for
effective public 
participation in the
Mt. Taylor proceed-
ing. Because of this
ruling, MMD will
have to hold new
hearings on environmental safeguards,
financial assurance, and economic viability
for the Mt. Taylor Mine. It is an important
ruling for the people in our state.
The ruling affects a permit for a mine
near Grants. Why is the decision
important for all New Mexicans? 
Eric: Basically, the judge ruled that the
provisions of the New Mexico Mining

Act that provide for transparency, accountability, and public
participation are meaningful. It is unacceptable for the
agencies to interpret those provisions so narrowly as to 
render them meaningless.
Thus the agency – and indeed, the Administration – is 
on notice that it cannot treat the public as a nuisance to be
tolerated. Under the Mining Act, it must take into account
our questions, concerns and grievances. I imagine that this
ruling will impress upon other agencies like the New Mexico
Environment Department that they should not try to
dodge requirements for public participation.
What’s next?
Eric: Rio Grande Resources filed an application earlier 
this year to take the mine to “active” rather than “standby”
status. We have requested a hearing on that permit applica-
tion, and anticipate that will happen this fall. With Judge
Ortiz’s ruling, we know that our clients will be afforded
much better opportunities to participate in that process.
Anything else to add? 
Eric: We are up against some major players in this case.
Not only are we opposed by the New Mexico Mining
Commission and MMD, but the Mt. Taylor Mine is operated
by Rio Grande Resources, which is a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary of General Atomics (a global defense contractor). 
I would like to thank our supporters for making sure 
that the Law Center was there when communities near Mt.
Taylor needed legal representation. In a perfect world, we
could trust our government and corporations to do the right
thing. In the real world, we rely on your help to make sure
that decision-makers are held accountable for their actions.
Thank you again, and we will keep you apprised of what
happens in this case and in others that affect Mt. Taylor.

Some issues our members are supporting this summer:
Water Grabs:Stopping Italian billionaire Bruno Modena, who seeks 
to grab 54,000 acre-feet of water near Datil – enough to supply a city 
of 500,000 annually.
Uranium: Winning protections for residents who live near the
Homestake uranium millsite. They face a cancer risk 18 times higher 
than that considered acceptable by EPA. 
Oil & Gas:The State just weakened the Pit Rule – including a new 
provision that allows for multi-acre “frack lakes”.The Law Center
appealed in early August.
More information on these cases can be found at nmelc.org, or 
please call us at (505) 989-9022.
Member support translates into
legal defense for New Mexico
communities in more than
40 cases right now.
Law Center supporters are leading the charge
against State policies and regulations that
promote the contamination of our precious water
resources. Today, that work is more important
than ever: in the summer of 2013 Elephant Butte
Reservoir, New Mexico’s largest reservoir,
dwindled to its lowest level in forty years,
about 3 percent of the reservoir’s capacity.

Case Updates
Twenty Five Years of Environmental and Community Victories3
Oil & Gas Pit Rule:    
In June, the Martinez Administration gutted the “Pit Rule,” which 
governs the storage and disposal of toxic oil and gas drilling
wastes. The Oil Conservation Commission removed nearly
all of its stringent provisions, including setbacks to
homes and wells and requirements for closed-loop 
systems where pits are near water resources. It also
added a provision that allows for“frack lakes” – multi-
well, multi-acre pits that hold toxic drilling wastes.
Member support ensured that Attorney Eric Jantz could
build a strong case for appeal during the rulemaking, and
that he could file that appeal in district court in August 2013.
Homestake Uranium Mill:     
Attorney Jon Block represents members of the Bluewater 
Valley Downstream Alliance, most of whom live in the 
shadow of the Homestake uranium mill Superfund site. 
A recent draft report by the Environmental Protection
Agency shows that residents near the mill face a cancer 
risk 18 times higher than that considered acceptable by 
the EPA. Jon and his clients continue to advocate to EPA 
Region 6 that the site be cleaned up.
Aquifer Science Water Appropriation 
In this major water case, Aquifer Science, LLC seeks a 700 acre- 
foot appropriation near Sandia Park. Although the State 
Engineer has stated that the basin has been over 
appropriated since the 1980s, it now appears to be 
endorsing the company’s application. In June we finished
a weeks-long trial before the State Engineer, and anticipate 
a decision on the company’s application this fall.

After nearly two years, the New Mexico
Court of Appeals handed down a victory
in our case against the Administration’s
illegal repeal of energy conservation codes.
The Court ruled on only one of our issues:
that the Commissioners could not repeal
the codes without giving reasons for their
action.  (The repealed Codes sought to
reduce energy usage by new construction
by 20%) The victory was short-lived: the
Commission has held a new vote and issued
a Statement of Reasons for adopting weaker
regulations. We filed a new appeal shortly
after the Commission held its new vote.
But it was another message to the
Martinez Administration that it cannot
circumvent the law.
“It is well established that agencies must
provide the reasoning for their decisions,
but the Commission’s only effort to do so
came after we filed our appeal,” says
Doug Meiklejohn, Law Center Executive
Director and lead counsel on this case.
“Once again a court has had to explain to
the Administration that the law applies 
to everyone.”
Doug represents Southwest Energy
Efficiency Project (SWEEP), Sundancer
Creations, eSolved, Inc., Environment 
New Mexico, and several individuals.
Thank you for 
helping us win the 
first EnergyConservation
Codes case!

Case Updates
How you’re standing up to one of the
worst proposed regulations (ever)
NMED inexplicably fights on behalf of Big Copper for
right to pollute public water
As an agency tasked with protecting water quality in our state, you would hope
that the New Mexico Environment Department would, well, work to protect
water quality. Here’s just one example of how it’s not: it is pushing for a “Copper
Rule” that would circumvent our state’s key water quality law and allow massive
contamination of groundwater.
Fortunately, as a Law Center member, you’re standing up to this travesty.
You’re supporting an epic legal battle in what is one of the most significant water
cases in New Mexico history. 
Here are some of the provisions sought by NMED and copper giant Freeport
McMoRan: 
• Exempt every New Mexico copper mine (now and in the future) from the NM
Water Quality Act.
• Remove common sense pollution prevention measures, such as liners beneath
acid-producing waste rock piles. (Liners help to intercept toxins before they can
reach groundwater.)
• Eliminate comprehensive monitoring and reporting requirements, so as to hobble
the ability of regulators and citizens to know where (and how much) pollution is
occurring, and where it’s heading. Going up against a state agency and the largest
publicly-traded copper company in the world, Law Center members ensured
that our public water had strong representation during the month-long hearing.
We await a decision on the Rule by the Water Quality Control Commission.
Staff Attorney Bruce Frederick worked with co-counsel Tracy Hughes (High Desert
Energy + Environment Law Partners) to represent Amigos Bravos and the Gila
Resources Information Project – two of our state’s most experienced advocates when
it comes to protecting water near hardrock mines. You can find out more about the
seamy underbelly of this case in Laura Paskus’ “The Canary in the Copper Mine 
(is Dead): How New Mexico’s Copper Industry Wrote its own Rules,” an exposé 
in the Santa Fe Reporter dated May 14, 2013. 
In a situation that has the potential to
set national precedent, the New Mexico
Environmental Law Center has signed
on to help Mora County uphold its ban
on oil and gas drilling in the event it is
challenged in court.
"This really is the most unadulterated
form of democracy that there is," Eric
Jantz said of the county's ordinance.
"This is communities taking control and
making decisions about their future."
Eric is working with the Community
Environmental Legal Defense Fund in
this case.
NMELC to represent
Mora County in any
upcoming fight over
fracking 
“I don’t think that I could possibly
overstate the negative impacts these
rules could have on the communities
near where I live.
...I think these rules might allow the
same kind of pollution at new mines in
different communities that they have –
that these existing mines have already
created, and that seems to me to be a
shame because we should learn from
our past mistakes.
Also, I think they set a very dangerous
precedent for other industries, as [former
NM Groundwater Bureau Chief Bill]
Olson has been very clear about. I think
of water as a lifeblood of our state.
I think it's precious. I think we should
protect it. I think the integrity of this
Water Quality Commission and the
Environment Department are at stake if
you actually approve these regulations
as written. I truly believe that.”
– Sally Smith, Grant County resident, Gila
Resources Information Project Board Member,
and long-time Law Center client. From her 
testimony on the Copper Rule.

Gene Simon’s support lives on
inbequest
Mr. Gene Simon, a longtime newspaperman and later a
rancher in Faywood, NM, began his support of the Law
Center when we were still a one-attorney shop, back in
1990. It was always a pleasure to get his notes of 
encouragement, which were promptly thumb-tacked to our bulletin board.
Gene passed away in 2012, at the age of 96, and left the Law Center a bequest in his will.
His final gift will enable us to provide hundreds of hours of pro bono legal assistance on
dozens of cases across the state, and to continue our work to hold our elected officials
accountable for their actions. We are very grateful to him for including us in his legacy .
Bequests and other planned gifts play a critical role in ensuring that the New Mexico
Environmental Law Center can continue fighting on your behalf for cleaner water, safer air,
and protected lands for years to come. Every gift makes a difference, no matter how big or
small. For information on ways to include the Law Center in your estate plans, please contact
Elizabeth Lee at (505) 989-9022, ext 18, or elee@nmelc.org. Thank you.
