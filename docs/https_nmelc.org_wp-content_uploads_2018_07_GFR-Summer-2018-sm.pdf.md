Rio Grande Riverbed
In our May 1990 Green Fire Report, we wrote,
“New Mexico is rich in natural resources. Water, however, is a scarce resource in this state. The 
water we have is essential. Nine out of ten New Mexicans depend on underground supplies for their 
drinking water. Water quantity and quality are critical to our public health and environment.”
This statement is as true today as it was 28 years ago, but we take up the responsibility to protect this most 
precious resource with more urgency than ever before.
David Gutzler, a professor at UNM and an internationally respected expert on the impacts of climate change 
in New Mexico and the Southwest, testiﬁ  ed earlier this year for the Law Center in our Aquifer Science water 
speculation case in Albuquerque’s East Mountains. His conclusion was bleak. Rising temperatures, shrinking 
snow packs, and an expanding population indicate that access to clean water may be the greatest challenge 
facing New Mexico in the coming decades.

Water: Our Irreplaceable Resource
Anyone who lives in New Mexico knows that the state has serious water problems. The 
most obvious problem is that there is not enough water. Less obvious, at least to a casual 
observer, is pollution of surface water. Even less obvious, because it occurs underground, 
is the mining and pollution of groundwater. However, the most insidious and serious 
problem of all may be the refusal of political decision makers to take into account what it 
really means to live in an arid state.
 
New Mexico had a record low snowpack this year, which translates to very low runoff into 
our rivers. The Rio Grande south of Socorro began drying up several months early and 
predictions are that 120 miles of it will be dry this summer, including possibly the parts 
of the river in the Albuquerque area. Global warming is making these shortages of surface water the “new normal”.
 
Water that cannot be used because it is contaminated also diminishes our supplies. Sometimes, water pollution is 
obvious as in the case of the spill from the Gold King Mine in Colorado that turned the Animas River bright orange. 
In many cases, pollution is not so obvious. Many of our rivers are brown with sediment, but the real problem is the 
industrial metals and PCBs attached to the sediments, along with bacteria and excess nutrients from animal waste and 
leaking septic systems.
 
Groundwater today is the source of drinking water for the vast majority of New Mexicans, with the amount of ground-
water pumping set to expand rapidly in the coming decades. New Mexico therefore must treat its groundwater as the 
irreplaceable resource that it is. Unfortunately, the state is doing exactly the opposite. First, New Mexico’s groundwater 
resources are being mined; they are being extracted at rates faster than they are recharged. Second, large amounts of 
groundwater have already been polluted by copper, uranium, and molybdenum mines, the national nuclear laborato-
ries, and Kirtland Air Force Base. Once groundwater is polluted, it is very difficult and expensive to clean.
 
Surface and groundwater are inextricably linked. Inadequate irrigation water from the Rio Grande led to greatly 
increased groundwater pumping in the southern part of the state. This lowered the water table near the river, causing 
the river to lose water that Texas claims it is owed under the Rio Grande Compact. Texas has sued New Mexico in the 
US Supreme Court and was recently joined by the federal government. Early indications are that the case is not going 
well for New Mexico. If the state loses, it may have to provide massive monetary compensation and more water to Texas 
to make up for past delivery shortages. This would be disastrous for New Mexico.
 
Despite all of these issues, New Mexico’s political decision makers continue to act as if the state has water resources to 
spare. The Martinez administration Copper Rule authorizes copper mines to pollute the groundwater in the “capture 
zones” created by their open pit mines; the “capture zone” at one of the largest mines in Grant County covers about nine 
square miles. The developers of the proposed Santolina development on the west side of Albuquerque have violated 
the requirement to identify where the water for this development would come from. Nevertheless, the majority of the 
Bernalillo County Board of County Commissioners has approved it at every step of the process. The Mt Taylor uranium 
mine has not produced since 1990 and has contaminated groundwater. Rather than being forced into reclamation, the 
state has given the mine operator a permit to return to “active” status. In addition, the Mining and Minerals Division 
acknowledges that at least half of all known abandoned uranium mines in New Mexico have never had any reclamation 
work done on them.
 
These approaches must change. New Mexico does not have unlimited amounts of water, and the amounts of surface 
and groundwater available to New Mexicans will continue to decrease as global warming continues. Unless New 
Mexico’s elected decision makers recognize these facts, the state’s water woes will continue to increase.
 Yours truly,

The Law Center is blessed to have the most interesting, educated and compassionate  
donors in all New Mexico, and Helenty Homans is no exception. 
At age 92, she’s been a few places, seen a few things, and developed a few ideas. 
She grew up in Prague until the age of 12, when her family emigrated in 1938.  
After some time in Canada, they ended up in Boston. There, Helenty (whose given  
name is Helen) met a New Mexican named Mary Riseley (also a Law Center supporter).  
When Mary returned to New Mexico, she and Helenty stayed in touch, and after 
four years Helenty found herself in Colorado and took the opportunity to visit Mary.  
As is true with so many New Mexican stories, Helenty “just loved the place” , she recalls. “It reminded me of Europe. ”  
Helenty went back to Boston to get her dog, and returned to the Santa Fe area where she found several house-sitting gigs. 
Eventually, she bought a house on four acres north of town in Jacona – where she lives to this day. (Her daughter Dee – also 
a Law Center supporter – and her son Rick lived in Albuquerque’s South Valley for a time before moving to Tampa, FL.) 
“There have been so many changes” since buying her home 45 years ago, Helenty notes. “I wanted to give something back” 
and preserve something of the community. So she gave her four-acre property to the Santa Fe Community Housing Trust. 
Now Helelnty’s home is joined by three other affordable family homes on two acres of the property. The other two acres 
are devoted to small-scale farming – handled by Mr. G., who sells his produce at the weekly Santa Fe Farmers Market. 
Helenty has four charitable giving priorities: animal causes; affordable housing; small-scale farming and environmen-
talism. She has been a supporter of the Law Center’s environmental justice work since 1991 – giving through a donor- 
advised fund in her name at the Santa Fe Community Foundation – and has a particular interest in the impacts of  
mining on the environment and communities in New Mexico. She also is concerned about contamination from activities at 
the Los Alamos National Laboratory. We are honored to have Helenty’s loyal support as we fight on these important fronts.  
Thank you, Helenty!

DONOR SPOTLIGHT - Helenty Homans

We came to Datil in 1996, after look-
ing for a retirement home throughout 
the west. After 28 years in southern 
California, it seemed the time to move 
to a quieter place with less commotion. 
Besides, living in a rural area would be 
an adventure.
 
Our location in the Datil mountains is 
one of the most beautiful places in the 
country. The Plains of San Augustin 
seem to ﬂ  ow endlessly below the dis-
tant mountains that surround them, the 
sky arching overhead. This is ranching 
country with large spreads around us, 
the open land serene and quiet. Several 
generations of families have lived and 
ranched the land and these families 
have a dedication to this way of life. 
Those who, like ourselves, are new-
comers to this rural community, share 
in that love of this place.
 
“El agua es la vida.”
That dedication shows up in the ﬁ  ght to save the Augustin Plains aquifer. Going on 11 years, this community, which 
includes those of us who are not ranchers as well as those who are, has fought an attempt to mine the waters of the 
basin that sustains us. A corporate entity has applied to take 54,000 acre feet of water each year from the basin and send 
it via pipeline to Albuquerque. That application threatens the community, the economy, the culture and our very lives 
should it be approved. We are ﬁ  ghting to maintain our adopted community, knowing that this land could sustain us 
and our families forever.
 
El agua es la vida. The stakes are high, and should this application to mine water here be approved, all of New Mexico’s 
rural communities will be threatened by the precedent it will set. We will live or die on the decision of the State 
Engineer, so serious is this threat to our well-being. Perhaps we should all ask: is this a decision that one man should 
make? Shouldn’t we ourselves have a say in the future of our communities? We would like to think that is possible.
 
Editor’s note: The Law Center represents Ray & Carol Pittman and approximately 80 other residents in this decade-long ﬁ  ght.

Charles de Saillan, Staff Attorney 
Charles de Saillan started work with the Law Center on June 4, 2018. He joins us from the 
New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, where he worked for over 4 years. Before moving 
to New Mexico, Charlie worked at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice De-
partment in Washington, D.C., handling enforcement litigation under the Clean Water Act, 
the Safe Drinking Water Act, and federal hazardous waste laws.
Charlie moved to New Mexico in 1993 to work for Attorney General Tom Udall. He helped 
develop the state’s natural resource damage program and led a national attorney general work 
group to retain strong liability and cleanup provisions in the Superfund program. In 1999, 
Charlie moved to the Environment Department where he worked on enforcement and per-
mitting actions involving hard rock mines, petroleum refi  neries, electric power plants, and 
the nuclear weapons laboratories. Notably, he negotiated the 2005 Consent Order for comprehensive investigation and cleanup 
of pollution at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Charlie holds a Bachelor of Arts from Boston University, a Juris Doctor from Boston University School of Law, and an LL.M. 
in Energy and Environmental Law from Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven, Belgium. He has numerous publications in the fi  eld 
of environmental law. Charlie enjoys many outdoor activities and is a photographer. For several years he was a volunteer with 
St. John’s College and Atalaya search and rescue teams. He is on the Board of Conservation Voters New Mexico, and Conser-
vation Voters N.M. Education Fund.
Nadine Padilla, Law Fellow 
Nadine Padilla just graduated from UNM Law School, and will join the Law Center staff   on Septem-
ber 4th to begin a two-year fellowship funded primarily by the Kellogg Foundation.
Nadine, who is Navajo and Pueblo (Isleta/Laguna) from Bluewater Lake, NM, has a unique under-
standing of and sensitivity to the many complexities involved in addressing environmental concerns 
of Indigenous communities.
Before law school, Nadine worked with the Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment (one of 
our clients) to protect Mt. Taylor, a mountain sacred to her community, from proposed uranium 
mining. Nadine has one son, Noah (4 yo), and they love to read, swim, do puzzles, and go for walks 
together. She was Editor-in-Chief for the Natural Resources Journal, a writing tutor for fi  rst year law 
students, a volunteer with the Native American Law Student Association, and a Teaching Assistant 
for the Pre-Law Summer Institute program. Nadine received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Fort Lewis College in Durango, 
Colorado, and her Master’s in Communication from Gonzaga University.
Kendra Palmer, Paralegal
Kendra Palmer is a certifi  ed paralegal with a passion for environmental protection in New 
Mexico. She comes to us from a similar position with the First Judicial District Court in Santa 
Fe, where she worked for almost eight years. Prior to that, Kendra worked as a paralegal for a 
law offi   ce in Austin, Texas.
In her free time, Kendra enjoys camping, hiking, photography, small-scale urban farming, 
music, and sewing. Kendra is currently attending the Santa Fe Community College and will 
graduate this summer with a Certifi  cate in Paralegal Studies. She will begin work at the Law 
Center in mid-July.

 
In the years after its founding in 1987, most of the Law Center’s cases dealt with land habitat con-
servation. However, by the early 90’s, the Center’s mission began to shift to environmental justice 
as it became clear that New Mexico’s communities desperately needed accessible and responsible 
legal representation to deal with environmental and public health harms. Minority, rural, and 
low-income communities are most likely to suff  er the eff  ects of contamination; they are also the 
most likely to be targeted in water grabs by high-proﬁ  le private interests that threaten future pub-
lic supplies, and are often the ﬁ  rst to experience conﬂ  ict around who owns and controls the rights 
to water in our state. They are also likely to suff  er most from climate change impacts.
Many of the battles we are ﬁ  ghting today date back years and even decades. In 1988, the Law 
Center took on its ﬁ  rst water case, advising Los Amigos Del Rio about monitoring Santa Fe Alloy’s 
attempts to get permits to process thorium from rare earth oxides, a process that could have seri-
ously aff  ected water quality along the Pecos near San Jose. Other early cases dealt with fuel leaks 
from underground storage tanks, the toxic waste at Los Alamos, and contamination from improp-
er waste disposal.
Mining: The Greatest Source of Water Pollution in NM
The most signiﬁ  cant water cases in the Law Center’s history have had to do with the pollution 
caused by mining and drilling activities that have predominantly aff  ected Native populations in 
New Mexico. In 1979, 95 million gallons of radioactive waste spilled into the Rio Puerco, ﬂ  owing 
through the Diné (Navajo) Reservation, through the towns of Church Rock and Gallup. The Law 
Center took up the challenge in the early 1990’s and began representing Eastern Navajo Diné 
Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM) in cases against industry and the government. ENDAUM 
and the Law Center won several major victories, including signiﬁ  cant strengthening of New 
Mexico’s uranium groundwater standard (2004), and adoption of the Navajo Natural Resources 
Protection Act, which bans uranium mining on Navajo lands (2005).
One of the most signifi  cant victories in the Law Center’s history came in 1993 
when we played a pivotal role in passing the New Mexico Mining Act.  Before the 
passage of this act, there were very few laws that regulated mining activities in New Mexico. 
However in 1993, when the Rio Galisteo ran foul with cyanide leaking from Cunningham Hill 
mine, Law Center founder Douglas Meiklejohn helped draft a new law that requires all hard-rock 
mines to develop reclamation plans, to restore surrounding land to self-sustaining ecosystems, 
and to post ﬁ  nancial assurance adequate to cover the costs of reclamation. Since the Mining Act’s 
passage, no irresponsible proposal for a new hard-rock mine has been permitted in the state. In 
addition, we have been able to get substantial partial reclamation at copper mines in Grant 
County and were able to get the largest mining reclamation bond in the country at the time for 
the Molycorp (now Chevron Mining) molybdenum mine in Questa. The copper mines owned 
by Freeport McMoRan now have the largest ﬁ  nancial assurance bonds in the country.
Where We Stand Now
The eff  orts to protect our current resources from contamination have been more diffi   cult 
under Governor Susana Martinez’s administration, which seeks to protect big polluters at the 
expense of public health and the environment. Her administration has weakened protections 
of groundwater, limited the ability of members of the public to participate, and made the oil 
and gas industry essentially self-regulating.
The following are some of the most signiﬁ  cant groundwater protection issues facing New 
Mexico and the Environmental Law Center now:
• Copper Rule   In a confusing and frustrating decision, the NM Supreme Court upheld 
the Copper Rule in March of this year, allowing companies to exclude the area beneath
open pit mines from water quality standards, creating water sacriﬁ  ce zones. We will now look 
at copper mine operations on a case-by-case basis and seek to rescind or modify the Rule.

 • Mt. Taylor Mine   The Law Center has appealed a “return to active” permit granted for the 
mine, which has not produced uranium ore since 1990 and will not produce ore during the permit 
period. The mine ought to be closed and reclaimed. Instead, the NM Mining and Minerals Division 
has created a new category of “zombie mines” that neither produce nor clean up.
 
• Kirtland Air Force Base Plume    After two decades, the US Air Force has neither 
fully characterized the toxic fuel plume nor achieved signiﬁ  cant cleanup. The spill threatens the 
most productive drinking water well ﬁ  eld in Albuquerque. In February, the NM Environment 
Department supported an Air Force report that has serious deﬁ  ciencies in data collection, analysis, 
and proposed actions. We are exploring our options with our clients.
 
• Aquifer Science   The water developer continues to pursue a permit to pump 1,500 acre-
feet of water annually for a proposed residential resort in Albuquerque’s East Mountains. The plan 
is clearly out-of-state water speculation. In March 2018, the Law Center went to court citing seri-
ously ﬂ  awed modeling used to support the permit and the fact that the State Engineer has already 
declared that there is no available new water. We are waiting for the judge’s decision.
 
• Augustin Plains Ranch   The Law Center argued in front of the State Engineer’s Hearing 
Offi   cer against granting Augustin Plains Ranch a permit to extract nearly 17 billion gallons of 
groundwater per year from the San Augustin Basin, west of Socorro. An Italian billionaire, whose 
previous applications have been rejected because they fail to identify end users and beneﬁ  cial 
uses for the water, owns the ranch. The Water Rights Division attorney said the application was 
speculative, but the ﬁ  nal decision now rests with the State Engineer.
 
• Copper Flat Mine    We won a victory in a water rights case that awarded only a small 
fraction of the water the mine’s owners were attempting to claim. Now, we are challenging the 
mine permit itself on both procedural grounds and on the basis of problems with the hydrologic 
data and modeling used to support the permit. 
 
• Water Quality Rules    The NM Environment Department petitioned the Water Quality 
Control Commission (WQCC) to change a number of water quality rules. We succeeded in getting 
some of the problematic changes withdrawn prior to the hearing, but there are still some serious 
issues. We have just ﬁ  led our exceptions (comments) to the Hearing Offi   cer’s Report and are wait-
ing for the WQCC’s decision.
 
• Santolina  The Bernalillo County Planning Commission and Bernalillo County Board 
of County Commissioners have approved every step of the master-planned community approval
process, even though the developer and the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility 
Authority have not produced the required Development Agreement detailing how the devel-
opment, which will have more than 90,000 people, will get its water. We recently ﬁ  led our 
brief with the Court of Appeals concerning the faulty county process as well as the incorrect 
decision by the District Court in not reviewing those decisions.
• Public Participation  In a critical decision that will have an impact on all our water 
work, the Court of Appeals found that the WQCC had erred in upholding the Environment 
Department’s decision to deny a public hearing on a discharge permit for a facility at Los 
Alamos National Laboratory. The Court stated that public participation is an inherent part of 
the permit process by forcing agencies to defend their decisions. Public hearings also create a 
record that is necessary to appeal a decision in the courts.
The Law Center depends on – and defends – public participation as the ﬁ  rst line of defense 
against polluters and agencies that fail to protect the environment and public health. We all 
depend on those individuals and community organizations who take the time and trouble to 
pay attention, show up at meetings, and protest against actions that harm the environment 
and their community. It is an honor to represent them when legal representation is necessary.
