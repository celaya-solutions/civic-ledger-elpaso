A Win for New Mexico’s Groundwater
New Mexicans’ groundwater is one step closer to being safeguarded from high levels of uranium – and 
not a minute too soon. 
In November, just after two uranium companies ﬁ led for exploratory permits in New Mexico, the 
state’s Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the health-based uranium groundwater standard advocated 
by the Law Center and adopted by the Water Quality Control Commission in 2004. Th e new standard 
of 30 micrograms/liter (μ/l), which is the same as the US Environmental Protection Agency’s drinking 
water standard, was revised from a 5,000 μ/l standard set in the 1970s during the last uranium boom in 
New Mexico. 
Shortly after the new standard was adopted, it was challenged by the NM Mining Association and the 
NM Oil and Gas Association, which asserted that uranium mining operators would be unable to meet 
the standard. Law Center attorney Eric Jantz, who represented ENDAUM in the appeal, has a diﬀ erent 
take on the situation. 
“Th e old standard was basically a license to pollute,” says Jantz. “Th e new standard recognizes the 
threat that uranium poses to people who drink contaminated water. Th e New Mexico Court of Ap-
peals unanimously agreed with us that human health is more important than uranium companies’ 
right to pollute groundwater.”
It is unknown at this time whether the industry groups will appeal to the NM Supreme Court.

New Environmental Justice Provisions 
for Solid Waste Facilities
In a proceeding that has taken several years from start to ﬁ nish, the New Mexico Environmental 
Improvement Board has adopted amendments to the State Solid Waste Management Regulations that 
include provisions designed to ensure environmental justice in the regulation of major solid waste facili-
ties such as landﬁ lls and incinerators. Although the Board did not accept all of the recommendations 
made by the Law Center, our clients, and other environmental justice advocates, the amendments to 
the Regulations do provide signiﬁ cant protection for low income communities and communities of 
color.
Th e proceeding that led to the Environmental Improvement Board’s action began several years ago 
continued on page 2

2007 Legislative Session Provides 
Opportunities and Threats
Th e New Mexico Legislature convenes at noon on Janu-
ary 17, 2007 for a 60 day session. Our attorneys will be 
working to enact legislation to protect communities and 
the environment and to prevent enactment of legislation 
that would harm them. Regrettably, we anticipate that the 
measures that will be introduced that would adversely aﬀ ect 
communities and the environment will outnumber those 
that would favor our communities and the environment.
Th ere is at least one piece of legislation that we anticipate 
working to pass. It is titled the Surface Owner Protec-
tion Act, and it would provide protection for the owners 
of the surface of the land who do not own the mineral 
estate beneath the surface. Under current law, as decided 
by the New Mexico courts, the mineral estate is dominant, 
which means that the owner of minerals such as oil and gas 
can come onto the surface of the land and use appropri-
ate means to extract the minerals. Current law also pro-
vides that the mineral owner does not have an obligation 
to provide notice to the surface owner or to compensate 
the surface owner for damages to the surface unless the 
mineral owner’s negligence, or carelessness, causes damage 
beyond what would normally be expected for the extrac-
tion operation. Th e Surface Owner Protection Act would 
change that by requiring that the surface owner be provided 
with notice, and that damages be paid to the surface owner 
even if the extraction of minerals is not done in a negligent 
manner. 
One of the most environmentally dangerous pieces of 
legislation that we expect to be introduced is a bill that 
would limit the state to protecting surface waters (rivers, 
streams, lakes, etc.) that are within the federal deﬁ nition 
of “waters of the United States.” Th at is the deﬁ nition that 
identiﬁ es waters protected by the United States under the 
federal Clean Water Act, and it has been narrowed signiﬁ -
cantly during recent years by the Bush administration and 
when the State Environment Department proposed amend-
ments to the Regulations, including amendments designed to 
promote environmental justice. Th ose proposed amendments 
were the subject of several rounds of comments to the De-
partment and negotiations between many interested parties. 
Th e Law Center represented two clients in the proceedings, 
the SouthWest Organizing Project and the South Valley (of 
Albuquerque) Coalition of Neighborhood Associations. Th e 
other principal environmental justice advocate throughout the 
process was the Environmental Justice Working Group of the 
Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice. 
As adopted, the amendments to the Regulations provide 
that an applicant for a permit to site a new major solid waste 
facility, or to expand an existing major facility, will have to de-
termine whether the proposed or existing facility is in a “vul-
nerable area.” Th e only exception to this is if the area where 
the existing or proposed facility is located has been designated 
for that type of facility through a zoning process that included 
consideration of environmental justice issues. 
Th e amendments deﬁ ne “vulnerable area” to mean an area 
within a four mile radius of the proposed or existing facility 
that has: 
1)  at least 50 people within New Mexico; 
2)  a greater percentage of low income households (deﬁ ned 
as having an income less than 150% of the federal pov-
erty guidelines for a family of four) within any square 
mile area than are in the state as a whole; and
3)  at least three regulated facilities (deﬁ ned as including 
various facilities that can aﬀ ect the environment signiﬁ -
cantly) other than the facility at issue.
If the proposed or existing facility that is the subject of the 
permit application is located in a vulnerable area, the ap-
plicant for the permit to site or expand the facility will have 
to demonstrate that issuance of the permit will not have a 
disproportionate impact on any socioeconomic group. In 
addition, if the existing or proposed facility is located in a vul-
nerable area, and if there is signiﬁ cant opposition to the siting 
or expansion of the facility, the amendments require that the 
applicant prepare a community impact report to determine 
what the impact of granting the application will be on the 
community.   
Both of these requirements are entirely new, and they will 
do much to protect low income communities and com-
munities of color where more than three regulated 
facilities are already located from the impacts of 
major solid waste facilities. Th e Law Center, its clients, 
and the Environmental Justice Working Group intend to 
work to ensure that these mandates are fulﬁ lled, and that 
the purpose of achieving environmental justice for these 
communities is achieved.

Fare Thee Well...
Th e Law Center bids farewell to Oﬃ  ce Manager Allison Dellinger and Earl James, 
our Director of Programs and Development. 
For 10 years, Allison kept the Law Center oﬃ  ce running smoothly. We half-jok-
ingly dubbed her our “global troubleshooter,” as she worked as our legal secretary, 
knower of all things that run on electricity, board and staﬀ  wrangler, receptionist, 
fundraiser, event planner and handywoman, to name but a few of her jobs. In addi-
tion, Allison served as our staﬀ  liaison to several local and statewide groups, including 
Santa Fe Earth Day and the New Mexico Food and Agricultural Policy Council. But 
she brought much more than eﬃ  ciency and the spectacular ability to multi-task to 
our oﬃ  ce; Allison also contributed a conscientious spirit, commitment to our mis-
sion, and true caring for her colleagues and for the people with whom we work
During Earl’s six years at the Law Center, he worked to increase our annual budget 
by nearly $250,000, expand the Center’s outreach through networking and coalition 
building, and strengthen the Board of Director’s fundraising capacity. His coalition-
building work brought many beneﬁ ts to New Mexico in the areas of environmental 
health and environmental advocacy. In 2004 he convened the New Mexico Environ-
ment and Health Coalition to advocate for statewide programs addressing the impact 
of pollution on the health of New Mexicans. Earl also helped to reinvigorate an envi-
ronmental legislative working group, bringing together environmental advocates from 
all around the state each year to select priority legislation for support by all groups.
We wish Allison and Earl all the best in their future endeavors.

the federal courts to include only waters that are connected with interstate waters. 
Because many of the water basins in New Mexico are not connected to interstate 
waters, the State Environment Department has estimated that passage of such 
legislation would mean that between 20% and 40% of New Mexico’s surface 
waters could not be protected. 
All four of the Law Center’s attorneys will be lobbying on these and other items 
during the legislative session. If any of our readers learn about positive or negative 
bills on which we should be working, please bring them to our attention. We ap-
preciate your help.
