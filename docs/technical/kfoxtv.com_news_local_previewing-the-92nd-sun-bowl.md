Previewing the 92nd Sun Bowl: Arizona State vs Duke
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX 14, CBS4) — El Paso is just one sleep away from kickoff of the 92nd Sun Bowl, as the Arizona State Sun Devils and the ACC champion Duke Blue Devils prepare to clash in one of the most anticipated matchups in the history of the nation’s second-oldest bowl game.
With kickoff fast approaching, the energy around the Sun Bowl continues to build. Fans from both sides have poured into the Borderland and the anticipation is rising for a game that features two programs trending sharply upward, each looking to close its season with a statement victory on a national stage.
Arizona State enters the Sun Bowl with an 8–4 record and an opportunity to secure its 20th win over the past two seasons. For head coach Kenny Dillingham and the Sun Devils, the bowl game represents another step toward their long-term goal of establishing ASU as one of college football’s premier programs.
"Four or five years from now hopefully these things that would be milestones and really good accomplishments slowly become somewhat expected," Dillingham said.
On the opposite sideline, Duke arrives in El Paso fresh off a historic season. The Blue Devils navigated adversity throughout the year, showing resilience during both highs and lows before ultimately coming together to claim their first outright conference championship in 63 years. Now, Duke has its sights set on putting an exclamation point on its remarkable season.
"It is a showing of our program on the up and up," Duke wide receiver Cooper Barkate said. "It would be huge for us. The ACC championship was a bit of a surprise but tremendous. Going out and beating a team that was ranked all season would be a big win. "
"Failure is not final," Duke head coach Manny Diaz said. "The best teams use failure as a great teacher and that is what we have learned."
Depth will be a key storyline for Arizona State, as the Sun Devils are expected to lean on several young and inexperienced players.
"It doesn't matter," Dillingham said. "We recruited those guys to play football and it's time to go play football. Let's have fun, play hard, do your job and fly around out there."
At the center of ASU's bowl chances is redshirt senior quarterback Jeff Sims, who took over midway through the season for an injured Sam Leavitt.
"I am happy he chose to stay here and got that opportunity," Dillingham said. "I'm happy to see really good people get an opportunity to perform and that is what he has done. He gets one more shot to do it [Wednesday] and I am going to do everything in my power to make sure he has the best game he's played in college football."
"Jeff has stepped up in a leadership role and with camaraderie with the guys," ASU wide receiver Derek Eusebio said, "He was always ready and not down when he wasn't playing. Us behind him is just a testament to him and his work."
For Sims, it is crucial he avoids turning the ball over which has been the achilles heel of his college career.
Duke’s offense is led by quarterback Darian Mensah, one of the top signal callers in the ACC and a player who gives the Blue Devils confidence every time he steps onto the field.
"Darian is such a good fit at Duke because he prepares with immense humility and plays with superior confidence," Diaz said. "That's what we explain to our guys. You prepare like you've never one and play like you've never lost."
Dillingham had high praise for Mensah and emphasized the necessity for his defense to create pressure.
"If you can't get to the quarterback rushing four, you have to send more," he said. "Send the fifth guy. If you can't get there with five, better send six because this is an NFL quarterback. We have to make him uncomfortable."
Amid preparations for the Sun Bowl, both teams have also had the opportunity to experience El Paso and embrace the culture of the 915.
Earlier on Tuesday, ASU players made a special stop at El Paso Children’s Hospital, where they spent time with patients, handed out toys, and shared moments of joy with children fighting some very tough battles.
While the visit was intended to bring smiles to the kids’ faces, the Sun Devils say they were ultimately the ones inspired — moved by the strength, resilience, and courage they witnessed throughout the hospital.
"It is an unbelievable blessing," ASU offensive lineman Ben Coleman said. "You talk about real world problems, we aren't the brave ones as football players. We have the easy job. These kids are the brave ones and the stuff they are going through is truly inspiring. The strength that they show and to still wake up and have a smile is super inspiring."
Kickoff is on Wednesday is at 12pm at the Sun Bowl.
