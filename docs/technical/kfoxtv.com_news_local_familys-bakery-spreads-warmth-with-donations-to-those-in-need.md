Community Spotlight: Local bakery spreads warmth with donations to those in need
El Paso, TX (KFOX14/CBS4) — EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) —What started as a family effort to give back has blossomed into a community-wide initiative, "We stumbled upon a small colonial that has an extreme need for everything you can imagine," said Kimberly Schmidt, owner of Delice Bakery.
The family, inspired by their grandfather's spirit of giving, has been collecting donations to help those in need for years. Schmidt recently opened up her bakery, Delice Bakehouse, this year and is now using her business platform as a force multiplier for bringing help to those in need.
"Once the community started to know that we were doing this, they all felt like they wanted to be involved," Schmidt said. The bakery is currently seeking donations of blankets, jackets, clothing, shoes, and gently used toys, especially with the cold weather and Christmas approaching. They also welcome materials like old tents and tarps to help protect homes from the elements.
Schmidt explained her motivation: "I do it to give back. I'm very blessed, and God has never let me down. There's no reason why a kid should go hungry or be cold if I have hundreds of blankets sitting in my closet."
The bakery will continue collecting donations throughout the month and invites the community to join them every Sunday to help deliver the items.
For more information, interested individuals can send a message to the bakery.
