El Paso Police Academy reduces from 11 months to 8.5; promises to maintain high standards
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — The El Paso Police Department’s 11-month training academy has been known as one of the longest programs in the country. But beginning in May, that will all change.
All their skills will be completed, it’s still going to be scenario-based training, it’s still going to be difficult and challenging for people to get out there, but it looks like we got it down to 8 1/2 months,” EPPD Chief Peter Pacillas said. “There is going to be some follow up training that the probationary officer has to go back to the academy and do once a week for about 15 weeks.
Beginning with the May academy class, thetime spent in the training program will be condensed from 11 months to 8 1/2, helping get officers to answer the call for help sooner as the city of El Paso continues to grow.
“The only thing I want to make sure people understand is that the standards are not going to be dropped, you’re still going to get the same quality of training that the current officers are getting,” Pacillas said.
Over the last 11 months, KFOX14 was able to give our viewers an inside look into the academy with our weekly segment of ‘Becoming the Badge’ to highlight the intense training civilians go through to become El Paso Police Officers.
“It took several years for us to be able to establish the academy at the standard that it’s at.” Pacillas said. “Lieutenant Johnson and his team, sergeant Ontiveros and the whole staff out there help set the standard.”
The academy now seeing an influx in applications amid a nationwide police shortage.
“The class that just started in January, we got it up to 30 police trainees, so we saw an uptick in the applications that came in,” Pacillas said. “We have a committed recruiting department, we’ve hired a marketing firm to help us market it and we’ve also seen traditionally with the segment ‘Becoming the Badge’, a positive direct effect. What I’ve learned we have to get out there and tell our story, tell the story of what it is to be an El Paso Police Officer.”
