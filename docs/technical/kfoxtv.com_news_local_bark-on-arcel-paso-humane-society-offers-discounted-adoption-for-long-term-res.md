Bark on Arc:El Paso Humane Society offers discounted adoption for long-term resident Penny
El Paso, TX (KFOX14/CBS4) — Penny, a four-year-old shepherd mix, is seeking a forever home at the El Paso Humane Society.
Described as "very loyal" and "very smart," Penny knows numerous tricks and enjoys cozy settings, according to A.J., a representative from the shelter.
Despite her charming personality, Penny has been in and out of the shelter, making her the third longest resident currently. At one point, she was the longest resident, having stayed over 400 days.
To encourage adoption, the shelter has reduced Penny's adoption fee.
Normally priced at $70, which includes her spay, microchip, and vaccines, Penny's fee is further discounted to $35 every Friday and Saturday throughout December. A.J. emphasized the importance of finding Penny a home, noting that her extended stays have been challenging for her morale.
For those interested in adopting Penny, she is available at the El Paso Humane Society, offering a wonderful opportunity for a family looking for a loyal companion this holiday season.
