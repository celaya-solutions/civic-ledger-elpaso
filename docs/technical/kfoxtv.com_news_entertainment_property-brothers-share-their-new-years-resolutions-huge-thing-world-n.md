Property Brothers share 'huge thing the world needs' in their New Year's resolutions
As the calendar turns, HGTV stars Jonathan and Drew Scott are entering the new year with goals that go beyond fresh paint and renovated kitchens. The twin duo behind the "Property Brothers" franchise opened up about their New Year’s resolutions and they’re as much about mindset as they are about productivity.

Jonathan Scott said his focus for the year ahead is breaking out of routines and leaning into authenticity. “I think to say goodbye to boring,” Jonathan explained to our entertainment reporter, Courtney Tezeno. “I don’t want to just keep doing the same things that people expect to see. Try and do something unique and special, and especially something that represents you and what you love.”

Along with creativity, Jonathan emphasized the importance of compassion. “Go out of your way to show kindness,” he added. “I think that is just a huge thing that the world needs right now.”
Drew Scott built on his brother’s thoughts by zeroing in on a common struggle many people face at the start of a new year: procrastination. “We all as humans have the great ability to procrastinate and put off the big things that are really important to us,” Drew said, whether those goals are tied to work, relationships, or family.
He encouraged people to recognize when they’re busy with small, easy tasks that offer quick satisfaction instead of tackling what truly matters. “Stop yourself right there, and go to the big thing right away,” Drew emphasized. “If you chisel away at that, and you look back a year later, you’re gonna realize you have moved mountains.”

Fans won’t have to wait long to see the Scott brothers back on screen. “Celebrity IOU” with special guest John Stamos debuted on Dec. 28 on HGTV. They also teased their episodes with Eva Longoria and William Shatner this season. The duo will also return with “Don’t Hate Your House with the Property Brothers,” which aired on Dec. 29, with episodes available to stream the next day on Discovery+ and HBO Max.
As the Scotts ring in the new year, their message is clear: take risks, be kind, and don’t put off what matters most.
