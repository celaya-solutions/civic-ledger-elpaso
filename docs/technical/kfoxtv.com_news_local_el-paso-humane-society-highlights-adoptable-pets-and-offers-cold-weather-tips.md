El Paso Humane Society highlights adoptable pets and offers cold weather tips
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — The El Paso Humane Society is spotlighting Felicity, a 6-year-old German Shepherd mix, as part of their weekly "Bark on Arc" segment.
Felicity is described as "super, super friendly" and eager to greet everyone with a paw. As temperatures drop, the Humane Society is advising pet owners on how to care for their animals in the cold. "If you're cold, they're cold," said a representative, emphasizing the importance of keeping pets warm.
Dogs with shorter coats, like pit bulls and boxers, may need jackets or booties to protect their sensitive paws. For outdoor animals, insulated housing is recommended, with hay being a good insulator.
The Humane Society encourages the community to consider adopting pets like Felicity and to ensure their animals are well-protected during the colder months.
