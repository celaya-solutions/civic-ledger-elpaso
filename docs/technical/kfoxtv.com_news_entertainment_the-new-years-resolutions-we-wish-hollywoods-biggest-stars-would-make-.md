The new year is here, and while most of us are promising to hit the gym, drink more water, or finally snag that sweet samurai sword on eBay (just me?), Hollywood has bigger problems.
So, in the spirit of giving, we’ve written the New Year’s resolutions we wish celebrities would make — completely free, totally unsolicited, and 100% better than any PR-approved plan.
Ready or not, here come the resolutions!
