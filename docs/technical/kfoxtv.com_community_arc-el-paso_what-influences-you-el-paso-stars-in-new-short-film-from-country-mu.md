What Influences You: El Paso stars in new short film from country music artist MORIAH
EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — El Paso takes center stage in "Nice Life," a new short film by rising country artist MORIAH.
The singer-songwriter, with deep roots in the borderland, describes the project as a love letter to the Sun City and its vibrant culture.
"I was able to film the 'Nice Life' short film in the beautiful city of El Paso, where all of my family is from," MORIAH said.
"My goal in leaving Nashville, Tennessee, bringing my crew all the way to El Paso, Texas, hiring local crew and telling this story, was to showcase the beauty of a place that is right on the border, and that so many people often miss."
The film, which began as a music video, features iconic El Paso locations like the Plaza Theater and downtown streets, with the city itself becoming a character in the story.
MORIAH emphasizes the importance of highlighting overlooked areas and drawing out their beauty.
"To me, as an artist, I feel like part of, I don't know if it's just the way I was made, or something that I feel called to, but I feel it's important to put a spotlight on the areas that get overlooked, and to pull the beauty out of something super simple," she said.
This blending of cultures is also evident in her music.
MORIAH made history at the 2025 Country Music Association Fest by performing the national anthem with a mariachi band, a first for the festival.
"I just always imagined our national anthem being played by a mariachi band," she said. "But what ended up happening was a beautiful collision of culture," MORIAH said.
NATIONAL ANTHEM PERFORMANCE:
MORIAH's influences range from country icons to Latin legends like Selena, and she hopes to inspire the next generation of musicians.
"I hope to create an opportunity for someone who maybe was like me, a little girl who had a love for music and a love for singing, but didn't have very many examples in her life or in her family of what that looked like," MORIAH said.
The "Nice Life" short film is now streaming and will head to film festivals in 2026.
MORIAH plans to return to El Paso in 2026 for more collaborations, continuing her mission to inspire through music and cultural expression.
You can follow MORIAH on her official website, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, X and Bandsintown.
