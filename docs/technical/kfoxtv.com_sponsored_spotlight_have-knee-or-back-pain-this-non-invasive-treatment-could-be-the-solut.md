Have knee or back pain? This non-invasive treatment could be the solution you need
For people struggling with chronic back or knee pain, surgery can often feel like the only option. But Dr. Brian Hesser and his team at Millennium Health & Wellness are changing that outlook, offering advanced, non-surgical treatments that help patients feel better without going under the knife.
Using innovative technology and natural healing techniques, Dr. Hesser has earned a strong reputation in both New Mexico and West Texas for helping people get out of pain and back to living active lives.
A new approach to spine care
Many patients come to Dr. Hesser after trying everything from medications to injections, often without success. One of the clinic’s key treatments is non-surgical spinal decompression, which gently stretches the spine to relieve pressure on compressed nerves and damaged discs.
This is combined with supportive therapies like shockwave therapy, laser treatment, and rehabilitation to help the spine heal and stay strong long-term.
“We’re not just focused on pain relief,” Dr. Hesser says. “We’re focused on actually repairing the source of the problem.”
Natural solutions for knee pain
Whether it’s arthritis, an old sports injury, or general wear and tear, knee pain is one of the most common complaints seen at Millennium’s clinics. Instead of recommending surgery, Dr. Hesser and his team use regenerative therapies to support the body’s natural ability to heal.
This includes:
- Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to encourage tissue repair
- Biologic injections from donated birth tissue, which may help restore cartilage and joint function
These treatments are designed to reduce pain, improve mobility, and often delay or eliminate the need for knee replacement surgery.
With clinics in both Las Cruces, NM, and El Paso, TX, Millennium Health & Wellness is a trusted go-to destination for patients throughout the Southwest seeking alternatives to surgery.
Thousands have turned to Dr. Hesser’s expertise and have seen life-changing results—from walking without pain again to avoiding major operations altogether. His commitment to patient-centered care has also earned him recognition as one of America’s top doctors for spinal decompression and neuropathy care.
“We treat every patient like family,” Dr. Hesser says. “We take the time to understand the issue and tailor a plan that actually works—without rushing into surgery.”
Relief without the risks of surgery
Millennium’s approach blends innovative treatments, physical rehab, and regenerative medicine—all in one setting. It’s a modern, team-based model that gives patients more options and better outcomes.
“You don’t have to live with pain. And you don’t have to settle for surgery,” says Dr. Hesser. “We’re here to help you heal—safely, naturally, and effectively.”
