ATV rollover near Rio Grande River trail leaves four injured, one in serious condition
SUNLAND PARK, N.M. (KFOX14/CBS4) — Four people were hospitalized-- one in serious condition-- after an all-terrain vehicle rolled over near the Rio Grande River trail Thursday night.
According to the Sunland Park Fire Department, emergency crews responded to an ATV rollover after the vehicle reportedly fell into a canal just off the river at around 8:23 p.m.
A total of four people were injured, but one of them, a man in his early 20s, reportedly suffered serious injuries and had to be flown out of the area and rushed to the hospital by an El Paso Fire Department helicopter.
The other three injured were a girl in her late teens, a boy in his mid-teens and another boy just described as a minor.
Their injuries were described as "non-life-threatening."
Regarding what caused the rollover, the Sunland Park fire believes that the ATV riders were going fast while being unfamiliar with the territory.
Dona Ana County Fire and Rescue also helped.
