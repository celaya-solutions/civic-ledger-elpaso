McDonald's Boo Buckets return just in time for spooky season - See the designs
WASHINGTON (TNND) — Just in time for Halloween, McDonald's iconic Happy Meal Boo Buckets are making a frightening return to the fast food chain.
The buckets are back for customers as of October 21, and this time, there are five designs.
The 2025 lineup includes the familiar Ghost, Pumpkin and Goblin as well as two new spooky pals, Cat and Zombie.
Each bucket comes with Halloween-themed stickers and, of course, a Happy Meal, while supplies last.
In 2024, the company redesigned the buckets, which led to criticism all over social media. While the 2025 buckets are not exact replicas of the past, the designs appear more similar to those from 2023.
Other fast food chains are also getting in on the spooky fun.
Wendy's has a Frosty Frights Kids' meal for Halloween and kids can collect 12 Frosty-inspired toys from the meal.
Last month, Burger King announced its first-ever Monster Menu. They also created a Halloween-themed King Jr. Meal, which comes with Scooby Doo-themed toys. Burger King also announced its own Halloween Bucket.
