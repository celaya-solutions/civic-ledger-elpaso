Major Hurdle Cleared in New Mexico
Climate Change Case
“
”
The threat to public health from
mercury, sulfur dioxide, and 
nitrogen oxides is serious enough
to warrant immediate action. 
Yet this threat pales in comparison
to the financial and health costs
from unchecked global warming.
With American coal plants alone
adding over two billion tons of 
carbon dioxide to the atmosphere
each year, we must ask ourselves:
what are the costs of not quickly
enacting climate change 
legislation and investing in 
a new energy economy? 
Dr. John Fogarty, Director of New Energy
Economy (NEE), wrote these words in an
editorial to the New Mexico 
Independent in
December 2008. His article ran after we
petitioned the State on behalf of NEE to
adopt the country’s most significant limits
on carbon emissions.  
In April, we and the NM Environment
Department (NMED) both argued – and won
– an important decision from the New
Mexico Environmental Improvement Board
that the Board can regulate greenhouse gases
as air pollutants.  We were opposed by many
of New Mexico’s biggest corporations and
trade groups, including PNM, the NM Oil
and Gas Association, and the Dairy Producers
of New Mexico; their experts testified that
greenhouse gases fall outside of the Board’s
jurisdiction. 
As a result of this decision, the Board will
hold a public hearing in late 2009 or 2010 to
determine whether to impose a cap on 
greenhouse gas emissions, and if so, what
that cap should be. At that hearing, we will
argue that New Mexico must take the route 
dictated by nearly all of the world’s climate
scientists: we must reduce our greenhouse
gas emissions by at least 25% below 1990
levels by 2020 or face catastrophic impacts.
NMED will likely argue that the State
should adopt the carbon caps recommended
by the Western Climate Initiative, which
would lower our state’s 
emissions by 15%
below 2005 levels by 2020.
“We’ve reached a point where we can no
longer take half-measures,” says Bruce
Frederick, counsel on the case. “Our job at
the hearing will be to advocate that New
Mexico must adopt the carbon caps 
championed by 1,200 of the world’s leading
scientists; if we don’t, we face catastrophic
problems such as prolonged drought, new
diseases and massive wildfires, to name a
few. Granted, New Mexico is a small fish in
a global pond of carbon emitters, but if 
New Mexico can do what is 
scientifically necessary, other 
states can do it as well. Our 
leadership on this issue will help 
our country become part of the 
climate solution, instead of a 
big part of the climate problem.”
“So if you can shape your renewables, you
don't need fossil fuel or nuclear plants to
run all the time. And, in fact, most plants
running all the time in your system are an
impediment because they're very inflexible.
You can't ramp up and ramp down a
nuclear plant. And if you have instead the
ability to ramp up and ramp down loads in
ways that can shape the entire system, then
the old concept of [coal and nuclear power]
becomes an anachronism.”
– Jon Wellinghoff, Chair of the Federal 
Energy Regulation Commission, to the 
U.S. Energy Association, April 21, 2009.

Nuclear Revitalization Commission?
Case Updates
Big Copper Goes to Court 
After the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) licensed uranium mines in the drink-
ing water aquifer underlying the Crownpoint-
Church Rock region, we thought perhaps 
the agency should be renamed the Nuclear
Revitalization Commission. After reading
the NRC’s final draft of the Generic
Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) for
in 
situ leach (ISL) uranium mining, we are
pretty sure that the name change is in order.
The Final GEIS, released on June 5th,
addresses common environmental issues
associated with the construction, operation,
and decommissioning of ISL facilities, as
well as groundwater restoration at such
facilities in Nebraska, New Mexico, South
Dakota and Wyoming. The NRC explains 
on its website that it developed the GEIS in
order to facilitate its review of a large number
of anticipated ISL uranium mining license
applications.  As of May 2009, the agency is
expecting 17 such applications before the
end of 2010.
The Law Center submitted technical 
comments in November 2008, most of
which seem to have been ignored by the
NRC. The agency did bend on one signifi-
cant point, however.  Instead of requiring
Environmental Assessments at new proposed
mines, the agency will require the completion
of Supplemental Environmental Impact
Statements before it makes licensing
decisions. Environmental Impact
Statements involve more thorough site-
specific reviews than Assessments, and
have provisions for public comment. 
“The decision to do ‘full’ environmental
reviews is positive,” says Law Center Staff
Attorney Jonathan Block. “But one has to
take a wait-and-see attitude because you’re
dealing with an agency that has a very bad
history in terms of handling these kinds 
of matters.” 
We are working with our clients to
develop our next steps in this case.
On another front, the uranium industry
is pushing the NRC to allow it to build
infrastructure at proposed in ISL mines
before those mines are licensed. Industry
representatives met with NRC staff in
November 2008 to outline their pre-
licensing construction plan.  
To date, we have agreed with the NRC’s
interpretation of the rule, which does not
allow companies to build first and get
licensed later.
“This is just a terrible idea,” says Block,
who submitted comments to the NRC on
this matter in May. “If regulators let 
corporations sink millions of dollars into
infrastructure, then they have less ability 
to turn the projects down, which is exactly
what these companies are gambling on.”

In January 2009, we had a major victory when the NM Water Quality Control Commission
ruled that Freeport McMoRan (formerly Phelps Dodge) is responsible for cleaning up the
acidic, metals-laden groundwater beneath its 12,000 acre Tyrone mine complex. 
Two months later, the company appealed to the state appellate court to overturn the
Commission’s ruling. Law Center Staff Attorney Bruce Frederick represents the Gila
Resources Information Project (GRIP), a Silver City-based non-profit group, in this litigation.
“Contrary to the arguments put forth by Freeport McMoRan, contaminated groundwater 
doesn’t just stop at the company’s fenceline,” says Frederick. “We will argue to the Court of
Appeals that the Commission made the right decision for Tyrone, and the right decision 
for New Mexico.”
The outcome of this case will impact the ability of the Commission to mandate 
groundwater cleanup at large industrial sites throughout the State.

Neutron Energy
gets Green Light
Uranium company Hydro Resources, Inc.
(HRI) is having a tough year so far. In
March, its biggest investor, Itochu Corp. 
of Japan, dissolved its partnership with the
beleaguered uranium mining company.
Less than a month later, HRI lost a critical
decision in the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals.
In a lawsuit against the federal govern -
ment, HRI contended that its Church Rock
Section 8 property in the “Checkerboard”
region bordering the Navajo Nation is like
any other private land in New Mexico, and
subject to State jurisdiction.  However, after
examining evidence that 97% of the 
community surrounding the Section 8 
minesite is Navajo, two of the three judges
hearing the case disagreed with the company,
and ruled that the proposed minesite falls
under tribal and federal jurisdiction.
(While the Law Center was key to the
administrative proceedings pertaining to this
ruling, we did not participate in the federal
lawsuit.)
The ruling could affect HRI in two ways.
First, if the company has no other setbacks,
it would be required to apply for and
receive an “underground injection control
permit” from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency before it could begin
mining. Second, and more important, 
the ruling could signal that HRI’s proposed
mining would be prohibited under the
Navajo Nation’s ban on uranium mining
and milling.
“The ruling rejects the position of HRI,
which contended that its small island of
[private] land was, in essence, excluded
from the community,” Navajo Nation
Resources Committee Chairman George
Arthur told the Gallup 
Independent.
Arthur, who sponsored the mining ban, 
continued, “That position would allow the
fabric of Navajo communities to be
destroyed from within anytime there is a
small tract of non-Indian land within the
community boundaries.”
This is a significant ruling, and if it 
stands, will be very useful to our clients in
their effort to defeat HRI’s ill-conceived
scheme to mine uranium in the drinking
water aquifer for these communities.
Hopefully, HRI has not yet seen the last of
the bad news this year. We are still awaiting
a ruling from the 10th Circuit Court on our
lawsuit against the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission to overturn the mining license
it granted to HRI in 1996. 
Hydro Resources Dealt Major Setbacks
Is Hydro Resources looking at Easy Street…or an
Avenue of broken dreams? URANIUM DRIVE © Alptraum | Dreamstime.com
For more than a year, Law Center 
attorney Eric Jantz worked with the Haaku
Water Office of Acoma Pueblo to prevent
the issuance of the state’s first non-minimal
impact exploration permit for uranium. In
the end, however, the Mining and Minerals
Division granted the permit for Neutron
Energy’s Marquez Canyon site. Neutron
Energy will drill on the flank of Mt. Taylor
(
Kaweshtima, in the Keres language), a
site that is culturally important to as many
as 30 Native American tribes.  
“This is the first time that the State has
issued this type of permit for uranium, ”
says Jantz. “Because of the element’s toxic
and radiological characteristics, as well as
its readiness to mobilize into groundwater 
when exposed to oxygen, uranium mining
requires a higher level of regulation than
other hardrock mining.”  
When asked about the decision, Jantz
reflected, “Unfortunately, in our legal 
system, cultural destruction is not enough
to prevent mining.  The only silver lining
is that we did set some good environment
precedent with this permit, which should
translate to future uranium permits in 
New Mexico.”
On April 28, 2009, the National
Trust for Historic Preservation
named Mt. Taylor (near Grants,
NM) to its 2009 list of 11 Most
Endangered Places in America.

We would like to congratulate Staff Attorney Jonathan Block, who was admitted to the New Mexico
State Bar on April 20.  Jon, who joined our staf f in June 2008, has nearly two decades of experience
as an attorney under his belt, primarily in private practice. Except the fact that he doesn’t own a dog,
Jon fits right in at the Law Center. He is a crusader who has spent much of his legal career fighting
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on behalf of citizens’ groups; in his case, he worked to improve
the environmental and safety track records of nuclear power plants in New England. When not saving
this corner of the world, Jon is an accomplished jazz pianist and infamous groan-inspiring punster.
PR Powerhouse Helps Law Center 
New Staff Attorney Seeks to Pun-ish Polluters  
At the age of 13, Jennifer Marshall would
get up at 4:30 a.m. on Fridays to picket in
front of the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory
near Troy, NY . “I am very anti-nuke,”
Marshall says with a smile, “and when I
moved to New Mexico in 2000, I knew 
I had to get involved with the Law Center
because of your work on fighting against
uranium mining in New Mexico.  I’m 
especially passionate about the HRI case.
It’s unfathomable that the NRC would allow
a company to mine uranium in a 
community’s municipal drinking water.”
She launched the Marshall Plan, a leading
marketing and communications firm in 2007
after a decade of working on marketing and
public relations campaigns in Santa Fe. She
now donates her time and expertise to the
Law Center working on strategic, long-
range marketing and public relations plans. 
“I work directly with the legal and
development staff keeping a steady flow
of information to the media.  I absolutely
love it.”
Thinking about the many important
cases the Law Center has taken on in the
past 21 years, Marshall comments, “These
cases are so huge and I can’t believe that
they are being handled by this tiny non-
profit! Whenever I can jump in and help;
it is an honor and a privilege.”
“The Law Center fights the good fight
for many people, in some cases for more
than a decade,” says Marshall. “You guys
stand up for all New Mexicans, and aren’t
doing the work to be popular with politi-
cians and industry leaders. You do the
work for the citizens of New Mexico.”
The Law Center 
sincerely thanks 
Jennifer Marshall for 
lending us her great talent,
passion and commitment.
The Law Center family mourns the passing of Richard Deertrack, client,
ally, leader, teacher and friend.  We met Richard in 1994 when he requested
our assistance on behalf of Taos Pueblo to prevent or limit the proposed
expansion of the Taos Airport. Soon, he joined our Board of Directors, and
ably led our organization as our Vice-President (2000-2002) and President
(2002-2007). We have lost a good friend. We will miss his gentle 
encouragement, his deep wisdom, and most of all his tireless pursuit for
justice for all peoples and Mother Earth.
We also are deeply saddened to report the death of 
Luke Cole. Luke was a founder and the Director 
of the Center on Race, Poverty, and the Environment in San Francisco, as well as one of the leading
environmental justice attorneys in the country, even though he was only 46.  He represented communi -
ties suffering environmental injustice throughout the nation, and he was a leading spokesperson for environmental justice on the national
level as well. He served as a very effective witness for the Law Center in the 2005 proceeding to include environmental justice provisions 
in the State Solid Waste Management Regulations, and he was always an ally in our work to protect communities. He will be truly missed.

A Bar by any other name?
Law Center Executive Director Douglas
Meiklejohn has received many awards over
the years, but nearly all of them have come
from groups or programs that work to 
promote environmental and social justice.  He was pleasantly surprised
when he received a call from the
New Mexico Business Weekly
informing him that he was one of the newspaper ’s inaugural “Best of the
Bar” award recipients.  Doug was one of 25 attorneys from across the
state who were recognized as “tops in their areas of expertise,” and one of
three lawyers to be honored in the field of Energy and Natural Resources
law.  The Business Weekly solicited nominations from the public, and
winners were chosen by an anonymous panel that included a retired
District Court judge and a former state Attorney General.  
Congratulations, Doug!

From the Executive Director  
Dear Friends,
How does the Law Center become an even better,
more effective organization? It’s a good question, and
we’re hip-deep in a strategic planning process to find
the answers.  For the past year, our staff, board and
volunteers have spoken with dozens of clients, 
colleagues, regulators, funders, and even an opponent
or two in order to better gauge the needs of New
Mexicans and get an idea about the public perception
of our organization. We’ve analyzed trends, examined
threats, identified opportunities, and brainstormed
until our heads ached. Our goal is to distill all of this
into a three-year Strategic Plan that will be done 
this year.
As a result of the process, we pledge to be even
bigger and more bold, creative and staunchly 
committed to the health of communities and the 
environment across New Mexico. We are aiming for
an audacious outcome because the needs of our state’s
communities are great. If nothing else, we know we
have to do more and better for ourselves, be more
effective and proactive than before, and make  
After you care for your loved ones, will you care for New Mexico?

land and communities of New Mexico for years to come.
