Re: Request for Adequate Public Notice – Acoma LLC Permit Applications 
Dear New Mexico Environment Department:   
Thank you for your response to our December 12 letter, attached, expressing initial 
interest in Acoma, LLC’s two air pollution permit applications for the following facilities related 
to Project Jupiter:  
West Microgrid: latitude 31.82333 dec deg North and longitude -106.713056 dec deg West, 
  approximately 4.1 miles southwest of Santa Teresa in Doña Ana County. 
East Microgrid: latitude 31.818333 dec deg North and longitude -106.679167 dec deg West, 
 Approximately 3.6 miles south of Santa Teresa in Doña Ana County. 
While we appreciate that the Department intends to post Acoma, LLC’s redacted 
applications to the NMED Website by 12/17/2025, we strongly urge notice of the complete 
applications be broadly disseminated, in both English and Spanish, at physical locations in the 
impacted communities of Sunland Park and Santa Teresa, due to the important and significant 
public interest in this microgrid power plant project and its associated Project Jupiter. In addition, 
community members often do not have reliable internet access, and many may not know to 
check the Department’s website. Thus, we request notice of the administratively complete 
applications be posted, along with instructions for public participation, in English and Spanish in 
the following locations:

  In  addition,  due  to  the  public  importance  of  the  applications,  we  urge  NMED  to  do  the  
following:
  (1)   Extend  the  initial  thirty-day  comment  period  an  additional  thirty  (30)  days ,  in  order  
to
 
ensure
 
all
 
interested
 
parties
 
are
 
given
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
air
 
pollution
 
permit
 
Applications.
 
(2)  Ensure  a  public  hearing  is  held  no  earlier  than  90  days  after  NMED  has  made  its  
analyses
 
available
 
for
 
public
 
review.
 
 
(3)  The  applications  need  to  be  publicly  accessible,  containing  all  information,  modeling,  
and
 
technical
 
data
 
necessary
 
for
 
community
 
members
 
to
 
meaningfully
 
evaluate
 
the
 
applications
 
and
 
the
 
significant
 
adverse
 
public
 
health
 
impacts
 
posed
 
by
 
Project
 
Jupiter.
 
 
(4)  The  applications  must  be  publicly  available  in  both  English  and  Spanish ,  as  well  as  
all
 
notices
 
of
 
public
 
hearings
 
and
 
decisions
 
on
 
the
 
applications.
 
(5)  Any  public  hearing  must  be  held  in  Santa  Teresa ,  so  all  members  of  nearby  
communities
 
who
 
stand
 
to
 
be
 
impacted
 
by
 
this
 
Project
 
can
 
attend
 
in-person
 
and
 
meaningfully
 
participate
 
in
 
this
 
public
 
process.
