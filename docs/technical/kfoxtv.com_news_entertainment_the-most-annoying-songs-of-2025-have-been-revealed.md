The most annoying songs of 2025 have been revealed!
The most annoying songs of the year have been named via research from StudyFinds.org.
The ticket search engine SeatPick revealed data from a study of viral songs from the year, compiled by the organization.
The study analyzed specific factors of this year’s most popular songs and compared them against “an annoying index,” which measures four components that make up the total score: repetition (loops and melodic patterns) at 30%, brightness (produces overly harsh, piercing sounds), harmonic dullness, and filler each at 20% (words and sounds like “yeah,” Ugh,” “la,” and “ooh”) and a baseline factor at 10%. The index then predicted the potential annoyingness of a song, where higher scores show a bigger annoyance.
Sabrina Carpenter takes the top two spots on the list, “Sugar Talking” and “Tears,” both from the Grammy-nominated album “Man’s Best Friend,” are in first and second place, respectively, with a score of 46% (which means these songs would annoy 46% of listeners!)
Lady Gaga’s “The Dead Dance” from the “Wednesday” season 2 soundtrack takes the number 3 spot and has a 45.8% chance that people would find the song annoying, according to the annoyingness index.
The rest of the list stays between a 45.1% and 44% on the annoyance meter. These songs are Jimin’s “Who,” David Guetta and Sia’s “Beautiful People,” Luke Dean and Omar+’s “Make Believe,” Tate McCrae’s “Just Keep Watching,” Dom Dolla’s “Dreamin’,” Ed Sheeran’s “Azizam,” and Chrystal’s “The Days.”
There’s also a Most Annoying Viral TikTok Songs list with PinkPantheress’ “Illegal” in first place with a 44% chance of it being annoying. Sombr’s “Undressed” is in second with 43.3%. Sabrina Carpenter is on the list again with “Manchild,” and Nicki Minaj’s 2012 hit “Beez in the Trap” are both at a 42.1% chance of annoyance.
Is there a song that’s more annoying to you than these?!
