Legal Jargon: El Paso Attorney talks all things Jury Duty
El Paso, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) In a recent segment of "Legal Jargon", ARC El Paso sat down with attorney Daniela Labinoti to talk all things jury duty.
As the holiday season approaches, many people are preparing to travel to visit family and friends. However, what happens if you receive a jury duty summons that conflicts with your travel plans? Attorney Daniela Labinoti advises that ignoring a jury duty summons is not an option. "Do not ignore the summons of jury duty," she said. "Judges have a lot of power to sanction you, and the sanction could be a fine or jail."
Labinoti suggests contacting the court as soon as possible if you find yourself in this situation. "There is a deferral, meaning they can pass you for another trial that is coming up, or they will give you an excuse," she explained. The key is to communicate with the court and provide a reason for your inability to attend. Each court may have different procedures, so it's important to follow their specific protocol.
While some courts may require documentation, such as a doctor's note, others may not. "It depends on what they ask," Labinoti said. "Every court has different procedures." The most important thing is to not ignore the summons and to contact the court to discuss your options.
