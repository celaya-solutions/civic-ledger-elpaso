If a hurricane is likely to strike near your home, take the following steps:
- Stay informed of the storm's track. Watch the Weather Experts or listen to our radio partners for the latest information.
- Secure your home. Close storm shutters, secure outdoor objects and turn off propane tanks.
- Ensure you have a supply of water in case the water is shut off. Fill the bath tub and other large containers with water.
If you are unable to evacuate during a storm:
- Go to a wind-safe room. If you do not have one, then move away from windows and glass doors. Close all interior doors. Secure and brace external doors. Keep curtains and blinds closed. Avoid elevators.
- Take refuge. You can do so in a small interior room, closet or hallway on the lowest level of your home. Lie on the floor under a table or another sturdy object.
Although the first concern should be safety, it is important to be aware of the need to act promptly when filing claims for damages inflicted to your property by a hurricane.
- Have your policy number available.
- Contact your insurance company as soon as possible.
- Make a list of damages. If possible, document damage with photos.
- Fill out claim forms from insurance company and return them promptly.
- Be sure you understand the claim process. If you are unfamiliar with it or do not understand, ask for a full explanation.
- Contact your insurance company before an emergency to see if you are prepared if a disaster should occur.
