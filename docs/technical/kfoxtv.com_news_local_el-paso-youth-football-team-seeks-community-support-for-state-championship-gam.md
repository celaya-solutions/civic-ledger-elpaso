El Paso youth football team seeks community support for state championship bid
El Paso, TX (KFOX14/CBS4) — The El Paso Slaughter Gang Sharks, a youth football team, are gearing up for the state championships in San Marcos this Sunday.
The team, comprised of seven-year-olds and under, will face the Alamo City Colts at Texas State University on Dec. 7.
This marks the second time in three years the Sharks have reached the state championship, having first competed as five-year-old flag football players.
The team is seeking community support to help fund their trip. "We have a handful of families that basically need assistance," said Coach Steven Deucher.
Efforts are underway to ensure every family can travel with the group, allowing each child the opportunity to participate in the championship game.
The Sharks are undefeated this season, and their journey to the state championship has been a testament to their hard work and dedication. "These guys are just different," said a team member. "They put them up there for most different."
Community members interested in supporting the Sharks can pay them on Cashapp at $EPSharks.
