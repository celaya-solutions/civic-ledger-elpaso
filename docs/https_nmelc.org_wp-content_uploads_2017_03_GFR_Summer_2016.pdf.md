Did you know you can make a gift to the Law Center in your will?
Hazardous low-level and transuranic waste
remains at sites around the sprawling campus
of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL),
impacting water and air quality. Staff
Attorney Jon Block continues to work
closely with advocates to pursue legal
solutions to improving cleanup and to
ensure that members of local communities
have a meaningful role in decision-making.
So far this year, his work has involved two
major cases. Support from Law Center
members makes it possible for us to 
take on important cases like these.

2 New Campaigns for Better Cleanup at LANL
With the help of its members, the Law Center continues to help local groups mount
legal fights for meaningful cleanup at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).
“LANL has been hiding behind the wastewater treatment unit exemption for nearly six 
years,”  explains Joni Arends of CCNS. “In order to protect our health and environment 
and to provide transparency in its regulatory efforts, it is time for EPA to terminate 
Outfall 051 from the LANL discharge permit.”  – Joni Arends, CCNS executive director
For more information, please contact Elizabeth Lee at 505.989.9022or elee@nmelc.org. 
Our 30th Anniversary is next year!
We're looking for great volunteers to help 
with house parties, our inaugural parade float,  
and getting the word out about the Law Center!

CLEANUP DEADLINES MISSED
By Los Alamos National Lab
Case Up dates

Case Up dates
29 Years of Environmental and Community Victories     3
Holding the Lab Accountable for Failure to
Clean Up Over the Past Decade
Client:Nuclear Watch New Mexico (NukeWatch)
Co-Counsel: Lindsay Lovejoy and John Stroud
Process: Petition to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico
$300 million and climbing. That is the estimated amount of fines that
should have been levied against LANL for blowing past mandatory
cleanup and reporting deadlines outlined in a 2005 “Consent Order”, 
even after dozens of those deadlines were repeatedly extended by the
Martinez Administration. 
After LANL missed a final deadline in 2015, NMELC and NukeWatch
filed a complaint in federal district on May 13, 2016. The complaint 
concerns 12 failures by the Lab to comply with the 2005 Consent Order.
The lawsuit, filed in May against the Department of Energy and 
operators of the Lab, asks the Judge to require LANL to comply with 
the 2005 deadlines on a “reasonable but aggressive schedule,” and to
impose a civil penalty not to exceed $37,500 per day for each violation. 
See nmelc.org for the NukeWatch's amended complaint, which addresses LANL's 
2016 Consent Order.
Closing the Discharge Loophole 
Client: Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety
Co-Counsel: Lindsay Lovejoy 
Process: Petition to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EP A)
Although it has a discharge permit, no waste has come through the
“Outfall 051” at the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility (RLWTF)
since 2010. Yet the Lab is adamant about keeping a discharge permit for a
nonexistent discharge. Why?
The current discharge permit exempts the Lab from state and federal 
hazardous waste laws that have stringent provisions to guarantee public
hearings and access to documents. 
Under the current scheme, the New Mexico Environment Department
(NMED) Secretary can deny public hearings for major changes, and the
public cannot access documents until after permits are considered. 
In June, we petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
rescind the Outfall 051 discharge permit; a decision by the EPA
Administrator is subject to an internal appeal by whichever party does not
prevail. The law is clear: the EPA cannot regulate a nonexistent discharge.
If we win, the Lab will have to obtain a hazardous waste permit for both
the old and new RLWTFs. Our client and its members hope that this will
finally give residents of affected communities the right to be heard on
major changes at the RLWTF.

2016 Consent Order:
If  Y ou Aren’t Winning,
Change the Rules
The U.S. Department of Energy,
New Mexico Environment
Department (NMED), University
of California (LANL operator in
2005) and the state Attorney
General signed the original
“Compliance Order on Consent”
(Consent Order) in 2005. It lists
specific milestones and deadlines
for cleanup of legacy waste and
reporting at the Lab, and required
a final report on cleanup on
December 6, 2015. 
The Lab was privatized in 2006;
Governor Martinez was inaugurated
in 2011. Deadlines from the 2005
Consent Order loomed, were
extended, extended again, and
finally ignored. 
Rather than hold the Lab 
accountable for these failures,
NMED wrote a new draft Consent
Order, unveiled in 2016. The new
Consent Order, signed in July,
abolishes hard deadlines, replacing
them with targets that would be
negotiated each year through a
closed process between NMED,
the Department of Energy and the
Lab operator. The new Order also
gives the Department of Energy
and LANL significant room to
assert that “any particular ‘cleanup
objective is impracticable.’” 
NMED did not hold public hearings
on the 2016 Consent Order, or confer
with public-interest groups that
have been heavily invested for
decades in obtaining more effective
cleanup at the Lab. 
30 years after first proposing the Crownpoint Uranium Project, 
Uranium Resources, Inc. (URI) has walked away from its plans mine 
uranium in the Diné (Navajo) towns of Crownpoint and Church Rock. 
NMELC has represented the Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium 
Mining (ENDAUM) in this case for nearly 20 years.
In April 2016, URI sold out to Laramide Resources, an undercapitalized 
“junior” company that has never produced uranium. Eric Jantz, lead
NMELC attorney on the case, quickly wrote to the Environmental
Protection Agency to request that the agency rescind a groundwater 
pollution permit granted to URI’s subsidiary in 1989.
This letter follows on a December victory for NMELC and ENDAUM,
when NMED Secretary Ryan Flynn was forced to terminate a critical 
state-level groundwater pollution permit for the site. 
“There has been more than two decades of unrelenting opposition from 
ENDAUM, whose members are residents of these communities,” says 
Jantz. “Their opposition, combined with our legal challenges, is protecting
the air, water and lands from companies like URI and Laramide. These
companies are looking to profit at the expense of those who live there,
and who already deal with contamination left from the Cold War 
mining era. A huge thank you to our members for helping us stay in 
this fight until the end!” 
NMELC Staff Attorney Eric Jantz has worked with
ENDAUM to fight proposed uranium mining in 
Diné communities since 2001.
Uranium Resources Sells Out
With help from Law Center supporters,
NMELC and ENDAUM press advantage to stop 
the Crownpoint Uranium Project for good.
Laramide does not appear to have
the financial resources necessary to
conduct adequate or even cursory
groundwater restoration should it
begin mining [in Church Rock].
According to Laramide’s last 
available financial statement 
(4th quarter, 2015) Laramide had
working capital of only $103,891
and accumulated losses of over 
$90 million.

Case Up dates
4 ww w. nmelc.org
 29  Years of En vironmental and Community Victories       5
Santolina developers failed in
their first gambits to dismiss our
appeals of “Level A Approvals”
and a zoning change for the 
massive proposed development.
These appeals are in response to
the Bernalillo County Co mm ission’s
first round of approvals for the
development in June, 2015.
At a hearing in April, Developer,
Western Albuquerque Land
Holdings (WALH) advocated to
state District Court Judge Nancy
Franchini that our clients lacked
standing and that the case was not
yet ripe for hearing. They even
included a lengthy explanation
(backed up by a technical report and maps) about how our clients’ lives will not be impacted by Santolina
because they would not be able to “see the rooftops” of homes built at the development. 
Fortunately, Judge Franchini did not accept most of WALH’s arguments, and ruled that five of our six clients
have standing and that four of our five claims are ripe and will be considered. SouthWest Organizing Project
(SWOP), Pajarito Village Association and three individuals will continue the case; our client NM Health
Equity W orking Group was dismissed as an appellant.
In June, WALH launched another assault against our appeal. (WALH also 
challenged an appeal by other Albuquerque residents who are represented 
by a private attorney; the developer was successful in knocking down 
portions of their appeal, but not all of it.) We look forward to moving past 
its latest motion, so that the Judge can consider our arguments that 
Santolina has not demonstrated: 
• where it will obtain its “wet” water;
• that it can be built at no net expense to taxpayers;
• that it can attract the 100,000 jobs that it promises; and
• that enthusiastic support from Bernalillo County Commissioner  
Art De La Cruz (stretching back to before the public hearing) 
did not deprive our clients of a fair hearing.
WALH also is working to push 
“Level B Approvals” through the 
county process in 2016. 
Check our website for the 
latest developments.
Santolina Developer loses bid to kick out NMELC clients
Paul Hultin
The Law Center is very fortunate
to count Paul Hultin as not only a
donor but a key volunteer.
Paul has had an illustrious career as
an attorney, having practiced now for
more than 40 years as a civil trial lawyer in 
a broad range of complex commercial litigation.
He practiced most of his career in Colorado and was a founding partner
of Denver-based Wheeler Trigg O’Donnell, the largest civil trial and
appellate firm in the Mountain West. For the past 25 years, however,
Paul says he did more work outside Colorado than in, trying cases in 
13 different states and appearing as counsel of record in 35 states.
Paul had always loved Santa Fe, and had purchased property here for a
future move. Then, through a mutual friend, he met the Santa Fe artist
who would become his wife, Vicki Laszlo. That sped up the process a
bit, and Paul moved to Santa Fe full-time in 2012.
In the meantime, through another set-up, he was introduced to the Law
Center, and another kind of partnership began. One of his oldest friends
in Colorado introduced Paul to Dale Pontius, a former Law Center
Board member. When Dale mentioned the Law Center, Paul’s interest
was piqued. He had always done pro bono work, and wanted to get
involved in such work in New Mexico. He had already taken and passed
the New Mexico bar. So Dale introduced Paul to Doug Meiklejohn.
The first case that came up was Aquifer Science v. Verhines, a case
involving an attempted groundwater appropriation by a California-
based water speculator that was being handled by former Law Center
attorney Bruce Frederick. Paul had an interest in water law because it’s
such an important issue in the West. Right before the hearing started,
Bruce and Doug asked Paul if he wanted to assist. He did, and is still
lending his experience and expertise to the case. After we won the issue
before the State Engineer, the company appealed the decision to District
Court in Bernalillo County, with an August 2017 trial date now set.
As icing on the cake, Paul and Vicki helped fund the matching gift
amount for the Law Center’s recent Match Madness campaign.

THE INTERNATIONAL SALVADOR DAL Í  EXPERT
Michelle is a big picture thinker. Working with clients who sometimes get
stuck in the weeds of running socially-conscious businesses and non-profits,
she has a knack for helping people see the big picture through her Santa Fe-
based marketing and design firm, BrandNature. 
“I think people come to activism because of personal experience. Something
in their world has awakened them.”
Her awakening came in south Florida in the late 1980s. She was a partner in
a successful advertising agency, and an avid lover of the outdoors. But her
career and her love of nature grew discordant as she attended rallies to 
protect the Everglades on personal time, then worked for real estate developer
clients on the job. With the death of her mother, she began to question our
country’s food systems, changes in agriculture and land use, and their
affects on our health and ecosystems. Something had to give, and in 1998,
Michelle sought out a new place and a new way to do business…
to the benefit of New Mexico.
“I became aware of a movement where entrepreneurs were growing their
enterprises as agents for doing good in the world, for being profitable while
innovating solutions to social and environmental problems. ‘Triple Bottom
Line’ has become the business term for strategies designed to benefit people
and the planet, while delivering sustainable profits. It’s an approach that
values the people associated with an organization, inside and out, as much
as the product itself.” 
Seeing this emerging business sector, Michelle was inspired to transform
her brand strategy and design experience to serve cause-based organizations
and businesses. She founded Grace Communications [the predecessor to
BrandNature] with this mission in mind.
“I came to realize for triple bottom line models to succeed, leaders needed to
think, plan and communicate like an ecosystem. We help organizations value
—and grow the wisdom in their own systems. Waste less. Connect more dots.
Think of their team, suppliers and customers as a community – and how
one aspect supports the next.”
The Law Center was fortunate to meet Michelle in 2008, introduced by
Sebia Hawkens. While we are thrilled that BrandNature designs our Green
Fire Reports, we’re even more grateful for the hundreds of hours Michelle
and her colleagues have donated to us to connect more dots and value our
wisdom, with the goal of improving how we communicate our work in 
the world.
Thank you, Michelle!
“I’ve worked with many
non-profits over the last
29 years – but none as
selfless, efficient or
more committed than the
Law Center. That you
are so effective with the
amount of resources you
have is humbling.
The mostly gratis legal
representation you 
provide communities
is critically important
for people who otherwise
wouldn ’t have a voice
in our state.”
Green Business Partner Spotlight
The Law Center is thrilled to
announce that two passionate
advocates for social and 
environmental justice joined our
Board of Directors this summer.
Ramón Padilla, Jr. is an Educator at
Alma d'Arte Charter School in Las
Cruces and teaches at New Mexico
State University; previously he worked
as a Youth/Community Organizer with
the Doña Ana County Colonias
Development Council (a Law Center
client). Juan Reynosa is a Field Organizer
at the SouthWest Organizing Project
(SWOP), where his job includes working
with the Law Center on our Bernalillo
County air quality cases, the Kirtland
Air Force Base jet fuel spill, and the
Santolina sprawl case.

clients on the job. With the death of her mother, she began to question our
country’s food systems, changes in agriculture and land use, and their
affects on our health and ecosystems. Something had to give, and in 1998,
Michelle sought out a new place and a new way to do business…
to the benefit of New Mexico.
“I became aware of a movement where entrepreneurs were growing their
enterprises as agents for doing good in the world, for being profitable while
innovating solutions to social and environmental problems. ‘Triple Bottom
Line’ has become the business term for strategies designed to benefit people
and the planet, while delivering sustainable profits. It’s an approach that
values the people associated with an organization, inside and out, as much
as the product itself.” 
Seeing this emerging business sector, Michelle was inspired to transform
her brand strategy and design experience to serve cause-based organizations
and businesses. She founded Grace Communications [the predecessor to
BrandNature] with this mission in mind.
“I came to realize for triple bottom line models to succeed, leaders needed to
think, plan and communicate like an ecosystem. We help organizations value
—and grow the wisdom in their own systems. Waste less. Connect more dots.
Think of their team, suppliers and customers as a community – and how
one aspect supports the next.”
The Law Center was fortunate to meet Michelle in 2008, introduced by
Sebia Hawkens. While we are thrilled that BrandNature designs our Green
Fire Reports, we’re even more grateful for the hundreds of hours Michelle
and her colleagues have donated to us to connect more dots and value our
wisdom, with the goal of improving how we communicate our work in 
the world.
Thank you, Michelle!
“I’ve worked with many
non-profits over the last
29 years – but none as
selfless, efficient or
more committed than the
Law Center. That you
are so effective with the
amount of resources you
have is humbling.
The mostly gratis legal
representation you 
provide communities
is critically important
for people who otherwise
wouldn ’t have a voice
in our state.”

Did you know you can make a gift to the Law Center in your will?
Hazardous low-level and transuranic waste
remains at sites around the sprawling campus
of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL),
impacting water and air quality. Staff
Attorney Jon Block continues to work
closely with advocates to pursue legal
solutions to improving cleanup and to
ensure that members of local communities
have a meaningful role in decision-making.
So far this year, his work has involved two
major cases. Support from Law Center
members makes it possible for us to 
take on important cases like these.

2 New Campaigns for Better Cleanup at LANL
With the help of its members, the Law Center continues to help local groups mount
legal fights for meaningful cleanup at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).
“LANL has been hiding behind the wastewater treatment unit exemption for nearly six 
years,”  explains Joni Arends of CCNS. “In order to protect our health and environment 
and to provide transparency in its regulatory efforts, it is time for EPA to terminate 
Outfall 051 from the LANL discharge permit.”  – Joni Arends, CCNS executive director
