WE, THE PEOPLE OF COLOR, gathered together at this multinational People of Color Environmental Leadership 
Summit, to begin to build a national and international movement of all peoples of color to fight the destruction and taking of 
our lands and communities, do hereby re-establish our spiritual interdependence to the sacredness of our Mother Earth; to 
respect and celebrate each of our cultures, languages and beliefs about the natural world and our roles in healing ourselves; to 
ensure environmental justice; to promote economic alternatives which would contribute to the development of 
environmentally safe livelihoods; and, to secure our political, economic and cultural liberation that has been denied for over 
500 years of colonization and oppression, resulting in the poisoning of our communities and land and the genocide of our 
peoples, do affirm and adopt these Principles of Environmental Justice:  
The Principles of Environmental Justice (EJ) 
1) Environmental Justice  affirms the sacredness of 
Mother Earth, ecological unity and the interdependence of 
all species, and the right to be free from ecological 
destruction.  
2) Environmental Justice  demands that public policy be 
based on mutual respect and justice for all peoples, free 
from any form of discrimination or bias.  
3) Environmental Justice  mandates the right to ethical, 
balanced and responsible uses of land and renewable 
resources in the interest of a sustainable planet for humans 
and other living things.  
4) Environmental Justice  calls for universal protection 
from nuclear testing, extraction, production and disposal 
of toxic/hazardous wastes and poisons and nuclear testing 
that threaten the fundamental right to clean air, land, 
water, and food.  
5) Environmental Justice  affirms the fundamental right 
to political, economic, cultural and environmental self-
determination of all peoples.  
6) Environmental Justice  demands the cessation of the 
production of all toxins, hazardous wastes, and radioactive 
materials, and that all past and current producers be held 
strictly accountable to the people for detoxification and 
the containment at the point of production.  
7) Environmental Justice  demands the right to 
participate as equal partners at every level of decision-
making, including needs assessment, planning, 
implementation, enforcement and evaluation.  
8) Environmental Justice  affirms the right of all workers 
to a safe and healthy work environment without being 
forced to choose between an unsafe livelihood and 
unemployment. It also affirms the right of those who work 
at home to be free from environmental hazards.  
9) Environmental Justice  protects the right of victims of 
environmental injustice to receive full compensation and 
reparations for damages as well as quality health care.  
10) Environmental Justice  considers governmental acts 
of environmental injustice a violation of international law, 
the Universal Declaration On Human Rights, and the 
United Nations Convention on Genocide.  
11) Environmental Justice  must recognize a special legal 
and natural relationship of Native Peoples to the U.S. 
government through treaties, agreements, compacts, and 
covenants affirming sovereignty and self-determination.  
12) Environmental Justice  affirms the need for urban 
and rural ecological policies to clean up and rebuild our 
cities and rural areas in balance with nature, honoring the 
cultural integrity of all our communities, and provided fair 
access for all to the full range of resources.  
13) Environmental Justice  calls for the strict 
enforcement of principles of informed consent, and a halt 
to the testing of experimental reproductive and medical 
procedures and vaccinations on people of color.  
14) Environmental Justice  opposes the destructive 
operations of multi-national corporations.  
15) Environmental Justice  opposes military occupation, 
repression and exploitation of lands, peoples and cultures, 
and other life forms.  
16) Environmental Justice  calls for the education of 
present and future generations which emphasizes social 
and environmental issues, based on our experience and an 
appreciation of our diverse cultural perspectives.  
17) Environmental Justice  requires that we, as 
individuals, make personal and consumer choices to 
consume as little of Mother Earth's resources and to 
produce as little waste as possible; and make the 
conscious decision to challenge and reprioritize our 
lifestyles to ensure the health of the natural world for 
present and future generations.

Delegates to  the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit held on October 24 -27, 1991, in 
Washington DC, drafted and adopted these 17 principles of Environmental Justice.  Since then, the Principles have served 
as a defining document for the grow ing grassroots movement for environmental justice.
