W ithout our m em bers, w e never could have challenged the U .S. A ir Force to do a better job cleaning up 
its m assive K irtland jet fuel spill in A lbuquerque.  
Plum es of toxic and carcinogenic contam ination (see diagram below) are m oving tow ards 
A lbuquerque’s R idgecrest drinking w ater w ells – the plum e of ethlyne dibrom ide (EBD ) is less than 
a m ile from  the w ellfield. A nd though the A ir Force and the N ew  M exico Environm ent D epartm ent 
(N M ED ) have know n about the spill for 1 6  years, they have little to show  for it, as illustrated by the 
fact that estim ates the size of the spill range from  about 5  m illion gallons (A ir Force) to 24 m illion 
gallons (N M ED ). 
By law , w e’re required to file a notice of intent to sue the U .S. A ir Force and the D epartm ent of D efense. 
If the A ir Force does not change its slow -m oving strategy in the next 90 days, w e w ill go to federal 
court to advocate for a m ore effective cleanup w ith enforceable deadlines. 
The Law  C enter represents the SouthW est O rganizing Project, State Senator C isco M cSorley, State 
Senator M im i Stew art, and several local residents. W e w ill keep you apprised of this very im portant case.

BREAKIN G N EW S 
From  the K irtland A FB  Fuel Spill C leanup Strategic Plan Proposed for 2015. (not to scale) 
A ccording to press accounts over the past year, it sounds like the A ir Force and 
the N ew  M exico Environm ent D epartm ent (N M ED ) are w orking to clean up the spill. 
So w hy are the Law  C enter and its clients getting involved? 
The A ir Force and N M ED  have been studying the spill for 1 6  years and spent $ 90 m illion, yet 
little has been done to show  for it – they don’t even know  how  m any m illions of gallons w ere 
spilled. C urrently there is only one extraction w ell at w ork rem oving the ethylene dibrom ide 
(ED B) from  groundw ater, w ith plans for tw o m ore this year an d
four next year – that’s just not enough. If you look at the Strategic 
Plan presented by the A ir Force and N M ED , it calls for tw o 
decades of additional studies before getting into full-scale 
rem ediation. In the m eanw hile, the contam ination w ill continue 
to spread. 
If things continue along the w ay they’ve been going, w hat 
could happen? 
R em em ber: this is one of the m ost significant w ater problem s 
that the C ity of A lbuquerque has ever faced. The contam inants 
that are in this leak can cause cancer and have been linked to 
birth defects – w hen they reach the R idgecrest w ellfield in levels 
that can be detected, the C ity w ill have to shut dow n those 
w ells. W e and our clients believe that there are w ays to speed up 
the cleanup and reduce the risk that this drinking w ater source 
w ill have to be abandoned. 
W hat specifically are you looking to do? 
The Law  C enter and our clients have one goal: to protect as 
m uch drinking w ater as possible for A lbuquerque’s current and 
future residents. That requires a critical piece of the puzzle that 
currently is lacking from  the plan put together by the A ir Force 
and N M ED : an enforceable schedule. O ur law suit w ill ask a 
judge to order A ir Force to adopt a plan that w ill jum pstart 
m eaningful rem ediation, w ith m ilestones and deadlines that 
trigger consequences w hen they are m issed. That does not 
exist today – and it show s.
