newsletter is recycled
At this moment in time, it seems like the world is exceptionally unsettled.  
Our nation is undergoing a long overdue reckoning with systemic racism 
that has oppressed and marginalized communities of color since this 
country’s inception.  Black Lives Matter and others are forcing White 
America to confront its past and the status quo. This is just the beginning 
of the hard process of building a truly equitable and inclusive society.  
We’re still in the grip of a global pandemic that has changed everyone’s 
“normal.”  What under the best of circumstances would be a very difficult 
situation is made exponentially worse by inept federal leadership.  
And alarmingly – although predictably - the pandemic has provided an 
opening for profiteering and wide ranging corruption.  The Trump adminis-
tration has used the pandemic as an excuse to suspend enforcement of 
environmental laws and to give away our tax dollars to corporate cronies.  
Events at the New Mexico Environmental Law Center are paralleling 
national and global events.  We continue our internal work to make the Law 
Center a more equitable, diverse and inclusive organization.  
We are also adapting to a new “normal” at the office.  Law Center staff has 
adapted to virtual meetings and a remote work environment.  We will 
continue to adapt as New Mexico and the country slowly begin to re-open.  
Despite all the turmoil around us, our commitment to New Mexico remains 
constant.  The Law Center continues to work with communities to ensure 
that all New Mexicans have the clean air, land and water that we are 
entitled to.  Our staff and members stepped up to get supplies to commu-
nities in McKinley County hit hard by COVID.  We continue to work with 
communities to hold state and federal governments accountable to their 
commitments to protect natural resources and public health.  And we will 
continue to fight any efforts to use the pandemic to further oppress and 
marginalize communities that are already disproportionally impacted by 
pollution.  
We thank all our members, supporters and partners for standing with us 
during these difficult times and look forward to continuing our work for 
environmental and social justice.  
In solidarity, 
Eric Jantz, Interim Executive Director
Dear Friends,

GREEN BUSINESS PARTNERS
When Donald Trump announced in 
January that he wanted the 
“cleanest air” and “cleanest water” 
no one really believed him.  But the 
breathtaking cynicism of his 
comments cannot truly be 
appreciated until his 
administration’s record is reviewed. 
During Trump’s first 100 days, 23 
environmental rules were rolled 
back. Since 2017, there have been 
a total of 64 environmental policy 
rollbacks with 34 still pending as 
documented by The New York 
Times. It’s staggering to 
contemplate the immense and, in 
some cases, irreversible damage 
done to the environment by these 
actions. 
Rollbacks Affecting New Mexico:
> Revoked a rule that prevented 
coal mining companies from 
dumping debris into local streams. 
> Canceled a requirement for 
reporting methane emissions.
> Revoked an update to public 
land use planning process.
> Rejected a ban on a potentially 
harmful insecticide, Chlorpyrifos.
> Withdrew guidance for federal 
agencies to include greenhouse 
gas emissions in environmental 
reviews.
> Ordered review and 
“elimination” of rule that protected 
tributaries and wetlands under the 
Clean Water Act.
> Rolled back limits on toxic 
discharge from power plants into 
public waterways.
> Ordered review of rule limiting 
methane emissions at new oil and 
gas drilling sites.
> Revoked limits on methane 
emissions on public lands.
> Delayed a lawsuit over a rule 
regulating airborne mercury 
emissions from power plants.
“THE CLEANEST AIR, 
THE CLEANEST 
WATER”: TRUMP'S 
ASSAULT ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT

The Law Center currently has 25 cases 
on the docket. 
Red Water Pond Road 
Because the U.S. EPA has suspended 
all field operations during the 
pandemic, uranium mine cleanup at the 
Red Water Pond Road community has 
stalled.  However, both the EPA and 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
continue to evaluate General Electric’s 
plan to dispose of waste from the 
Northeast Churchrock mine at another 
GE owned superfund site less than a 
mile away from the community. 
Copper Flat Mine
In an unexpected but welcome 
development, the Mining and Minerals 
Division rescinded its earlier approval 
of the Copper Flat mine permit 
application. MMD determined that 
before New Mexico Copper Corp.’s 
mine permit could be considered 
complete, it must show that it has 
sufficient water rights to support 
production and complete mine 
reclamation. Mine development will not 
go forward until the operator can 
prove the necessary water rights.  
Kirtland AFB
On February 4, the Law Center sued 
the U.S. Air Force on behalf of our 
clients seeking to force cleanup of a 
PAUL RUDD, 47, passed away suddenly in 
New York in April.
Son of Mark Rudd and step-son of Marla 
Painter, Paul was very committed to justice 
which he demonstrated in his life and work.  
Mark and Marla, who are steadfast Law Center 
supporters, said Paul would want his work 
carried on. We will honor Paul’s memory by 
continuing to support and work with 
communities struggling for equality and 
justice. Paul was co-chair at the Roosevelt 
Institute, working alongside the 
granddaughter of Eleanor and Franklin.
DALE PONTIUS, 1940-2020
Dale passed away on February 3, 2020 after a 
long and courageous battle with Alzheimer's 
disease. Dale never boasted of his amazing 
accomplishments, of which there were many. 
His desire to preserve and protect the 
environment through political process was 
unwavering and inspiring. 
Dale was particularly proud of his work on 
developing the groundwater law for the state 
of Arizona in an effort to curb overuse, and on 
the Land Use and Resource Conservation Act 
of 1975, co-sponsored by Congressman Morris 
Udall. Dale retired from public service as an 
Associate Solicitor for the Department of the 
Interior in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Dale served as president of the Board of the 
Law Center in 2007. “When I came to the Law 
Center as a young lawyer, Dale was a huge 
source of encouragement and guidance. I’ll 
always be grateful for that,” Eric Jantz, Interim 
Executive Director.
groundwater contamination plume that is 
threatening several of Albuquerque’s 
municipal drinking water wells. The U.S. 
Air Force filed a motion to dismiss our 
clients’ federal lawsuit. On our clients’ 
behalf, we opposed the motion to 
dismiss and the motion will be heard by 
Judge William Browning on July 21.

Due to the pandemic, progress on the 
mediation with the City of Albuquerque 
Environmental Health Department and 
Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Air 
Quality Control Board on the disparate 
treatment of communities of color with 
respect to air pollution has stalled. Law 
Center staff is currently discussing ways 
forward with our clients.

On June 2nd, the New Mexico 
Public Health Association issued a 
statement calling on its members 
and supporters to act to address 
the “public health crisis of systemic 
racism.” As an organization that 
routinely sees how disparate 
implementation and enforcement 
of environmental laws impact 
communities of color, the Law 
Center without reservation 
endorses and supports the 
NMPHA’s announcement.
Dear NMPHA Members and 
Supporters,
We write to you today in sorrow, 
anger, and heartbreak. As many of 
you already know, George Floyd 
was murdered by police officers in 
Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. The 
New Mexico Public Health 
Association (NMPHA) offers our 
sincerest condolences to the family 
and friends of George Floyd. 
Again, we see the devastating 
impact of violence perpetrated by 
law enforcement upon the lives 
and well-being of people of color.
As the leading independent voice 
for public health in New Mexico, 
we cannot and will not remain 
silent. We will say their names. 
George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, 
Breonna Taylor, Sandra Bland, Eric 
Garner, Trayvon Martin, Philando 
Castile, Tony McDade, Freddie 
Gray, Michael Brown, and so many 
more. Countless people of color in 
the United States are killed at the 
hands of police officers every year. 
This is a public health crisis and the 
time to act is now.
We join with the American Public 
Health Association in recognizing 
that, “Racism is a longstanding 
systemic structure in this country 
that must be dismantled, through 
brutally honest conversations, 
THE PUBLIC HEALTH 
CRISIS OF SYSTEMIC 
RACISM
policy changes and practices. 
Racism attacks people’s physical 
and mental health….We see 
discrimination every day in all 
aspects of life, including housing, 
education, the criminal justice 
system and employment. And it is 
amplified during this pandemic as 
communities of color face 
inequities in everything from a 
greater burden of COVID-19 cases 
to less access to testing, treatment 
and care.”
We call on our members and 
supporters -- students, doctors, 
nurses, community health workers, 
community organizers, professors 
-- health experts from across the 
Land of Enchantment to rise up 
and act today to address the public 
health crisis of systemic racism. We 
have the power and the tools 
necessary to transform New 
Mexico into a place where health 
equity is the norm. Regardless of 
the color of our skin, our gender 
and sexuality, our immigration 
status, or the places we call home, 
each of us must have the 
opportunity to be as healthy as 
possible. We must act today 
because our lives depend on it.
You can find resources we have 
compiled on racism’s detrimental 
impact on health, police violence, 
and so much more on our website, 
nmpha.org. Join us in working to 
ensure the safety and well-being of 
our fellow New Mexicans.
Sincerely,
