   September  12,  2025   Via  email:  michelle@newmexicansformichelle.com   Re:   Urgent  call  to  halt  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory’s  Saturday,  September  13,  2025   tritium  venting    Governor  Lujan  Grisham:   This  letter  serves  as  an  urgent  call  to  halt  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory’s  (LANL)  proposed  
tritium
 
venting
 
scheduled
 
to
 
begin
 
tomorrow,
 
September
 
13,
 
2025
.
 
Given
 
your
 
strong
 
commitment
 
to
 
the
 
health
 
and
 
well-being
 
of
 
New
 
Mexico’s
 
children,
 
most
 
recently
 
demonstrated
 
through
 
your
 
initiative
 
to
 
guarantee
 
no-cost
 
universal
 
child
 
care
 
to
 
all
 
New
 
Mexicans
  
–
 
we
 
urge
 
you
 
to
 
act
 
quickly
 
to
 
protect
 
children
 
who
 
stand
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
most
 
impacted
 
by
 
LANL’s
 
actions
 
this
 
weekend.
 
  As  you  know,  tritium  is  a  highly  radioactive  isotope  of  ordinary,  non-radioactive  hydrogen.  
Given
 
its
 
structure,
 
tritium
 
bonds
 
very
 
easily
 
to
 
water,
 
creating
 
a
 
vapor
 
that
 
is
 
highly
 
absorbable
 
by
 
the
 
human
 
body,
 
pervading
 
every
 
cell.
 
Tritium
 
can
 
be
 
very
 
dangerous
 
if
 
inhaled
 
and
 
has
 
been
 
shown
 
to
 
cause
 
cancer,
 
genetic
 
mutations
 
and
 
birth
 
defects.
 
The
 
amount
 
of
 
tritium
 
LANL
 
proposes
 
to
 
vent
 
is
 
three-times
 
more
 
tritium
 
than
 
would
 
be
 
dumped
 
into
 
the
 
Pacific
 
Ocean
 
from
 
the
 
Fukushima
 
nuclear
 
power
 
plant
 
in
 
Japan
 
over
 
the
 
course
 
of
 
thirty
 
years.
 
  Notably,  the  dose  to  an  infant  from  tritiated  water  vapor  is  estimated  to  be  over  three  times  
greater
 
than
 
the
 
dose
 
to
 
any
 
adult
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
exposed
 
on
 
Saturday.
 
LANL
 
has
 
never
 
considered
 
the
 
impacts
 
to
 
children
 
from
 
this
 
project.
 
  Rather  than  address  LANL’s  gross  mismanagement  of  its  nuclear  waste,  the  New  Mexico  
Environment
 
Department,
 
just
 
a
 
few
 
days
 
ago,
 
made
 
a
 
rushed
 
and
 
reckless
 
decision
 
to
 
authorize
 
LANL’s
 
venting,
 
regardless
 
of
 
the
 
uncertainty,
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
adequate
 
infrastructure
 
to
 
notify
 
the
 
public
 
in
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
an
 
emergency,
 
and
 
LANL’s
 
disregard
 
for
 
the
 
impacts
 
of
 
creating
 
contaminated
 
rain
 
water,
 
even
 
in
 
the
 
face
 
of
 
rain
 
forecasted
 
for
 
Saturday
 
afternoon.
 
  As  the  state’s  only  exclusively  environmental-justice  focused  law  center,  the  New  Mexico  
Environmental
 
Law
 
Center
 
has
 
been
 
engaging
 
with
 
communities
 
impacted
 
by
 
LANL’s
 
toxic
 
legacy
 
for
 
over
 
three
 
decades.
 
NMED’s
 
most
 
recent
 
decision
 
only
 
perpetuates
 
the
 
same
 
environmental
 
and
 
cultural
 
violence
 
LANL
 
has
 
inflicted
 
upon
 
communities
 
since
 
LANL’s
 
1  

  creation.  We  are  calling  on  you  to  do  the  right  thing  for  New  Mexico’s  children  and  put  a  stop  to  
LANL’s
 
upcoming
 
tritium
 
venting.
 
  Respectfully,
