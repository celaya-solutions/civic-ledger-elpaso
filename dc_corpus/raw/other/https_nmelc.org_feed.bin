<p class="p2"><b>Re: Request for Adequate Public Notice – Acoma LLC Permit Applications </b></p>
<p class="p2">Dear New Mexico Environment Department:</p>
<p class="p2">Thank you for your response to our December 12 letter, attached, expressing initial interest in Acoma, LLC’s two air pollution permit applications for the following facilities related to Project Jupiter:</p>
<p class="p2">West Microgrid: latitude 31.82333 dec deg North and longitude -106.713056 dec deg West,</p>
<p class="p2">approximately 4.1 miles southwest of Santa Teresa in Doña Ana County.</p>
<p class="p2">East Microgrid: latitude 31.818333 dec deg North and longitude -106.679167 dec deg West,</p>
<p class="p2">Approximately 3.6 miles south of Santa Teresa in Doña Ana County.</p>
<p class="p2">While we appreciate that the Department intends to post Acoma, LLC’s redacted applications to the NMED Website by 12/17/2025, we strongly urge notice of the complete applications be broadly disseminated, in both English and Spanish, at physical locations in the impacted communities of Sunland Park and Santa Teresa, due to the important and significant public interest in this microgrid power plant project and its associated Project Jupiter. In addition, community members often do not have reliable internet access, and many may not know to check the Department’s website. Thus, we request notice of the administratively complete applications be posted, along with instructions for public participation, in English and Spanish in the following locations. &#8230;</p>

Re: Urgent call to halt Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Saturday, September 13, 2025 

tritium venting 

Governor Lujan Grisham:

This letter serves as an urgent call to halt Los Alamos National Laboratory’s (LANL) proposed tritium venting scheduled to begin tomorrow, September 13, 2025. Given your strong commitment to the health and well-being of New Mexico’s children, most recently demonstrated through your initiative to guarantee no-cost universal child care to all New Mexicans  – we urge you to act quickly to protect children who stand to be the most impacted by LANL’s actions this weekend. ]]></description>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re: </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Urgent call to halt Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Saturday, September 13, 2025 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">tritium venting </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Lujan Grisham:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This letter serves as an urgent call to halt Los Alamos National Laboratory’s (LANL) proposed tritium venting </span><b>scheduled to begin tomorrow, September 13, 2025</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Given your strong commitment to the health and well-being of New Mexico’s children, most recently demonstrated through your initiative to guarantee no-cost universal child care to all New Mexicans  – we urge you to act quickly to protect children who stand to be the most impacted by LANL’s actions this weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, tritium is a highly radioactive isotope of ordinary, non-radioactive hydrogen. Given its structure, tritium bonds very easily to water, creating a vapor that is highly absorbable by the human body, pervading every cell. Tritium can be very dangerous if inhaled and has been shown to cause cancer, genetic mutations and birth defects. The amount of tritium LANL proposes to vent is three-times more tritium than would be dumped into the Pacific Ocean from the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan over the course of thirty years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, the dose to an infant from tritiated water vapor is estimated to be over </span><b>three times greater</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the dose to any adult expected to be exposed on Saturday. LANL has never considered the impacts to children from this project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than address LANL’s gross mismanagement of its nuclear waste, the New Mexico Environment Department, just a few days ago, made a rushed and reckless decision to authorize LANL’s venting, regardless of the uncertainty, the lack of adequate infrastructure to notify the public in the event of an emergency, and LANL’s disregard for the impacts of creating contaminated rain water, even in the face of rain forecasted for Saturday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the state’s only exclusively environmental-justice focused law center, the New Mexico Environmental Law Center has been engaging with communities impacted by LANL’s toxic legacy for over three decades. NMED’s most recent decision only perpetuates the same environmental and cultural violence LANL has inflicted upon communities since LANL’s creation. We are calling on you to do the right thing for New Mexico’s children and put a stop to LANL’s upcoming tritium venting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respectfully,</span></p>

<p><strong>Santa Teresa Residents Challenge Misinformation about Water/Energy Consumption, Brackish Water &amp; Desalination Plants</strong></p>
<p><em>Sunland Park, NM—</em>Community members held up signs in opposition to water-guzzling data centers during a New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee meeting held in Sunland Park on Tuesday, August 19th, and in Las Cruces on Wednesday, August 20th. Messages such as “You Can’t Drink Data,” “Santa Teresa Needs Clean Drinking Water, Not Data Centers,” and “Water for People Not for a Data Center” created a contrasting backdrop to the many promises made by BorderPlex Digital CEO Lanham Napier and other boosters of the massive data center project proposed for Santa Teresa.</p>
<p>BorderPlex Digital Assets, LLC, is a part of a larger plan for development and exploitation of Southern New Mexico, and its “data infrastructure campus” proposed in Santa Teresa would include both data center facilities and brackish water desalination plants – which will place an enormous strain on the region’s power grid and water supply.</p>
<p>Santa Teresa and Sunland Park communities have been advocating for clean and safe drinking water for years, and now stand to lose access to their local water supply for the profit of a few. &#8230;</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Produced by Kent Paterson with Mercedes Mejia, this half-hour documentary examines historic and contemporary environmental and public health issues confronting the people of two southern New Mexico communities straddling the Mexican border: Sunland Park and Santa Teresa. Amid tremendous growth fueled by a burgeoning cross-border economy, residents grapple with drinking water quality, traffic issues and long-running concerns over a huge regional landfill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Part One of a series on pending environmental justice issues on the southern New Mexico border, this program features rare recordings of watershed moments in the economic development and socio-environmental history of the region, as well the contemporary voices of residents, officials and activists who are defining the present and future. This documentary was made possible in part by support from the Fund for Investigative Journalism and the McCune Charitable Foundation. Thanks also to the Raices Collective of KUNM.</p>
