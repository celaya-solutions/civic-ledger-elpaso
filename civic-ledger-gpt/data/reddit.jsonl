Though systematic celestial studies began later here than in ancient centers like Ujjain or Benares, Rajasthan emerged between the 16th and 18th centuries as one of India's most dynamic astronomical centers. The region's astronomical tradition features remarkable royal patronage, monumental observatories, creative synthesis of Hindu and Islamic systems, and practical handbooks serving astronomers across the subcontinent.\n\nThe astronomical heritage reflects Rajasthan's broader cultural landscape. The Rajput kingdoms—Bikaner, Jaipur (Amber), Jodhpur (Marwar), Udaipur (Mewar), and Kota—competed militarily, politically, and culturally. Rulers recognized that patronizing learning, including exact sciences, enhanced prestige and legitimacy. This produced astronomical flourishing supported by royal libraries, observatories, and scholar-astronomer communities enjoying material support and intellectual freedom.\n\nRajasthan's geographical position contributed significantly. Located at the crossroads between the Islamic cultural sphere and Hindu northern India, it became a natural site for astronomical synthesis. Muslim conquest and Mughal rule brought Islamic methods and instruments, while indigenous Hindu traditions remained strong under Rajput patronage. This creative tension produced remarkable developments in Indian astronomical history.\n\n# Early Astronomical Activity: The 16th Century\n\n# Caṇḍīḍāsa of Yodhapura (1518-1544)\n\nThe earliest known Rajasthani astronomer was Caṇḍīḍāsa, active in Yodhapura (modern Jodhpur) during the first half of the 16th century. He composed a commentary on chapters 1-8 of Bhāskara II's Karaṇakutūhala (Wonder of the Karaṇas), one of medieval India's most popular astronomical handbooks. His commentary provided worked examples dated between 1518 and 1544, demonstrating active teaching throughout this period.\n\nInterestingly, many manuscripts replace his missing commentary on chapters 9-10 with corresponding sections from Ekanātha's commentary (composed in Maharashtra around 1370). This integrated version was later revised in Kūṇṭhāsthāna (possibly modern Kota) by Dayāratna Muni, who provides examples from 1553-1559, suggesting an astronomical community in Kota by mid-16th century.\n\n# Jayavanta of Yodhapura (c. 1593)\n\nContinuing Caṇḍīḍāsa's tradition, Jayavanta wrote a commentary on Bhāskara's Karaṇakutūhala around 1593, apparently covering only the first two chapters dealing with mean planetary longitudes and corrections—essential computational procedures for practicing astronomers.\n\n# Rāmacandra Bhaṭṭa and Mahārāja Rāyasiṃha of Bikaner (c. 1599)\n\nThe earliest clear evidence of royal patronage comes from Bikaner, where Mahārāja Rāyasiṃha (reigned c. 1573-1610) commissioned astronomical work. Around 1599, Rāmacandra Bhaṭṭa composed the Karaṇakalpadruma (Wish-Fulfilling Tree of Karaṇas) under Rāyasiṃha's patronage. Remarkably, the mahārāja himself contributed additions to the work, exemplifying the philosopher-king ideal of Indo-Islamic court culture.\n\n# The Development of Cyclic Astronomical Tables: Innovation in Rajasthan\n\n# Harideva and Babylonian Cycles (c. 1610)\n\nAround 1610, Harideva produced a remarkable innovation: India's first cyclic planetary tables using Babylonian periods for annual predictions. His cycles were: Mars (79 years), Mercury (46 years), Jupiter (83 years), Venus (8 years × 9 = 72 years), and Saturn (59 years). These periods represent when each planet returns approximately to the same position.\n\nWhat makes Harideva's work significant is not the cycles themselves—known in India through Greek and Islamic sources—but his systematic application to create practical tables. Rather than calculating from first principles each time, astronomers could look up positions for a given year and make simple adjustments. He drew inspiration from Mahādeva's Mahādevī (1316), which pioneered \"true linear\" tables providing planetary longitudes at regular intervals.\n\n# Haridatta and the Jagadbhūṣaṇa (1638)\n\nFollowing Harideva, Haridatta compiled the Jagadbhūṣaṇa (Ornament of the World) in 1638, dedicated to Mahārāja Jagatsiṃha of Mewar (1628-1652). He adopted most of Harideva's cycles but changed Venus's period from 8 to 227 years, providing more accurate long-term predictions. Both followed the Brāhmapakṣa, indicating this traditional school remained influential in Rajasthan.\n\n# Trivikrama of Nalinapura (1704-1719)\n\nThe cyclic table tradition continued into the early 18th century with Trivikrama, who compiled the Bhramaṇasāriṇī (Tables of Revolution, epoch 1704), Śīghrasiddhi (1719), and Tithisāriṇī. The tradition's persistence over a century demonstrates that cyclic tables met real needs among practicing astronomers and almanac-makers, offering excellent compromise between accuracy and ease of use.\n\n# Commentaries on Classical Texts\n\n# Śrīpati's Makaranda Commentary (1611)\n\nIn 1611, Śrīpati composed a commentary on Bhāskara's Karaṇakutūhala entitled Makaranda (Bee's Honey). Almost certainly written in Rajasthan (all known manuscripts preserved there), this represents continued engagement with Bhāskara's influential text.\n\n# Sumatiharṣa Gaṇi and the Gaṇakakumudakaumudī (1621)\n\nA decade later, Jaina monk Sumatiharṣa Gaṇi composed the Gaṇakakumudakaumudī (Moonlight on the Water-Lilies of Calculators) in 1621. Written in Vindhyāvalī (modern Bijauliā, in Mewar), this reflects Jaina communities' important role in Rajasthan and Gujarat's intellectual life. Sumatiharṣa mentions his own gloss on Mahādeva's Mahādevī (now lost). His friend Dhanarāja completed the Mahādevīdīpikā (Light on the Mahādevī) at Padmāvatī (modern Pushkar) in 1635, revealing scholarly networks connecting regional astronomers.\n\n# The Reign of Anūpasiṃha: Bikaner as a Major Astronomical Center (1669-1698)\n\n# The Mahārāja as Patron and Collector\n\nThe most extraordinary 17th-century flowering resulted from Mahārāja Anūpasiṃha of Bikaner (1669-1698). His threefold contribution: patronizing working astronomers including appointing a court astronomer (jyotiṣarāja); tireless manuscript collecting from North and South India; and creating an exceptionally rich library serving as model for future collections.\n\nAnūpasiṃha's systematic manuscript collecting brought together works from different regional traditions and diverse astronomical schools, creating resources unmatched outside great monastic libraries. His library's importance for preserving Indian astronomical knowledge cannot be overstated—many texts survive only because copies were preserved in the Bikaner collection. When Jayasiṃha of Jaipur undertook astronomical projects, he took Anūpasiṃha's library as his model. Today, Rajasthan's libraries house India's largest astronomical manuscript collections, directly attributable to Anūpasiṃha's foundation.\n\n# Vīrasiṃha: The Jyotiṣarāja of Bikaner\n\nAnūpasiṃha's most important scholarly appointment was Vīrasiṃha as jyotiṣarāja. Born 1613 in Kheṭa (modern Gangakheir, Maharashtra), he came from an astronomical family—his great-grandfather Kṛṣṇadeva, grandfather Kāśīrāja, and father Ballāla were all astronomers of the Vasiṣṭhagotra lineage.\n\nBefore entering Bikaner's service, Vīrasiṃha composed: Kheṭaplava (1625), Camatkārasiddhi (1627—commissioned by Muslim patron Maḥmūd), and Āryasiddhāntatulyakaraṇa (1633). After becoming jyotiṣarāja, he continued productively: Anūpamahodadhi (1673-1680), Anūpakaraṇa, Pañcāṅgabhūṣaṇa, and Saurābharaṇa.\n\nVīrasiṃha's career illustrates 17th-century India's complex geography. Born and trained in Maharashtra, working for Hindu and Muslim patrons, eventually settling in Rajasthan at a Rajput court, he embodied India's learned elite's mobility and adaptability. His astronomical work drew on multiple traditions—familiar with Brāhmapakṣa and Āryapakṣa, understanding Islamic methods, working with different texts and tables.\n\n# The Reign of Sawai Jayasiṃha: Jaipur's Golden Age (1700-1743)\n\n# The Ruler as Astronomer\n\nThe most celebrated figure in Rajasthani astronomy was Mahārāja Sawai Jayasiṃha II of Amber (later Jaipur), ruling 1700-1743. In 1727, he founded Jayapura (Jaipur), which became 18th-century India's most important astronomical center.\n\nJayasiṃha's engagement was deeper than any Indian ruler in history. Unlike Anūpasiṃha (primarily patron and collector) or Rāyasiṃha (modest contributions), Jayasiṃha personally studied astronomy, commissioned translations and original works, built observatories, and sought reform by incorporating best knowledge from Indian, Islamic, and European sources.\n\n# The Observatories: Architecture in Service of Science\n\nJayasiṃha's most visible contribution was constructing five observatories (jantar mantar): Delhi (c. 1721-1724), Jaipur (1727), Ujjain, Mathura, and Benares. These were architectural constructions that were themselves astronomical instruments, built of stone and brick:\n\n* Samrāṭ yantra (Supreme Instrument): Enormous sundials with triangular gnomons, the largest (Jaipur) standing 27 meters high\n* Rāśivalaya yantra: Twelve structures representing zodiac signs\n* Jai Prakāś yantra (Light of Jai): Two hemispherical bowls with crosswires, invented by Jayasiṃha\n* Rām yantra: Cylindrical structures with central pillar\n* Miśra yantra: Various other instruments\n\nInspiration came partly from earlier Islamic observatories, particularly Ulugh Beg's in Samarkand (15th century). However, Jayasiṃha's masonry construction and architectural monumentality were distinctive. Their enormous scale allowed very precise measurements. The observatories primarily confirmed or contradicted parameters in various texts rather than generating entirely new theories. Nevertheless, they represent remarkable commitment to empirical observation and remain extraordinary monuments. The Jaipur and Delhi observatories are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n# Assembly of Scholars\n\nJayasiṃha gathered Hindu, Muslim, and European astronomers to produce an accurate Persian zīj for Mughal emperor Muhammad Shāh. This multicultural circle reflected 18th-century north India's reality, where Hindu and Islamic traditions coexisted and interacted.\n\n# Astronomical Works Attributed to Jayasiṃha\n\nSeveral works were composed in Jayasiṃha's name or under his patronage:\n\n* Yantrarājaracanāprakriyā: Describing astrolabe construction and use\n* Yantraprakāra: Describing masonry observatory instruments\n* Sūryasiddhāntasāravicāra: Commenting on Sūryasiddhānta sections\n* Jayavinodasāriṇī (1735): Tables for preparing pañcāṅgas\n* Zīj-i Muhammad Shāhī: Comprehensive Persian zīj (with Sanskrit translation) incorporating data from multiple sources\n\n# Translation Projects\n\nJayasiṃha sponsored extensive translation from Arabic and Persian into Sanskrit, reversing the earlier pattern (Sanskrit to Arabic, 8th-10th centuries).\n\nNayanasukhopādhyāya (with Muhammad Ābidda's assistance) produced 1729 translations:\n\n* Ukāra: Theodosius's Spherics\n* Śarahatajkara varjandī: Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī's Tadhkira section with Barjandī's commentary\n* Possibly Yantrarājavicāra (Naṣīr al-Dīn's astrolabe treatise) and Sarvadeśīyajarakālīyantra (al-Zarqāllu's universal astrolabe work)\n\nJagannātha Paṇḍita, Jayasiṃha's teacher, translated:\n\n* Rekhāgaṇita (1727 or earlier): Euclid's Elements\n* Samrāṭsiddhānta (1732): Ptolemy's Almagest\n* Composed Siddhāntakaustubha: Compendium summarizing astronomical researches (versions from c. 1727, 1730, c. 1732)\n\nAn anonymous collaborator translated:\n\n* Vakramārgavicāra: Section on planetary retrograde motions from Jamshīd al-Kāshī's Zīj-i Khāqānī\n\n# Kevalarāma: Court Astronomer\n\nAppointed jyotiṣarāja in 1725, Kevalarāma produced several reconciliatory works:\n\n* Bhāgavatajyotiṣayor bhūgolakhagolavirodhaparihāra: Reconciling siddhāntic spherical astronomy with Bhāgavatapurāṇa's flat-earth cosmology\n* Dṛkpakṣasāriṇī (c. 1732): Versifying Philippe de la Hire's Latin astronomical tables; possibly transcribed European logarithm tables into Nāgarī alphabet\n* Brāhmapakṣanirāsa: Arguing for divinely inspired Sūryasiddhānta's supremacy over human-origin Brāhmapakṣa\n* Pañcāṅgasāriṇī (1735): Tables for calculating pañcāṅgas\n\n# Knowledge of European Astronomy\n\nJayasiṃha knew about heliocentrism, telescope construction, and European tables, but adhered to traditional geocentrism. This was pragmatic: for calculating planetary positions for astrology and calendars, heliocentric models offered no advantages over geocentric ones. The mathematical procedures worked equally well in either framework. Adopting heliocentrism would require abandoning centuries of accumulated Indian work. Jayasiṃha sought improving traditional systems' accuracy by incorporating better observational data and refined parameters rather than wholesale replacement.\n\n# Legacy\n\nJayasiṃha's projects had mixed results. His definitive zīj goal wasn't achieved—the Zīj-i Muhammad Shāhī was used but didn't revolutionize practice. His observatories, while impressive, were built as naked-eye positional astronomy was ending in Europe. The translations made important texts available but didn't immediately transform practice.\n\nNevertheless, his legacy was significant: demonstrating rulers could actively participate in scientific work; creating enduring institutions (observatories, libraries); fostering empiricism and cross-cultural learning; producing inspiring monuments—particularly Jaipur observatory.\n\n# Post-Jayasiṃha Astronomy (1750-1800)\n\n# Śrīnātha Chāgāni (c. 1750)\n\nThe tradition continued after Jayasiṃha's death. Around 1750, Śrīnātha Chāgāni composed Yantraprabhā (Light of Instruments) based on Jayasiṃha's Yantrarājaracanāprakriyā, presumably expanding upon his instrument descriptions.\n\n# Candrāyaṇa Miśra of Mulatāna (1748)\n\nWorking in Mulatāna (Multan), historically connected to Rajasthani networks, Candrāyaṇa Miśra composed in 1748: Sūryasiddhāntasāraṇīpaddhati, Tithikalpavṛkṣa, and Grahaspaṣṭasāraṇī.\n\n# Budhasiṃha Śarman of Mulatāna (1764-1766)\n\nAlso at Mulatāna, Budhasiṃha Śarman completed Grahaṇādarśa (Mirror of Eclipses) in 1764, followed by self-commentary Prabodhinī in 1766. The concentration of mid-18th-century astronomical activity in Mulatāna suggests Jayasiṃha's projects' effects extended beyond Rajasthan proper.\n\n# Nandarāma Miśra of Kāmyakavana\n\nThe most prolific late 18th-century astronomer in Rajasthan and neighboring regions, Nandarāma Miśra produced: Grahaṇapaddhati (1763), Yantrasāra (1771), Laghucintāmaṇi (1777), and Goladarpaṇa (before 1767)—extending Kevalarāma's reconciliation of spherical astronomy with Bhāgavatapurāṇa cosmology.\n\nNandarāma's diverse output demonstrates comprehensive astronomical knowledge was still actively cultivated in late 18th-century Rajasthan. However, his works—mostly practical handbooks and traditional synthesis attempts rather than innovative research—suggest the creative phase was closing.\n\n# Rajasthan's Manuscript Collections\n\nBeyond individual astronomers, Rajasthan's most lasting contribution may be manuscript preservation. The foundation laid by Anūpasiṃha (late 17th century), continued by Jayasiṃha (early 18th century), and expanded by Kota mahārājas (19th century) created India's largest and most important astronomical manuscript repositories.\n\nSeveral factors favored preservation:\n\n* Dry Climate: Unlike humid monsoon regions quickly destroying manuscripts, Rajasthan's desert climate allowed centuries-long survival\n* Political Stability: Despite occasional conflicts, Rajput kingdoms maintained continuity, allowing libraries to grow over generations\n* Royal Patronage: Competitive prestige economy among rulers meant impressive libraries marked cultural sophistication\n* Jaina Community: Substantial Jaina communities maintained libraries (bhaṇḍāras) for religious and secular texts\n\nToday, Rajasthan's libraries—Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur (particularly Rajasthan Oriental Research Institute), and Kota—house India's largest astronomical manuscript collections, including unique copies of works lost elsewhere. Modern scholars working on Indian astronomical history rely heavily on these Rajasthani collections.\n\n# Characteristics of Rajasthani Astronomical Tradition\n\nSeveral distinctive features characterize Rajasthan's astronomical tradition:\n\nRoyal Involvement: More than elsewhere in India, astronomy was intimately connected with royal courts. Rulers were active participants, not merely passive patrons.\n\nSynthesis of Traditions: Rajasthani astronomers were notably eclectic, drawing on Hindu, Islamic, and European sources. Rather than rigidly adhering to one school (pakṣa), they sought best methods from various traditions.\n\nPractical Orientation: While respecting comprehensive theoretical treatises (siddhāntas), Rajasthani astronomers preferred practical works: karaṇas, koṣṭhakas, and instrument texts.\n\nInnovation in Presentation: Cyclic planetary tables and Jayasiṃha's monumental masonry instruments represented genuine innovations in organizing and presenting astronomical knowledge.\n\nContinuity and Longevity: From early 16th century through late 18th century, Rajasthan maintained continuous astronomical activity—nearly 300 years, testifying to deep institutionalization.\n\n# Decline and Transformation: 19th Century and Beyond\n\nBy early 19th century, traditional Sanskrit astronomy in Rajasthan was declining. Contributing factors:\n\nColonial Impact: British rule undermined regional rulers' political and economic power. Rajput mahārājas lost resources and independence supporting scholarly patronage. British educational policies promoted Western science while marginalizing traditional learning.\n\nInstitutional Changes: Traditional guru-śiṣya education couldn't compete with modern schools teaching Western astronomy.\n\nPractical Obsolescence: For navigation, surveying, timekeeping, European methods and instruments were demonstrably superior.\n\nIntellectual Shift: Indian intellectuals increasingly saw traditional astronomy as outdated. By mid-19th century, most educated Indians accepted Western astronomy's scientific superiority.\n\nNevertheless, traditional astronomy didn't disappear entirely. Even today: traditional pañcāṅgas continue being published; muhūrta and jātaka astrology remain popular; some families maintain astronomical learning traditions; institutions like Rajasthan Oriental Research Institute preserve and study manuscripts.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nRajasthan's contribution to Indian astronomy, though concentrated in a relatively brief period (roughly 1550-1800), was substantial and distinctive. The region served as a crucible where Hindu, Islamic, and European astronomical traditions interacted, producing synthetic works drawing on each tradition's strengths. Royal patronage, particularly under Anūpasiṃha and Jayasiṃha, created conditions for astronomical work flourishing on a scale unmatched elsewhere in 18th-century India.\n\nRajasthani astronomers—from Caṇḍīḍāsa in 16th-century Jodhpur through Nandarāma Miśra in the late 18th century—produced commentaries making classical texts accessible, developed innovative computational methods like cyclic tables, built monumental observatories remaining architectural marvels, translated key works from Arabic and Persian into Sanskrit, and attempted ambitious syntheses of different systems.\n\nMost importantly, Rajasthan's rulers and Jaina communities preserved an unparalleled astronomical manuscript collection remaining crucial for understanding Indian astronomical history. Without libraries established in Bikaner, Jaipur, and other Rajasthani cities, much knowledge of medieval and early modern Indian astronomy would be lost.\n\nRajasthan's astronomical tradition represents not merely a regional variant but a distinctive synthesis bridging different cultural traditions, combining theoretical and practical interests, and maintaining high scholarship standards under sustained royal patronage. While traditional astronomy ultimately couldn't compete with European astronomy's scientific revolution, Rajasthani astronomers' achievements remain testament to pre-modern India's sophisticated astronomical knowledge and to the vision of rulers and scholars sustaining this tradition for three centuries.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndicKnowledgeSystems/comments/1q27il2/astronomy_in_rajasthan_a_comprehensive_history_of/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0}}

The life you're supposed to have. The person you're supposed to become. What 2026 could actually look like if you just **believed** hard enough. You felt **alive**. Inspired. Like maybe, just maybe, you weren't **broken** after all. Main character energy was **LOCKED IN**.\n\nBy 3 PM? **Gone** 💔 The clarity **evaporated** like it was never real. You started **doubting everything**. Scrolling for hours. Wondering if you made it all up in your head. Questioning whether you even **deserve** the things you want. The fall off was **devastating** 💀\n\n**You're not losing your mind. This is Mercury square Neptune, and it's playing with ALL of us right now**.​\n\nIf you've felt **off** since New Year's Eve, if your brain feels like **static**, if you're cycling between **hope** and **crushing self-doubt** every few hours, if you wrote down goals on Jan 1st that now feel **impossible**. This is **why**. And bestie, we need to talk about this first week because it's either going to **save your breakthrough year** or **destroy it** before it even starts.\n\nNo cap, I'm mapping out every single **emotional trap** and **cosmic opportunity** so you don't waste the year we've been promised since 2011.\n\n# 📍Where We Are Right Now (Friday, Jan 2)\n\nYou're reading this on **Friday, January 2nd**, which means you're currently **drowning** in the **thick** of the Mercury-Neptune confusion fog. Yesterday (Thursday, Jan 1) was the **peak**, but the effects are still messing with your head through the weekend. It's giving \"gaslight gatekeep girlboss\" but make it planetary.​\n\nIf you made any New Year's resolutions on Jan 1st that now feel unrealistic or overwhelming. That's Neptune **lying** to you. If you had a moment of clarity that dissolved by afternoon. That's Mercury-Neptune **stealing your hope**.\n\n**The good news?** Now that you **KNOW** what's happening, you can **work with it** instead of drowning in it. And the **really** good news? By Wednesday Jan 7th, this fog clears and you get **actual momentum**.​\n\nLet me walk you through exactly what's coming so you're not moving blind. We're not about to let the planets play us like this.\n\n# 🚨 Thursday Jan 1st: Your Brain Was Lying To You\n\n**Mercury square Neptune** peaked on Thursday. Translation? Every thought you had was **distorted**.​\n\nThat text you wanted to send? I hope you **didn't**.  \nThat job you suddenly thought you weren't qualified for? **You are.** (Imposter syndrome was just screaming)  \nThat person you were overthinking? They're **not** thinking about you as deeply as Neptune convinced you they were fr.\n\n**Real talk:** So many of us almost didn't show up on Thursday because Neptune whispered \"**nobody cares what you have to say**\" so loudly we believed it. The intrusive thoughts were intrusive-ing **hard**. But here's the thing: **Neptune has been gaslighting Pisces since 2011**. Thursday was its **last major attempt** to keep us small before it exits on **Jan 26th**.​\n\n**If you made decisions on Jan 1st:** Revisit them on **January 7th** when the fog clears. If they still make sense then, proceed. If not, you just saved yourself from a Neptune-induced **disaster**. We love self-awareness.\n\n# ❌ Things that were risky on Thursday Jan 1:\n\n* Sending **emotional texts/emails** (trauma dumping at 2 AM was **NOT** the move 💀)\n* Making **financial commitments**\n* Having \"where is this going?\" **relationship talks** (the timing? absolutely not)\n* Signing **contracts** without reading the fine print **twice**\n* Trusting your **inner critic** (that was Neptune, not truth bestie)\n\n# ✅ Things that were safe:\n\n* **Journaling** (getting the foggy thoughts OUT where they belong)\n* **Creative writing, music, art** (channeling confusion into beauty, very demure, very mindful)\n* Rewatching your **comfort show** (The Office has never let us down)\n* **Feeling your feelings** without explaining them (revolutionary concept tbh)\n\nMercury also entered Capricorn on Jan 1st, which normally helps us think practically. But squared with Neptune, it was like trying to make solid plans while standing in **quicksand**. The way we were **SET UP**.​\n\n# 🌕 Saturday Jan 3rd: The Full Moon That Finally Sees You\n\n**Full Moon in Cancer at 13 degrees**.​\n\nThis Full Moon is **different**. lowkey it hits different when you know the context. Here's what nobody tells you: it's the **last one we'll ever experience with Neptune in Pisces**. Let that **sink in**. After **15 years** of blurred boundaries, confusing emotions, and feeling like you're too sensitive for this world, this Full Moon is giving us **one final chance** to release what we've been carrying from the Neptune era.​\n\nIt's giving us a **closure arc**.\n\n# 💫 What you'll feel on Saturday Jan 3rd:\n\n* **Vivid dreams** with actual messages (Write them down **immediately** or they'll disappear like Snapchat memories)​\n* Sudden, **gut-wrenching clarity** about a relationship or friendship (The download will be downloading)\n* **Intense need** for alone time but also **desperate craving** for affection (The duality is duality-ing)​\n* Sensitivity turned up to **11** (you might cry at a commercial, and honestly? Let it out)\n* **Nostalgia hitting so hard it physically hurts** (Memories surfacing for a reason, not just to torture us)\n\nThe Moon is conjunct Jupiter retrograde, which means emotions feel **catastrophically bigger** than they are. If something hurts your feelings on Saturday, it will feel like the **end of the world**. Give it **48 hours** before reacting. Monday's perspective will be completely different. Trust the process, my Pisces bestie.​\n\nBut here's the **gift**: this Full Moon **trines the North Node**, which means your intuition is **screaming truth** right now. That gut feeling about your career? **Trust it.** That sense someone isn't being honest? **You're right.** That dream that felt significant? **It is.** Your spidey senses are actually accurate for once.​\n\n# 🕯️ Your Saturday Jan 3rd ritual:\n\n* Light a candle (any color, doesn't matter, we're not gatekeeping)\n* Write down **one thing** you're releasing from the 2011-2026 Neptune in Pisces era (a belief that you're **too much**, a person who **drained you**, a fear that kept you **small**, a habit of **self-abandonment**)\n* **Burn it or rip it up** (satisfying either way ngl)\n* Say out loud: **\"I'm done carrying what was never mine.\"**\n\nThis isn't woo-woo. This is **survival**. Your subconscious **needs** this closure before the next chapter starts. We're doing the emotional labour so 2026 can do its thing.\n\n# ✨ Tuesday Jan 6th: The Day Love Finally Resets\n\n**Venus cazimi (Venus conjunct Sun)** in Capricorn.​\n\nThis happens **once a year**, and it's basically the universe handing you a **cosmic glow-up** in love, money, and self-worth after years of feeling unworthy. The universe understood the assignment.​\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say **Tuesday January 6th is THE day to:**\n\n* **Shoot your shot** with your crush (the stars are literally conspiring for you)\n* Update your **dating profile** (with that pic where you look absolutely stunning)\n* Have a **first date** that might actually go somewhere\n* Apply for the **raise** you've been too scared to ask for\n* **Launch something creative** you've been hiding\n* Buy yourself something that makes you feel **worthy** (treat yourself like you matter, because you do)\n* **Network** or reach out to connections (your LinkedIn is about to pop off)\n\nVenus cazimi means Venus is **reborn** in the Sun's light. Old, painful patterns around love and money get **erased**. If you've been stuck attracting the same emotionally unavailable type or dealing with the same money shame, this is your **cosmic reset button**. We're breaking **generational curses** on a Tuesday.​\n\nFor Pisces specifically, this is happening in your **11th house** (friendships, networks, hopes, dreams). Someone in your circle might become something **more**. Or a friend introduces you to someone who actually **sees you**. Or you realize a friendship has been **low-key romantic** this whole time, and Tuesday Jan 6th is when it **finally clicks**. The slow burn is finally burning.\n\n# 💘 Real scenario that might happen:\n\nYou're at a work thing or social gathering (or even just scrolling online). Someone you've known casually suddenly looks **different** to you. Conversation flows like you've known each other **forever**. There's a **spark** that makes your heart race. You exchange numbers or make plans. By Wednesday Jan 7th (when Venus conjuncts Mars ), that spark **explodes into action**, a date, a confession, a moment you'll **remember**. Rom-com protagonist energy activated.​\n\n# 🔑 Your Tuesday Jan 6th hack:\n\n**Show up.** Literally just **show up**. Say **yes** to the invite even if anxiety is screaming no. **Reply to the DM** you've been overthinking. Wear the outfit that makes you feel **powerful**. Post that thing you've been **too scared** to share. Be **visible** today, even if it terrifies you. Venus cazimi rewards those who step into the **light**. Highkey this is your moment to **shine**.\n\n# 🔥 Wednesday Jan 7th: When Desire Finally Meets Action\n\n**Venus conjunct Mars** in Capricorn.​\n\nIf Tuesday Jan 6th was the spark, Wednesday Jan 7th is the **explosion**. We're not playing anymore!\n\nThis is **rare**. Venus (love, beauty, desire) and Mars (action, drive, passion) meeting in the sign of **commitment** and building something **real**. This isn't a fling that fizzles. This is \"let's actually build something that **lasts**\" energy. It's giving serious relationship vibes.​\n\n# 🌟 What this looks like for you on Wednesday:\n\n* The person you're interested in **finally makes a move** (FINALLY)\n* You finally take action on the dream you've been **too scared** to chase (no more \"someday\")\n* A creative project gains **unstoppable momentum** (the algorithm is gonna eat)\n* You feel **confident and decisive** for the first time in months (hello, where has this version of you been??)\n* Conversations about future plans feel **exciting** instead of terrifying (we love actual growth)\n\n# 💼 Career hack:\n\nIf you've been waiting to pitch an idea, ask for a promotion, or apply for something that feels too ambitious, **do it between Tuesday-Wednesday Jan 6-7**. Venus-Mars cazimi in your networking house means people are actually **paying attention** and taking you **seriously** for once. Your professional era starts **now**!\n\n# 💕 Relationship hack:\n\nThis is \"**define the relationship**\" energy that actually **works** instead of backfiring. If you've been stuck in situationship hell, Tuesday-Wednesday Jan 6-7 is when **clarity finally emerges**. Someone will make their intentions **crystal clear**, or you will. No more **breadcrumbs**, we're demanding the **whole damn loaf**!\n\nBut here's the **brutal truth**: Mars-Venus in Capricorn doesn't tolerate **messy**. It demands **intentional**. So if someone's giving you breadcrumbs or mixed signals, this transit will make their lack of commitment **painfully, undeniably obvious**. And that's actually a **gift**. Because 2026 is our breakthrough year, and we're **not wasting a single day** on people who don't know what they want. We're **too grown for games**.\n\n# 📌 Week 1 Cheat Sheet\n\n✅ **Thursday Jan 1:** Don't make big decisions (Mercury-Neptune fog peak)  \n✅ **Saturday Jan 3:** Release ritual under Cancer Full Moon (let that sh\\*t GO)  \n✅ **Tuesday Jan 6:** Venus cazimi - show up and be seen even if it scares you (main character day)  \n✅ **Wednesday Jan 7:** Take action on what you want (Venus-Mars conjunction, zero hesitation)\n\n# 💡 The Thing Nobody's Talking About\n\nThis first week is **testing whether you're ready** for the breakthrough.\n\nNeptune threw a fog bomb to confuse you (Thursday-Friday Jan 1-2). The Full Moon is making you feel **everything you've been avoiding** (Saturday Jan 3). But then Venus and Mars show up like \"okay, crying session over, time to **build your actual new life**\" (Tuesday-Wednesday Jan 6-7). The emotional whiplash is **brutal but necessary**.​\n\nThis is the **pattern of your entire 2026**: feel it deeply, release it completely, **act on it bravely**.\n\nIf you can navigate Week 1 without self-sabotaging, spiraling into doubt, or convincing yourself you're not ready, you're setting the **foundation for your entire breakthrough year**. The groundwork we lay this week? **Absolutely crucial**.\n\n**The breakthrough starts now. Week 1 is our foundation. Don't waste it.** ✨🌊\n\n***P.S.*** *Screenshot the Week 1 cheat sheet. You'll* ***actually need it***. And if Thursday-Friday Jan 1-2 Mercury-Neptune brain made you doubt yourself, spiral, or almost give up, ***PUSH BACK***. You're ***not alone***. I promise you're ***not alone***. Solidarity over suffering, Pisces bestie. 💙\n\n**Also, check out my previous posts:**\n\n* [The 10-Year Storm is Over: Neptune Leaves Pisces January 26th.

DYOR, NFA.\n\nWhat happened\n- $REBATE reached a new ATH in market cap and saw strong volume today as community activity spiked.\n- This move is organic: fair launch, no team allocation, no VC, no KOL or influencer allocations-100% community ownership.\n- Silent-launch mechanics (launched November 14, 2025 on pump.fun; bonded December 13, 2025) helped build a clean base by minimizing sniper and bot pressure.\n\nWhy this matters\n- Narrative alignment: $REBATE is positioned for the potential tariff rebate narrative tied to Trump’s announced $2,000 tariff rebate conversation for Q2 2026. That narrative is driving interest across meme-coin-savvy investors-similar attention to how the 2021 stimulus checks catalyzed meme rallies.\n- Utility-driven: We aren’t just a tweet or logo. RaidBate (custom raid coordination), Game Bot (CoinFlip and RPS), Buy Bot (tier-based tracking), PILLY (community AI chat), and Bella (conversation summarizer) are live and supporting organic engagement.\n- Tokenomics: Total supply 1,000,000,000; team allocation 0%; VC allocation 0%; community-owned 100%; contract J1pLHsz1uCZQuYX7tbt2Q79VEDJxVhSgwGz2hRmSpump. Fair launch on pump.fun, bonded December 13, 2025.\n\nRecent traction &amp; milestones\n- Bonded December 13, 2025\n- ATH market cap achieved\n- Peak activity metrics recorded today across DEX listings and utility usage\n- Listings: currently live on PumpSwap, DexScreener, DexTools, GeckoTerminal, Birdeye, Photon, GMGN, Capitoday, Lewk, MEXC DEX+; pending listings include Jupiter, CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Raydium\n- Active community growth with 400+ members in chat and 150+ holders (public milestone stats)\n\nWhat Rebaters should know and do\n- Stay engaged: use RaidBate for coordinated raids, try Game Bot games to earn attention and grow engagement, and experiment with PILLY and Bella to streamline community work.\n- Check live markets: contract address J1pLHsz1uCZQuYX7tbt2Q79VEDJxVhSgwGz2hRmSpump and liquidity pool EpQLSwrybgE2SqCxMAsbHcSuNx1GwiShC6wANsRg7Xac.\n- Share responsibly: organic growth is our ethos-help onboard newcomers by explaining the narrative and utilities, and encourage thoughtful discussion rather than spam.\n- Keep screenshots and receipts: celebrate wins, document raids, and highlight meaningful community contributions so the story grows authentically.\n\nQuick explainer for newcomers - the tariff rebate narrative\n- The narrative centers on a proposed $2,000 tariff rebate conversation tied to Trump for Q2 2026. Narrative tokens historically respond to macro stimulus expectations-recall how 2021 stimulus checks were a driver behind big meme rallies.\n- Narrative tokens don’t guarantee outcomes. The token’s potential comes from social momentum, utility, and community coordination around an event that could draw increased retail attention.\n- $REBATE combines that narrative with real community-built tooling (RaidBate, Game Bot, Buy Bot, PILLY, Bella) and fair-launch tokenomics to aim for a clean, community-first movement.\n\nWhere we go from here\n- Roadmap highlights for Q1 2026 include staking, a 47M token airdrop, Earn2Raid rewards, Rebate Swap hybrid platform, and referral system. These utilities and reward mechanisms are designed to keep engagement high and give Rebaters more ways to participate.\n- Listings progress and CEX talks continue; patience and persistence in organic growth are core principles.\n\nFinal notes\n- We celebrate this ATH as a community win. It reflects coordinated activity, utility usage, and organic hype.\n- Stay factual, stay respectful, and keep building. If you’re new, welcome to the Rebaters-read the contract, check liquidity pools, and engage in the community channels. Do your own research and never treat social posts as financial advice.\n\nQuestions?

Primary activity over northern Tehran (Shemiran district), with object tracked south of the city. Secondary ground location near dry lake bed west of Tehran (Karaj region). Coordinates approximately 36.4°N, 51.4°E.\n\n**Brief summary:** In the early hours of September 19, 1976, Iranian civilians reported a bright object over Tehran. The Imperial Iranian Air Force scrambled two F-4 Phantom II interceptors. Both jets experienced sudden loss of instrumentation and communications systems when approaching the object. The second pilot attempted to fire an AIM-9 missile when a smaller object appeared to approach his aircraft, but weapons systems failed at that moment. Systems restored upon withdrawal. The incident was documented in a U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report that called it \"a classic which meets all the criteria necessary for a valid study of the UFO phenomenon.\"\n\n[Map of Iran showing key locations. Tehran \\(national capital\\) is where civilian sightings originated and Mehrabad International Airport is located. Hamadan, approximately 140 miles \\(225 km\\) west-southwest of Tehran, was the location of Shahrokhi Air Force Base, from which both F-4 Phantom interceptors were scrambled. The object was tracked approximately 40 nautical miles north of Tehran, in the Alborz Mountain foothills toward the Caspian Sea.

It was declassified and released via FOIA on August 31, 1977 to civilian UFO researchers (believed to be NICAP or CUFOS). The document carries standard military formatting, classification markings (later downgraded to Unclassified), and a distribution list including the White House, Secretary of State, CIA, NSA, and Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe NSA package was declassified later (1980s-1990s) and includes a cover memo by USAF Captain Henry S. Shields dated October 1978. This document was initially classified \"Confidential\" and released with some redactions.\n\nBoth documents are hosted on official government FOIA reading rooms (NSA) and verified document repositories (The Black Vault, which obtained them directly via FOIA requests).\n\n**Anachronisms or red flags:**\n\nNone identified. The documents use terminology, formatting, and classification procedures consistent with 1976-era military communications. The distribution list references commands and offices that existed at that time. Place names, aircraft designations (F-4 Phantom II), and technical details (AN/APG-73 radar characteristics, AIM-9 Sidewinder) are accurate for the period and location.\n\n**If sources are contested:**\n\nThe documents themselves are not contested as authentic U.S. government records. What remains contested is the *interpretation* of the events they describe—see Part 6.\n\n# PART 3: WITNESS EVALUATION\n\n# Witness Overview\n\n**Number of known witnesses:** Approximately 12+ documented witnesses across multiple locations:\n\n* 4+ civilian callers (anonymous in reports)\n* 1 Iranian Air Force general (Nader Yousefi)\n* 2 F-4 aircrews (4 personnel total): Lt. Yaddi Nazeri + WSO (first jet); Maj. Parviz Jafari + 1st Lt. Jalal Damirian (second jet)\n* Mehrabad Airport tower controllers (including supervisor Hossein Pirouzi)\n* Local residents near ground site (interviewed morning after)\n* Civilian airliner crew (experienced radio failure in same area; did not see object)\n\n**Independence of witnesses:** Witnesses were distributed across multiple locations: northern Tehran (civilians, General Yousefi), airborne (two separate F-4 crews at different times), Mehrabad tower (controllers), and the ground site west of Tehran (villagers interviewed the next morning). The civilian callers reported before any military response. The two F-4 crews flew sequentially, not simultaneously, and would not have been in direct communication about observations until after landing. Tower controllers observed independently and confirmed sightings when directed where to look by aircrew. Villagers near the ground site were interviewed the morning after and had no contact with military witnesses.\n\n**Witness backgrounds:**\n\n* **Gen. Nader Yousefi:** Assistant Deputy Commander of Operations, IIAF. Senior officer with authority to scramble fighters. Trained military aviator.\n* **Maj. Parviz Jafari:** Squadron commander, experienced F-4 pilot. Later retired as a general. Gave testimony at 2007 National Press Club event in Washington, D.C.\n* **1st Lt. Jalal Damirian:** Weapons Systems Officer on second F-4. Responsible for radar operation and weapons targeting.\n* **Lt. Yaddi Nazeri:** Pilot of first F-4.\n* **Hossein Pirouzi:** Mehrabad Airport tower supervisor. Experienced air traffic controller.\n* **Civilian witnesses:** No specific backgrounds recorded; reported independently to authorities.\n\n[Witness sketch by Hossein Pirouzi depicting his first sighting. Pirouzi described an 8-meter cylindrical or rectangular object with elliptical discs of pulsating whitish-blue light at each end \\(\\~2 meters diameter\\), connected by an invisible main body inferred from the arrangement of lights. A hazy yellow-blue arc appeared above the main body, and one round red light circled the object, pausing briefly every quarter-turn. Pirouzi noted the main body \\\\\"itself not visible to the eye, but... was 'obvious' to him from general perspective and arrangement of lights.\\\\\" Source: Bob Pratt interviews \\(fall 1976\\), compiled in Don Berliner, UFO Briefing Document: The Best Available Evidence \\(1995\\).](https://preview.redd.it/q9izo7zj7tag1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b8a166127ba74dbb69a38618ef714012a0c382b)\n\n# Testimony Quality Assessment\n\n**Position to observe:**\n\n*Aircrews:* Both F-4 crews were operating advanced interceptor aircraft with radar systems. The second crew acquired radar lock at 27 nautical miles and tracked the object. Visual observation occurred at various distances; Jafari reported being able to see the object's lights from significant range due to brightness. Weather was clear. Observation duration was approximately 30+ minutes for the second crew.\n\n*Tower controllers:* Located at Mehrabad International Airport with standard tower visibility. Initially could not see object until directed by Jafari to look between specific landmarks; then tracked it visually until it passed behind terrain.\n\n*General Yousefi:* Observed from ground position in northern Tehran. Clear night sky.\n\n*Villagers:* Did not observe the airborne object but reported audible noise and visible light flash at approximately the time the object was reported to descend.\n\n**Timing of testimony:**\n\n* The DIA report was transmitted the same day (September 19, 1976), indicating witness accounts were collected and forwarded within hours of the event.\n* The report contains what appear to be near-verbatim descriptions relayed from Iranian military to U.S. attaché.\n* Major Jafari's account has been consistent across retellings from 1976 through his 2007 National Press Club testimony. He has not substantially changed his description of events.\n* Villagers were interviewed the morning after the incident, within 12 hours.\n\n**Potential for contamination:**\n\n* The two F-4 crews flew sequentially. The first crew (Nazeri) landed before the second crew (Jafari) had their encounter, so some information could have been relayed via radio. However, both experienced similar equipment failures independently.\n* Civilian callers reported before any military activity began.\n* The DIA report was compiled before any media coverage.\n* No evidence of leading questions in the documented accounts; the report reads as factual military debriefing.\n* Major Jafari's later public appearances (1990s-2000s) occurred after the case became well-known in UFO literature, but his core account matches the 1976 documentation.\n\n**Motivation and credibility indicators:**\n\n* **Professional risk:** Iranian military officers had nothing to gain by reporting equipment failures during an intercept mission. Such failures could reflect poorly on their competence or aircraft readiness.\n* **No profit motive:** The witnesses did not seek publicity at the time. The incident was kept relatively quiet by Iranian authorities.\n* **Statements against interest:** Reporting that weapons systems failed when attempting to engage reflects poorly on military readiness; this is not something personnel would fabricate.\n* **Later publicity:** Major Jafari did participate in UFO-related events decades later (2007 Press Club), but his account has remained consistent with the 1976 documentation.\n* **Indifference vs. investment:** Jafari has expressed personal belief that the object was \"not from Earth,\" but his described observations match the contemporaneous report regardless of interpretation.\n\n**Confidence vs. corroboration:**\n\nWitness confidence is high. These are trained military personnel who flew toward the object and experienced equipment failures they attribute to it. Their confidence is supported by:\n\n* Radar tracking (documented in report)\n* Multiple independent observers (ground, air, civilian, military)\n* Equipment anomalies on multiple aircraft\n* DIA analyst assessment calling it a case meeting all valid study criteria\n\n[Iranian F-4 Phantom II over Tehran.

The Milad Tower and snow-capped Alborz Mountains are visible in the background; the object was tracked approximately 40 nautical miles north of Tehran, toward these mountains. Iran received 225 F-4s from the U.S. before the 1979 revolution and remarkably still operates them today. The aircraft were among the most advanced interceptors of the era, equipped with AN\\/APG-120 radar and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles - systems that reportedly failed when approaching the unidentified object.

Radar lock was maintained until the object accelerated away. Tehran Mehrabad tower controllers also detected an object on their scopes when directed where to look. However, no radar scope photographs or data recordings have been publicly released. Iranian military reportedly retained radar tapes, but these were never declassified (and may have been lost after the 1979 revolution).\n\nUnconfirmed: Some researchers (Lee Graham, Ron Regehr) have claimed U.S. DSP (Defense Support Program) early-warning satellites detected an infrared event over Tehran coinciding with the incident. This has not been officially confirmed or released.\n\n**Physical Traces**\n\n* \\[ \\] Ground traces (landing marks, soil changes, burned vegetation)\n* \\[ \\] Material samples (analyzed by whom? Results?)\n* \\[x\\] Effects on electronics or vehicles\n* \\[ \\] Physiological effects on witnesses (documented how?)\n* \\[ \\] Effects on animals\n\n**Details:** The primary physical effect was electromagnetic interference with aircraft systems. Both F-4s experienced:\n\n* Loss of UHF communications\n* Loss of intercom\n* Instrumentation failures\n* Weapons control panel failure (second jet, when attempting to fire)\n\nAll systems restored upon increasing distance from object. A civilian airliner in the same area also experienced radio failure, though the crew did not observe the object.\n\nThe morning-after helicopter search of the suspected ground site found no burn marks, debris, or impact crater. Radiation checks were conducted on the site and the F-4 aircraft; results were never publicly released. A \"beeping transponder\" signal was detected nearby but traced to an unrelated aircraft beacon (from a C-141 transport) that had previously been lost in the area.\n\n**Official Documentation**\n\n* \\[x\\] Government/military acknowledgment of the incident\n* \\[x\\] Formal investigation records\n* \\[ \\] Congressional/parliamentary records\n* \\[x\\] FOIA releases specific to this case\n\n**Details:**\n\n* DIA Intelligence Information Report (1976-09-19)\n* DIA Defense Information Report Evaluation Form\n* NSA declassified documents including Capt.

Astrology Transits for January 1st-15th, 2026", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/elderwitches/comments/1q1g6p8/happy_new_year_astrology_transits_for_january/", "subreddit": "elderwitches", "created_utc": 1767304222.0, "selftext": "Happy New Year everyone!\n\nAs always, keep in mind that this column is mostly focusing on the general astrological weather rather than looking at your specific chart, so the energies will impact each of us a little differently depending on where our personal planets are located.\n\nIn order to get this posted on time, I’m just giving the transits for the month rather than a horoscope or affirmation for each sign.\n\n**Elder Witches Astrology Forecast for January  1st to 15th**\n\n**-- by vrwriter78**\n\n \n\nOverview:\n\nJanuary begins with four planets in Capricorn: Mercury which enters Capricorn that afternoon, the sun, Venus, and Mars. Capricorn season is a chance for us to slow down, to take stock of where we’ve been, to decide where we want to go, and to make a plan for getting there. This isn’t about pie-in-the-sky daydreaming of a perfect body or buying a villa in France. Capricorn is concerned with what is practical, viable, and useful. It has plans, and back up plans.\n\nOn the 1^(st), Mercury (the planet of communication and mental clarity) is square Neptune (the planet of dreams, illusions, and medicines, in the sign of soulfulness, idealism, and sensitivity). This could play out in a couple of ways. Some of us will just want to laze at home, maybe watching a good movie or listening to some music and just take it easy because we may not have the will to go out and DO much this holiday. Neptune in Pisces tends to favor rest and creative or nostalgic endeavors, and Capricorn likes the comfort of the familiar.\n\nFor others, this New Year’s holiday could have us not as clear on our goals and resolutions as we’d like to be (or at worst case, lead us down the wrong track toward unrealistic resolutions). Our minds just aren’t in the best place for planning and getting things done now and we could delude ourselves about what it actually takes to achieve certain goals. So don’t worry if you haven’t made a list of goals for 2026, that will come. This time is about resting and recuperating from 2025 before we jump into the future.\n\nMy advice is to take it easy and that extends through the weekend as well because the late Gemini moon to early Cancer moon could have us feeling out of sorts as it squares and opposes planets in Pisces, then Capricorn. It is a full moon, too, in Cancer, so it’s a good time to kind of go with the flow or lay low vs. making a lot of plans for the weekend. The moon conjunct Jupiter also magnifies our emotions and if there’s any trouble at home, it may be weighing on your mind. This will mellow out when the moon moves over to Leo on the 4^(th). **Use the Cancer new moon for rituals to heal emotional wounds, to bind or to banish, or to clean up around the home.** You can also check your birth chart to see where Cancer and Capricorn are in your chart to see where tensions may need to be eased.\n\nTuesday, January 6^(th), is a good day to spend with your significant other or to have practical discussions at work as Venus will be conjunct the sun and Mars, bringing optimism and joy to interactions. If you need to iron out nitty-gritty details of a project, that is possible now if everyone is willing to compromise. Just be mindful that the moon will square Uranus, so avoid those who tend to be erratic or emotionally unstable as this square could be triggering for them. Late Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius may feel this moon-Uranus energy more intensely than others. But Capricorn, Virgo, and Pisces are likely to have a smooth day.\n\nPassion ignites on January 7^(th) as Venus and Mars conjoin in Capricorn. While this won’t be the fiery hot flames of Aries or Leo, it’s still a good time for working on creative projects or going on a romantic date. There’s lots of potential for connection and intimacy, BUT be very wary of critical remarks or taking a my-way-or-the-highway type of attitude. The Virgo moon’s opposition to Saturn could cause friction or hurt feelings. Also watch out for power plays at work because the sun opposes Jupiter at the same time. Someone may try to flex their authority. Expect some sparks to fly on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nOn January 9^(th), the sun, Mars, and Venus make a conjunction, so all three are operating as one unit. Earth signs, this could be your time to sign if you need to make a presentation or need to assert yourself in meetings. This is going to favor you, but the Libra moon could be a little grating for early Capricorn, Cancer, and Aries folks.\n\nOn the 10^(th), there is friction in the air as several planets in Capricorn, Libra, and Cancer form a T-Square. Libra’s usual diplomatic nature is not easily able to resolve this deadlock, so someone could walk away hurt or angry. The key to resolution is to take an Aries-like approach. Take some time alone, work on your own projects, take a walk, or go get some exercise. If you find yourself caught in a situation, take a break and cool down for a few hours before attempting to talk through it.\n\nFor some of us, T-Squares can manifest as feeling pressure on all sides and exhaustion. If that is the case, realize that doing the same thing over and over is not getting the results you need. Either you need to clear your head and reduce stress by getting some alone time, doing some exercise/stretching), or you may need to take a new approach to the situation.\n\nThe square between Mars and Chiron on the 13^(th) could have some of us feeling grouchy or more sensitive than usual. Chiron (the planet of core wounds and deep healing). Chiron is taking direction from Mars, because it’s currently in Aries, but it’s chafing under the rules and restrictions that Mars in Capricorn is demanding. So if you have planets in Cardinal signs (Aries, Libra, Capricorn, or Cancer) you could be feeling aggravated or weakened under this transit. It will pass, but you may need to release some physical tension or process unresolved anger to get through it.\n\nOn January 14^(th), Mercury exactly opposes Jupiter in Cancer. Those in Cardinal signs are likely to feel moody still, so cut them some slack. The planets in Capricorn want to secure and finalize plans and get work done, but Jupiter in Cancer says no. If it doesn’t feel right, then Jupiter cannot be bothered. Virgo, Pisces, Taurus, and Scorpio suns/moons will be in a better position to navigate this as these planets will be harmonious with you. You might see the solutions where others are too spacey, moody, stubborn, or distracted to really see what’s going on. Use that to your advantage. Early Virgos should keep in mind that the moon is making a square to you on this day, so you may feel more tired or under pressure, but this energy is temporary and will likely fade in a day or so.\n\nA little spontaneity could be good on the 15^(th) as Venus (the planet of love, friendship, and music) will trine Uranus (surprises) and sextile Saturn and Neptune. This could be a day to work on a creative project, to go out on a date, or to beautify your surroundings. Our minds may be distracted from work and longing for the pleasures of the weekend. **This would be a good day for a love spell or spells for your creative pursuits.**\n\n  \nI'm wishing you all a blessed and happy new year!

They had a clear modulation at a frequency of 1.42 GHz (the hydrogen line), which scientists call the \"universal language of communication.\"\nStructure: Mathematical analysis revealed repeating patterns resembling data encoding.

Sharp Non-Gravitational Acceleration (Maneuver)\n\nAfter passing perihelion (its closest point to the Sun), 3I/Atlas did not behave like a comet.\nLack of outgassing: Comets usually accelerate due to the expulsion of gases, but during the 3I/Atlas maneuver, telescopes recorded no associated ejections of dust or vapor.\nVector of movement: The object performed a course correction that allowed it to follow a more favorable trajectory for a gravity assist maneuver at Jupiter. The probability of such an acceleration happening randomly and in exactly the right direction is mathematically negligible.\nImpulse force: The acceleration was brief and intense, which is not characteristic of gradual solar pressure.\n\nWhat is your take on the lack of outgassing during the acceleration?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Bitter_Exchange7214/comments/1q135m5/3iatlas_why_the_142_ghz_signal_and_the_jupiter/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 0}}

This is a community-driven upgrade built with the project’s core values in mind: fair launch, full community ownership, and utility-first development.\n\nQuick recap for newcomers\n- Token: REBATE (Solana SPL)\n- Contract: J1pLHsz1uCZQuYX7tbt2Q79VEDJxVhSgwGz2hRmSpump\n- Launch: Silent launch on pump.fun November 14, 2025\n- Bond date: December 13, 2025\n- Supply: 1,000,000,000 total\n- Team/VC/KOL allocation: 0% each\n- Narrative: Positioned for the narrative around Trump’s proposed $2,000 tariff rebate expected Q2 2026\n- Live utilities: RaidBate, Game Bot (CoinFlip and RPS), Buy Bot, PILLY, Bella\n- Current listings: PumpSwap, DexScreener, DexTools, GeckoTerminal and others; pending listings include Jupiter, CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko\n- Milestones: Bonded, ATH market cap $146K, 400+ Telegram members, 150+ holders\n\nWhat the new website brings\n- Cleaner, faster UX for newcomers and holders\n- Dedicated pages for our live utilities: RaidBate coordination, Game Bot, Buy Bot tiers, PILLY AI chat, and Bella summarizer\n- Easy access to the contract address and pool information so you can verify before interacting\n- Roadmap section that clearly lists Q1 2026 deliverables: staking, 47M airdrop, Earn2Raid rewards, Rebate Swap hybrid platform, referral system\n- Resource hub with guides on bonding mechanics and how our silent launch worked to protect early community equity\n\nWhy this matters\n- REBATE is a narrative token built around a real macro event: Trump’s $2,000 tariff rebate story for Q2 2026. Narrative-driven rallies have historical context. For example, the 2021 stimulus checks played a big part in driving attention to meme tokens like DOGE in that cycle\n- We are 100% community-owned. No team allocation. No VC. No presale. That matters to people who want a fair shot and want to build together\n- The new site is designed to lower friction so more Rebaters can join raids, play with our bots, stake when staking goes live, and participate in the ecosystem\n\nCallouts for holders and Rebaters\n- Double-check the contract before interacting: J1pLHsz1uCZQuYX7tbt2Q79VEDJxVhSgwGz2hRmSpump\n- Expect the site to include plain instructions on how RaidBate works and how to opt into Earn2Raid and staking when those features launch\n- We will keep listing updates and exchange talks public and factual as they develop\n- No paid promos or KOL deals are part of our strategy. Growth is organic and community-led\n\nFAQ highlights\nQ. Is this an official launch or a marketing push?\nA. The website Launch is a product and communications upgrade. It centralizes information about REBATE, our utilities, and next roadmap items. It is not a paid advertisement campaign.\n\nQ. How does the narrative tie into tokenomics?\nA. REBATE is positioned to capture community attention around the tariff rebate narrative ahead of Q2 2026 while maintaining fair-launch tokenomics and bonding curve mechanics introduced at launch and bond date\n\nQ. Where can I verify token and pool?\nA. Use the contract: J1pLHsz1uCZQuYX7tbt2Q79VEDJxVhSgwGz2hRmSpump and the pool: EpQLSwrybgE2SqCxMAsbHcSuNx1GwiShC6wANsRg7Xac on Solana explorers and DEX listings\n\nNext steps and how you can help\n- Visit the site next week and poke around. Give feedback in Telegram discussions with the Rebaters\n- Join RaidBate when you can. Organized, respectful raids and organic engagement are how we grow without paid promos\n- Share guides and verification posts so newcomers can trust the project and confirm details themselves\n\nTransparency and community-first promise\nWe remain faithful to the silent launch strategy that protected early buyers and to the zero-team-token principle. All decisions are announced openly to Rebaters and publicly tracked. Lead developer contact in public channels is icezman1 on Telegram for technical questions.\n\nClosing\nThis is a community win. The redesigned site makes our utilities and roadmap easier to find and helps new Rebaters onboard safely. Expect the site to go live next week and a follow-up post with screenshots and a guided walkthrough.\n\nDYOR. NFA.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/vxdh8gus9mag1.png", "score": 8, "num_comments": 9}}

This is a community-first refresh that highlights our utilities, roadmap, and fair-launch story.\n\nWhat’s changing\n- New site UI focused on clarity and conversions. Cleaner token stats, utilities, and how to join.\n- Dedicated pages for live utilities: RaidBate (custom raid bot), Game Bot (CoinFlip and RPS), Buy Bot (tier-based tracking), PILLY (AI chat), and Bella (conversation summarizer).\n- Onboarding guide for new Rebaters explaining how to buy on Solana and how bonding works.\n- Clear tokenomics and provenance details emphasizing fair launch: zero team allocation, zero VC allocation, zero KOL allocation. Full community ownership.\n- Links to live listings and trackers so you can verify market data on-chain.\n\nKey facts to remember\n- Contract address J1pLHsz1uCZQuYX7tbt2Q79VEDJxVhSgwGz2hRmSpump\n- Network Solana (SPL token)\n- Launch date November 14, 2025; bonded December 13, 2025\n- Total supply 1,000,000,000; community-owned, no presale\n- Live utilities are already active. Q1 2026 roadmap includes staking, a 47M token airdrop, Earn2Raid rewards, Rebate Swap hybrid platform, and referral system.\n\nWhy this matters\n- The redesign is about trust and transparency. Rebaters built this project without team allocation, VC money, or paid KOLs. The site makes that provenance easy to verify.\n- Our narrative ties to the upcoming tariff rebate conversation for Q2 2026. The 2021 stimulus check era showed how macro stimulus events can drive meme rallies. $REBATE is positioned as a narrative token for the potential $2,000 tariff rebate announcement in 2026 while remaining transparent that no outcome is guaranteed.\n- RaidBate gives Rebaters a growing toolkit for organic coordination. That’s grassroots growth, not paid amplification.\n\nHow you can help\n- Visit the new site when it launches next week and explore the utility pages.\n- If you’re new, read the onboarding guide and verify the contract address before interacting: J1pLHsz1uCZQuYX7tbt2Q79VEDJxVhSgwGz2hRmSpump\n- Join the Telegram community to meet other Rebaters and get real-time updates.\n- Try the Game Bot and RaidBate features and share feedback. We build in public and iterate quickly.\n\nCurrent pulse (live market snapshot as of posting)\n- Price: $9.4300e-5\n- 24h Change: +29.02%\n- Market Cap: $94.30K\n- 24h Volume: $3.09K\n- Listings: PumpSwap, DexScreener, DexTools, GeckoTerminal and others; pending: Jupiter, CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Raydium\n\nMilestones so far\n- Silent fair launch on pump.fun November 14, 2025\n- Bonded December 13, 2025\n- ATH market cap $146K, 40K+ peak volume\n- 400+ Telegram members and 150+ holders\n- 100% community ownership from day one\n\nA quick primer for newcomers\n- Narrative: $REBATE is positioned around the possible Trump $2,000 tariff rebate conversation in Q2 2026. This is a narrative token-similar in how the 2021 stimulus checks created momentum for meme coins back then. We always state that the rebate is not guaranteed and this is not financial advice.\n- Fair launch and bonding: The token launched silently with a bonding curve to prevent sniper bot dominance. That means early distribution was community-driven and verifiable on-chain.\n- Utilities: RaidBate coordinates organic raids and engagement. Game Bot and PILLY keep the community fun and active. Bella helps summarize chats and decisions so Rebaters stay aligned.\n\nClosing\nWe’re excited to share the new site with the community next week. This is another step toward scaling tools, transparency, and organic reach. If you have suggestions or spot anything that needs tweaking on launch, post here or ask in Telegram.

{"keyword": "Project Jupiter", "item": {"title": "The Swarm volume 4. Chapter 13: Rapid Reaction Forces", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1q0owk3/the_swarm_volume_4_chapter_13_rapid_reaction/", "subreddit": "HFY", "created_utc": 1767219459.0, "selftext": "​Chapter 13: Rapid Reaction Forces\n\n\n​The blood toll paid on the fields of L’thaarr was too high for any command staff to simply overlook. In accordance with new directives from the combined command, interspecies research and development teams were established. There was only one priority: to develop technology capable of challenging the unnatural, aggressive biology of the invaders.\n\n​For strategists and engineers, the greatest nightmare proved to be the regenerative abilities of the \"crustaceans.\" This gruesome mechanism meant that battlefields strewn with corpses would return to being active death zones in just a dozen or so minutes. Fallen monsters simply rose from the dead, treating the nearest soldier as their first post-resurrection meal.\n\n​The Ullaans, true to their nature, attempted to approach the problem with the grace of a murderous ballet. They proposed weapons as fine as a surgical scalpel—so elegant that the enemy would die in awe of the projectile’s design lines. Meanwhile, the engineers of the Compact insisted on the miniaturization of X-ray cannons, a task as daunting as convincing a lizard to go vegan.\n\n​That’s when the humans and the Taharagch stepped in with an idea so primitive it bordered on genius. If the invaders' chitinous armor mocked lasers and their tissues patched themselves on the fly, it was time to stop playing nice.\n\n​A veteran human engineer stepped into the center of the conference room. This man still remembered the carnage at Beijing, where he had personally traded \"pleasantries\" with the Empire's landing forces; now, he had to design tools of destruction with those same reptiles. He glanced at the holographic, \"intelligent\" Ullaan designs, spat wetly onto the gleaming floor, and rasped:\n\n​\"Dammit, gentlemen. Stop sculpting in shit. We’re just going to modify the rounds for the Imperial railguns. It’s the simplest and fastest solution in this whole crazy galaxy.\"\n\n​The gathered officers froze, but the veteran was just getting started:\n\n​Fire Mode: We’re changing it to a rigid, three-round burst.\n​Stopping Power: We’re expanding the magazine to 60 rounds of 14mm caliber. You’re powerful brutes, Taharagch, so the extra weight won't hurt you. At least you'll stop complaining that sitting in HQ makes your muscles soft.\n​Death Sequence: In every magazine, the rounds will be arranged in a murderous triad:\n​First: A reinforced armor-piercing core. Its job is to shatter that damned chitin and open Pandora's box.\n​Second: A dum-dum round with a notched jacket. It enters the breach and tears apart the remains of the armor and everything underneath, turning the crab’s innards into bloody confetti.\n​Third: A white phosphorus round. In 14mm caliber, there’s enough room to turn the invader into a small, private bonfire.\n​\"With sixty rounds, we have twenty such bursts,\" the veteran summarized. \"That’s enough to permanently put any son of a bitch in the ground, regardless of whether he feels like regenerating or not.\"\n\n​The Ullaans stared at their chronometers with the kind of disbelief they usually reserved for temporal anomalies. The joint team session had lasted only forty-five minutes. To a race that viewed war as a surgical operation, the human method of \"three-layer murdering\" sounded like pure barbarism.\n\n​However, the logic of the Beijing veterans was relentless: if the enemy refuses to rot without an explicit order, the only solution is to deliver that order with enough phosphorus and lead to ensure they cease being an organism and become nothing more than a hot smear on the tactical map.\n\n​The next session belonged to the Ullaans, which for the rest of the army meant one thing: the coffee in their mugs would go cold, and the concept of reality would be subjected to harsh scientific criticism. The team was to handle the detection of the invaders' biological ships—the same ones that appeared in space with the same audacity a tax auditor shows when raiding an illegal casino.\n\n​The Ullaans, whose stealth technology was so advanced that air traffic control couldn't find them in their own parking lot, proposed a sensor system so complex it became incomprehensible by the third slide of the presentation. Nevertheless, they gave their word that no one would \"jump out of the void\" uninvited again.\n\n​When the issue of planetary defense arose, the engineers of the K’borrh race took the floor. Their approach was as predatory as their fleet. To them, the invader wasn't an \"existential threat,\" but simply an ill-prepared meal.\n\n​Operational Principle: Masers. Since the enemy is bio-technological, there must be water in their tissues. And water can be forced to boil.\n​Effect: Frying the invaders from the inside before their pods even touch the ground. The K’borrh project turned the enemy landing into a steaming stew encased in a chitinous can.\n​Mobility: According to the K’borrh, the cannon was \"mobile.\" In practice, this meant a colossus requiring a gargantuan tractor and operators who weren't afraid of their own eyeballs steaming from back-scattered radiation.\n​The Beijing veterans nodded in appreciation.\n\n\"This is a war, not a culinary workshop,\" one technician muttered, \"but if it works, we’ll take those masers. At least the firing positions will be warm.\"\n\n​Finally, there was the matter of open-space combat. Here, the Compact took the lead. Their battle stations—massive fortresses bristling with X-ray cannons—had been burning through Imperial ship hulls back when the races of this layer were still playing at tribal wars. The organic tissue of the \"crustaceans,\" regardless of its unnatural origin, had the durability of wet paper when faced with such energy.\n\n​The marathons of meetings and torture sessions by holographic presentation lasted for weeks. If diplomat frustration could power reactors, the fleet wouldn't have needed fuel for a decade. Ultimately, however, success was achieved: the Rapid Reaction Forces were born.\n\n​The main burden of the fighting—meaning being torn to pieces on the front line—fell onto the shoulders of the Taharagch. The Empire was chosen not just because they were large and angry. The key was their consciousness-copying technology and the most powerful \"Printing\" infrastructure in the galaxy. Speed of deployment was everything, and the Empire had no equal: they set up field printers and immediately embodied thousands of warriors.\n\n​The Taharagch were the perfect soldiers: they had access to veterans who could die ten times a week and, after a quick restart in a new body, return to the front with the same bloodlust and only a slight headache. As the human technicians put it: \"The Taharagch are the only guys who can get a posthumous promotion and pick it up in person a few hours later.\"\n\n​The Human Guard was given the role of support, which in soldier slang meant \"the job so dirty even the lizards didn't want it.\" Thanks to the Swarm's nanites, human organisms were immune to the crustaceans' flagship export: the mutagenic catalyst.\n\n​While other races turned into a formless mass of tentacles and blades upon contact with that sludge, humans simply wiped their wounds and kept going. The Guard was to move in during the second phase as a cosmic pest control crew. Their task was \"cleaning up the remains.\" Once the main invader forces were ground down by the Taharagch, the humans entered the sewers, caves, and all those dark holes where the crustacean remnants tried to pretend they weren't home. In short: if something survived the slaughter on the surface and hid in a cesspool, the Guard was there to make them realize that was a fatal mistake.\n\n​Neo-Geneva, 2590\n​Vice Admiral Lena Kowalska—the one who, in the current flow of time, was merely a ghost from a non-existent line—stretched lazily on the bed. Her muscles, still saturated with the Swarm nanites that had made her nearly immortal in that lost life, responded with rare lightness.\n\n​\"Jesus, I haven't slept this well in ages,\" she muttered.\n\n​Monika, smiling, stroked her hair.\n\n\"I cured you with orgasms,\" she laughed, and Lena responded in kind, feeling a momentary escape from the weight of her duties.\n\n​However, the reality of 2590 would not be ignored. Lena stood up and walked to the window, looking out over the panorama of New Geneva. The city glowed with billions of lights, and giant megatowers—each housing fifty thousand residential quarters—resembled gleaming stalactites piercing the eternally cloudy sky. Though humanity now numbered forty-six billion souls, only a few, like her, had the right to full technological immortality. For Lena, even when the Swarm nanites in her body stop working after a thousand years (per the agreement) and death awaits, her consciousness copy will be printed in a new shell. She touched the back of her head, feeling the terrestrial equivalent of the implant. For the rest, thanks to medical advances, the average lifespan was 156 years—a respectable age, yet still only a blink compared to the thousand-year eternity granted by the Swarm nanites.\n\n​She went outside, heading toward the command quarters. Rain drummed against her jacket, and LED advertisements reflected in the puddles, creating a mosaic of colors reminiscent of tales of old Los Angeles. Above her head, amidst the clouds, giant holographic fish and predatory advertising slogans from Imperial corporations darted by, fighting for the market and customers as fiercely as in the days of the conquest.\n\n​\"Live on Mars! The Sky Dome awaits!\" one sign proclaimed, a reminder of the six billion people living under the \"Sky\"—a giant canopy rising 500 meters above the planet's rusty surface.\n\n​\"A New Start in the Empire! Become a farmer, find peace!\" another ad tempted with a safe life under Taharagch patronage, where citizenship, an implant, and a consciousness copy were guaranteed by Imperial decree.\n\n​\"Europa: a view of Jupiter you never dreamed of!\"—this invitation to the colony on the icy moon shone the brightest. That colony was for the elite.\n\n​Lena raised her head. Above the neon glow sat the Moon—its surface, scarred by centuries of ruthless resource extraction by Ullaan micromachines, looked different now. Residential domes had risen in giant craters, housing a total of seven hundred and thirty million people.\n\n​Passing through various sectors, Lena felt the vibrations of Imperial transport ships, whose 300,000-ton hulls cut through the space above the city, preparing for jumps through the \"Needles\"—the gates that made the galaxy smaller, but also more dangerous.\n\n​She reached the armored doors of the command quarters. She opened them and stepped inside.\n\n​Springfield, Mars\n​The evening in Springfield had a specific, neon hue. The apartment was high up, in the heart of one of the millions of colossal pillars supporting the \"Artificial Sky.\" Through the panoramic window, rows of city lights and the blue glow of lakes—which had begun to fill Martian basins thanks to ongoing terraforming—were visible.\n\n​Kael lay on the wide bed, watching the woman standing with her back to him. Her black hair cascaded down to her waist, contrasting with her fair, warm skin. As she turned slowly, removing the last scrap of black lingerie, her shapely breasts quivered in Mars' light gravity. A goddess, Kael thought, unable to tear his eyes away from her perfect lines.\n\n​She approached him with a grace most colony residents lacked. When she touched his chest with her hand, he felt a shiver. He had almost forgotten what it was like to be touched by soft, warm-blooded flesh, rather than the hard, cold scales he had grown accustomed to during sex with Ta’hirim.\n\n​She mounted him confidently, her hips moving to the rhythm dictated by desire. Kael felt a sudden surge of strength. In this relationship, for the first time in centuries, he could allow himself to dominate. He wouldn't have stood a chance against the powerful, heavy body of a Taharagch female—their bones were denser, their muscles built for high-G combat. Here, however, he dictated the terms. He flipped her over abruptly, gripping her long hair, and entered her from behind. Her cry, high-pitched and purely human, echoed off the walls of the luxury apartment.\n\n​As she collapsed onto the sheets, her body still wracked with tremors.\n\n\"Kael... your females... these bodies feel orgasms in such a strange, intense way,\" she whispered, trying to catch her breath.\n\n​\"Just wait, my love,\" Kael murmured, sliding his hand over her smooth back. \"I’ll show you something else in a moment. You’ll like it, I promise.\"\n\n\"I don't have the strength anymore...\" she sighed, but fascination lanced through her voice.\n\n​\"You wanted to see what it was like to make love to me in a human, female body yourself,\" he reminded her with a smile. \"Get used to it. This is the 'Ferrari' of shells that Imperial credits can buy.\"\n\n\"Ferrari, Kael?\" she repeated the new word tentatively.\n\n\"It’s the name of a legendary, exclusive vehicle from ancient Earth. A symbol of luxury and speed,\" he explained, moving lower.\n\n​He spread her legs with a decisive motion and began kissing her thighs, moving toward the center of her womanhood. He felt a hot, pulsing heat there, so different from the cool cloaca hidden beneath scales that he had known before. He laughed softly, tasting her.\n\n\"You’ll have to get used to the fact that in this version, you’re weaker, physically dependent on my movements.\"\n\nHe didn't stop, and she arched her back, digging her fingers into the mattress. For her, this new, delicate body had become a playground she hadn't dared dream of in the Imperial offices. Ta’hirim, a greedy Imperial official once sentenced to death but saved by the successful smuggling of Wolkow, was now discovering the world anew in her human skin.\n\n​That same evening, deep in a bar in Springfield, where synthetic cigar smoke mingled with the smell of cheap alcohol, one of the patrons slammed his fist on the counter, his eyes glued to the news screen.\n\n​\"For fuck's sake!\" he roared, loud enough to make several people turn. \"This pathetic pre-election government won't even get diarrhea without checking the polls! They won't pass anything new because they're afraid their numbers will drop half a percent. Marcus Thorne? A son of a bitch, I won't deny it, but at least he didn't fuck around when new colonization projects needed approval. Wolkow, grow a pair of balls, man!\"\n\n​The bartender, wiping a glass with a dirty rag, glared at him and set the vessel down with a thud.\n\n\"Shut your mouth and don't provoke people, 'cause you don't know shit,\" he cut in icily. \"Marcus was a sociopath who sent two hundred million people to the grave during the Spark Uprising pacification just to keep his order. All those 'great' military projects of his were built on corpses and slave labor. My father told me how my grandfather worked his fingers to the bone for that bastard, 16 hours a day until he dropped dead from exhaustion.\"\n\n​The bartender leaned against the bar, his gaze hardening.\n\n\"I listened to those stories as a kid, and now, as I stand here, I’m ninety-eight years old. And every day I thank Wolkow for toppling that prick. Hell, both pricks, counting the one that crawled out of that time anomaly thinking he’d grab us by the throat again. So drink your beer and be glad you even have the right to sit here and complain instead of rotting in some ditch for the 'sake of stability.'\"\n\n​The patron pushed his half-empty mug away, his face contorted in a grimace of rage.\n\n\"What the hell are you babbling about?

In accordance with new directives from the combined command, interspecies research and development teams were established. There was only one priority: to develop technology capable of challenging the unnatural, aggressive biology of the invaders.\n\n​For strategists and engineers, the greatest nightmare proved to be the regenerative abilities of the \"crustaceans.\" This gruesome mechanism meant that battlefields strewn with corpses would return to being active death zones in just a dozen or so minutes. Fallen monsters simply rose from the dead, treating the nearest soldier as their first post-resurrection meal.\n\n​The Ullaans, true to their nature, attempted to approach the problem with the grace of a murderous ballet. They proposed weapons as fine as a surgical scalpel—so elegant that the enemy would die in awe of the projectile’s design lines. Meanwhile, the engineers of the Compact insisted on the miniaturization of X-ray cannons, a task as daunting as convincing a lizard to go vegan.\n\n​That’s when the humans and the Taharagch stepped in with an idea so primitive it bordered on genius. If the invaders' chitinous armor mocked lasers and their tissues patched themselves on the fly, it was time to stop playing nice.\n\n​A veteran human engineer stepped into the center of the conference room. This man still remembered the carnage at Beijing, where he had personally traded \"pleasantries\" with the Empire's landing forces; now, he had to design tools of destruction with those same reptiles. He glanced at the holographic, \"intelligent\" Ullaan designs, spat wetly onto the gleaming floor, and rasped:\n\n​\"Dammit, gentlemen. Stop sculpting in shit. We’re just going to modify the rounds for the Imperial railguns. It’s the simplest and fastest solution in this whole crazy galaxy.\"\n\n​The gathered officers froze, but the veteran was just getting started:\n\n​Fire Mode: We’re changing it to a rigid, three-round burst.\n​Stopping Power: We’re expanding the magazine to 60 rounds of 14mm caliber. You’re powerful brutes, Taharagch, so the extra weight won't hurt you. At least you'll stop complaining that sitting in HQ makes your muscles soft.\n​Death Sequence: In every magazine, the rounds will be arranged in a murderous triad:\n​First: A reinforced armor-piercing core. Its job is to shatter that damned chitin and open Pandora's box.\n​Second: A dum-dum round with a notched jacket. It enters the breach and tears apart the remains of the armor and everything underneath, turning the crab’s innards into bloody confetti.\n​Third: A white phosphorus round. In 14mm caliber, there’s enough room to turn the invader into a small, private bonfire.\n​\"With sixty rounds, we have twenty such bursts,\" the veteran summarized. \"That’s enough to permanently put any son of a bitch in the ground, regardless of whether he feels like regenerating or not.\"\n\n​The Ullaans stared at their chronometers with the kind of disbelief they usually reserved for temporal anomalies. The joint team session had lasted only forty-five minutes. To a race that viewed war as a surgical operation, the human method of \"three-layer murdering\" sounded like pure barbarism.\n\n​However, the logic of the Beijing veterans was relentless: if the enemy refuses to rot without an explicit order, the only solution is to deliver that order with enough phosphorus and lead to ensure they cease being an organism and become nothing more than a hot smear on the tactical map.\n\n​The next session belonged to the Ullaans, which for the rest of the army meant one thing: the coffee in their mugs would go cold, and the concept of reality would be subjected to harsh scientific criticism. The team was to handle the detection of the invaders' biological ships—the same ones that appeared in space with the same audacity a tax auditor shows when raiding an illegal casino.\n\n​The Ullaans, whose stealth technology was so advanced that air traffic control couldn't find them in their own parking lot, proposed a sensor system so complex it became incomprehensible by the third slide of the presentation. Nevertheless, they gave their word that no one would \"jump out of the void\" uninvited again.\n\n​When the issue of planetary defense arose, the engineers of the K’borrh race took the floor. Their approach was as predatory as their fleet. To them, the invader wasn't an \"existential threat,\" but simply an ill-prepared meal.\n\n​Operational Principle: Masers. Since the enemy is bio-technological, there must be water in their tissues. And water can be forced to boil.\n​Effect: Frying the invaders from the inside before their pods even touch the ground. The K’borrh project turned the enemy landing into a steaming stew encased in a chitinous can.\n​Mobility: According to the K’borrh, the cannon was \"mobile.\" In practice, this meant a colossus requiring a gargantuan tractor and operators who weren't afraid of their own eyeballs steaming from back-scattered radiation.\n​The Beijing veterans nodded in appreciation.\n\n\"This is a war, not a culinary workshop,\" one technician muttered, \"but if it works, we’ll take those masers. At least the firing positions will be warm.\"\n\n​Finally, there was the matter of open-space combat. Here, the Compact took the lead. Their battle stations—massive fortresses bristling with X-ray cannons—had been burning through Imperial ship hulls back when the races of this layer were still playing at tribal wars. The organic tissue of the \"crustaceans,\" regardless of its unnatural origin, had the durability of wet paper when faced with such energy.\n\n​The marathons of meetings and torture sessions by holographic presentation lasted for weeks. If diplomat frustration could power reactors, the fleet wouldn't have needed fuel for a decade. Ultimately, however, success was achieved: the Rapid Reaction Forces were born.\n\n​The main burden of the fighting—meaning being torn to pieces on the front line—fell onto the shoulders of the Taharagch. The Empire was chosen not just because they were large and angry. The key was their consciousness-copying technology and the most powerful \"Printing\" infrastructure in the galaxy. Speed of deployment was everything, and the Empire had no equal: they set up field printers and immediately embodied thousands of warriors.\n\n​The Taharagch were the perfect soldiers: they had access to veterans who could die ten times a week and, after a quick restart in a new body, return to the front with the same bloodlust and only a slight headache. As the human technicians put it: \"The Taharagch are the only guys who can get a posthumous promotion and pick it up in person a few hours later.\"\n\n​The Human Guard was given the role of support, which in soldier slang meant \"the job so dirty even the lizards didn't want it.\" Thanks to the Swarm's nanites, human organisms were immune to the crustaceans' flagship export: the mutagenic catalyst.\n\n​While other races turned into a formless mass of tentacles and blades upon contact with that sludge, humans simply wiped their wounds and kept going. The Guard was to move in during the second phase as a cosmic pest control crew. Their task was \"cleaning up the remains.\" Once the main invader forces were ground down by the Taharagch, the humans entered the sewers, caves, and all those dark holes where the crustacean remnants tried to pretend they weren't home. In short: if something survived the slaughter on the surface and hid in a cesspool, the Guard was there to make them realize that was a fatal mistake.\n\n​Neo-Geneva, 2590\n​Vice Admiral Lena Kowalska—the one who, in the current flow of time, was merely a ghost from a non-existent line—stretched lazily on the bed. Her muscles, still saturated with the Swarm nanites that had made her nearly immortal in that lost life, responded with rare lightness.\n\n​\"Jesus, I haven't slept this well in ages,\" she muttered.\n\n​Monika, smiling, stroked her hair.\n\n\"I cured you with orgasms,\" she laughed, and Lena responded in kind, feeling a momentary escape from the weight of her duties.\n\n​However, the reality of 2590 would not be ignored. Lena stood up and walked to the window, looking out over the panorama of New Geneva. The city glowed with billions of lights, and giant megatowers—each housing fifty thousand residential quarters—resembled gleaming stalactites piercing the eternally cloudy sky. Though humanity now numbered forty-six billion souls, only a few, like her, had the right to full technological immortality. For Lena, even when the Swarm nanites in her body stop working after a thousand years (per the agreement) and death awaits, her consciousness copy will be printed in a new shell. She touched the back of her head, feeling the terrestrial equivalent of the implant. For the rest, thanks to medical advances, the average lifespan was 156 years—a respectable age, yet still only a blink compared to the thousand-year eternity granted by the Swarm nanites.\n\n​She went outside, heading toward the command quarters. Rain drummed against her jacket, and LED advertisements reflected in the puddles, creating a mosaic of colors reminiscent of tales of old Los Angeles. Above her head, amidst the clouds, giant holographic fish and predatory advertising slogans from Imperial corporations darted by, fighting for the market and customers as fiercely as in the days of the conquest.\n\n​\"Live on Mars! The Sky Dome awaits!\" one sign proclaimed, a reminder of the six billion people living under the \"Sky\"—a giant canopy rising 500 meters above the planet's rusty surface.\n\n​\"A New Start in the Empire! Become a farmer, find peace!\" another ad tempted with a safe life under Taharagch patronage, where citizenship, an implant, and a consciousness copy were guaranteed by Imperial decree.\n\n​\"Europa: a view of Jupiter you never dreamed of!\"—this invitation to the colony on the icy moon shone the brightest. That colony was for the elite.\n\n​Lena raised her head. Above the neon glow sat the Moon—its surface, scarred by centuries of ruthless resource extraction by Ullaan micromachines, looked different now. Residential domes had risen in giant craters, housing a total of seven hundred and thirty million people.\n\n​Passing through various sectors, Lena felt the vibrations of Imperial transport ships, whose 300,000-ton hulls cut through the space above the city, preparing for jumps through the \"Needles\"—the gates that made the galaxy smaller, but also more dangerous.\n\n​She reached the armored doors of the command quarters. She opened them and stepped inside.\n\n​Springfield, Mars\n​The evening in Springfield had a specific, neon hue. The apartment was high up, in the heart of one of the millions of colossal pillars supporting the \"Artificial Sky.\" Through the panoramic window, rows of city lights and the blue glow of lakes—which had begun to fill Martian basins thanks to ongoing terraforming—were visible.\n\n​Kael lay on the wide bed, watching the woman standing with her back to him. Her black hair cascaded down to her waist, contrasting with her fair, warm skin. As she turned slowly, removing the last scrap of black lingerie, her shapely breasts quivered in Mars' light gravity. A goddess, Kael thought, unable to tear his eyes away from her perfect lines.\n\n​She approached him with a grace most colony residents lacked. When she touched his chest with her hand, he felt a shiver. He had almost forgotten what it was like to be touched by soft, warm-blooded flesh, rather than the hard, cold scales he had grown accustomed to during sex with Ta’hirim.\n\n​She mounted him confidently, her hips moving to the rhythm dictated by desire. Kael felt a sudden surge of strength. In this relationship, for the first time in centuries, he could allow himself to dominate. He wouldn't have stood a chance against the powerful, heavy body of a Taharagch female—their bones were denser, their muscles built for high-G combat. Here, however, he dictated the terms. He flipped her over abruptly, gripping her long hair, and entered her from behind. Her cry, high-pitched and purely human, echoed off the walls of the luxury apartment.\n\n​As she collapsed onto the sheets, her body still wracked with tremors.\n\n\"Kael... your females... these bodies feel orgasms in such a strange, intense way,\" she whispered, trying to catch her breath.\n\n​\"Just wait, my love,\" Kael murmured, sliding his hand over her smooth back. \"I’ll show you something else in a moment. You’ll like it, I promise.\"\n\n\"I don't have the strength anymore...\" she sighed, but fascination lanced through her voice.\n\n​\"You wanted to see what it was like to make love to me in a human, female body yourself,\" he reminded her with a smile. \"Get used to it. This is the 'Ferrari' of shells that Imperial credits can buy.\"\n\n\"Ferrari, Kael?\" she repeated the new word tentatively.\n\n\"It’s the name of a legendary, exclusive vehicle from ancient Earth. A symbol of luxury and speed,\" he explained, moving lower.\n\n​He spread her legs with a decisive motion and began kissing her thighs, moving toward the center of her womanhood. He felt a hot, pulsing heat there, so different from the cool cloaca hidden beneath scales that he had known before. He laughed softly, tasting her.\n\n\"You’ll have to get used to the fact that in this version, you’re weaker, physically dependent on my movements.\"\n\nHe didn't stop, and she arched her back, digging her fingers into the mattress. For her, this new, delicate body had become a playground she hadn't dared dream of in the Imperial offices. Ta’hirim, a greedy Imperial official once sentenced to death but saved by the successful smuggling of Wolkow, was now discovering the world anew in her human skin.\n\n​That same evening, deep in a bar in Springfield, where synthetic cigar smoke mingled with the smell of cheap alcohol, one of the patrons slammed his fist on the counter, his eyes glued to the news screen.\n\n​\"For fuck's sake!\" he roared, loud enough to make several people turn. \"This pathetic pre-election government won't even get diarrhea without checking the polls! They won't pass anything new because they're afraid their numbers will drop half a percent. Marcus Thorne? A son of a bitch, I won't deny it, but at least he didn't fuck around when new colonization projects needed approval. Wolkow, grow a pair of balls, man!\"\n\n​The bartender, wiping a glass with a dirty rag, glared at him and set the vessel down with a thud.\n\n\"Shut your mouth and don't provoke people, 'cause you don't know shit,\" he cut in icily. \"Marcus was a sociopath who sent two hundred million people to the grave during the Spark Uprising pacification just to keep his order. All those 'great' military projects of his were built on corpses and slave labor. My father told me how my grandfather worked his fingers to the bone for that bastard, 16 hours a day until he dropped dead from exhaustion.\"\n\n​The bartender leaned against the bar, his gaze hardening.\n\n\"I listened to those stories as a kid, and now, as I stand here, I’m ninety-eight years old. And every day I thank Wolkow for toppling that prick. Hell, both pricks, counting the one that crawled out of that time anomaly thinking he’d grab us by the throat again. So drink your beer and be glad you even have the right to sit here and complain instead of rotting in some ditch for the 'sake of stability.'\"\n\n​The patron pushed his half-empty mug away, his face contorted in a grimace of rage.\n\n\"What the hell are you babbling about? Watch the tap and stop pissing people off!\" he barked, pointing a finger at the bartender. \"Marcus did what he had to so we could survive as a species! If it wasn't for his iron fist, there wouldn't be a bar here today—just a pile of rubble and lizards!!\"\n\n​The bartender didn't flinch, though his grip on the glass tightened.\n\n\"Stop making a scene!\" he snapped. \"Or I'll help you find the exit!\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, hundred-year-old geezer?\" the patron mocked. \"You look okay for your age, but I’ll snap you like a twig.\"\n\n​The bartender sighed, as if this happened every night. Without looking at the customer, he called toward the kitchen:\n\n\"Ti’rach, could you come here for a moment?\"\n\n​Through the small serving window, amidst the steam of fried meat, the massive head of a male Taharagch emerged. His dark, shimmering scales reflected the neon light of the bar.\n\n\"What’s wrong, boss?\" the cook asked. His voice was unnaturally low and raspy, sounding like giant stones grinding together.\n\n​The bartender turned back to the customer, who suddenly seemed to shrink in his chair.\n\n\"Finish that beer before Ti’rach carries you out,\" the bartender said calmly. \"He’s exceptionally patient and calm for a 'reptile.' But that doesn't change the fact that if I ask, you’ll land on the rusty pavement faster than you can curse.\"\n\n​The patron growled under his breath, staring at the remaining foam. \"Fine, fuck... A 'Plague' on Mars, goddammit, and he probably has a residence permit,\" he muttered, using the old, hateful term that the Swarm had officially erased from the definition of threats, replacing it with the name Taharagch. Though he significantly lowered his tone out of fear of the consequences.\n\n\"Ti’rach, it's nothing. Everything's fine,\" the bartender said, returning to polishing the counter. \"Back to work.\"\n\n\"Sure thing, boss,\" the lizard grunted and disappeared back into the clouds of steam.\n\n​At that moment, Jimmy and Lyra burst into the bar, both in civilian clothes.\n\n\"Holy shit, Kael actually lives here?\" Jimmy said, looking around in disbelief.\n\n\"Yes,\" Lyra replied. \"But in the Pillar, in a premium apartment. He even has his own landing pad right above the dome. Ever since they pulled Wolkow out, they’ve been basking in an Imperial pension for 'services to stability.'

That was when Lyra had decided she wanted to be with him; he had seen it then, in her terrified eyes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Feeling_Pea5770/comments/1q0ow3x/the_swarm_volume_4_chapter_13_rapid_reaction/", "score": 4, "num_comments": 0}}
{"keyword": "Project Jupiter", "item": {"title": "Year in Media - 2025", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PydraxAlpta/comments/1q09px5/year_in_media_2025/", "subreddit": "u_PydraxAlpta", "created_utc": 1767176184.0, "selftext": "# 2025 Year Media Review\n\n## Chaos Child\n\nI finished this game at the very start of this year, and for the most part, I had finished most of it in December. I should have written this review ages ago, and yet I am here writing it now when I remember the least. But what I will not forget is that this is easily the best storytelling that the Science Adventure series has offered to me.\n\nTakuru Miyashiro is a really fun character. He's a really well done representation of the annoying redditor teenager, whose worldview consists of categorizing people into those on the \"correct\" side and \"wrong\" side. He believes that most people do not question their reality, most people just accept what media tells them, they do not introspect what their stories tell them. He has a partner in crime in Shinji Itou, and another in Serika Onoe. Together they try to find solutions to disturbing news that comes up on their equivalent of 2-chan, and avoid the class president, Nono Kurusu, who would prefer they rather work on the school newspaper and other low stakes work.\n\nThe Re New Gen killings make for an excellent target for him and his group to look into. During which, we meet a couple more relevant people, Hinae Arimura, a student from their school who gets locked in with a victim; Uki Yamazoe, a girl taking care of the elderly in a facility; and Mio Kunosato, who is researching Gigalomaniacs for her own purposes, and working together with the police detective Takeshi Shinjo, officially assigned to the RNG killings. Chaos Child is a direct followup to Chaos Head, unlike most of the other games in the series which so far have been separate stories. It follows years after the events of the game, whose details are now not known in full to people - but the effect is of a ruined city trying to recover from a severe tragedy - The Shibuya Earthquake.\n\nThe core appeal of the Chaos Child story though, doesn't lie in the mystery itself, at least to me. The main crux of it working so well comes down to the ways in which it writes Takuru's relationships with his family. Takuru lives alone in his trailer parked in an area for rehabilitation of the victims of the Shibuya Earthquake. While Takumi would live alone because he wanted to spend all his time online, Takuru broke away from his orphanage/dorm because of being unable to believe in his family. His family being, Kurusu Nono, and three other members of the Aoba dorm. The ways in which Takuru's conflict between his desires and Kurusu wanting him to be safe and come back to the family unravels over the story is one of the strongest parts.\n\nThe second core appeal comes down to the true nature of the culprit. This is entirely impossible to write without completely spoiling, so I'll state what I liked in vague ways. Fundamentally, it's all about making the video game narrative of Chaos Child possible, in order for the player to be able to experience Chaos Head again. This would be a terrible thing given I don't like Chaos Head, but there's enough stuff that makes it good. And secondly is the relationship between the culprit and whom they did it all for. Because it's what gives them purpose in the first place.\n\nThe common route is the best part of the story, but there's some decent stuff in some of the character routes as well. But for the most part, they don't add as much to the whole thing, though I liked Kurusu's route. I have mixed feelings about the True Ending, which has some good stuff for the main duo, but the presentation of the CCS and overall return to conspiracy land that SciAdv loves to be in is annoying.\n\nThis is a minor thing, but the \"gameplay\" of choosing things on the corkboard or map is pretty okay and that is more positive than what most of this series can be. The game still takes ages to skip through for the routes, which sucks.\n\nAll in all this is the best that SciAdv has offered to me. Hope to read the next entry in the story this year... Whenever that happens.\n\n## I Saw the TV Glow\n\nA movie that I probably need to watch again to better understand, but it's a very miserable (positive) look into the life of a person who isn't able to come out and also about how if you look back at your favourite stuff from childhood you will be extremely disappointed. There's a lot more to this movie, but I want to be able to talk about it better, perhaps on a re-watch.\n\n## Monogatari Series Final Season\n\nThe \"Final\" Season of Monogatari Series, and I think this is the best one to me. While Second Season definitely has a lot of highs and Koi is really good, I just cannot help but love the heck out of Sodachi Oikura, who has completely changed my opinion on this series from distant to begrudging acceptor of the fact that I have become a fan of this series. Aside from her, Oshino Ougi is also really great, and I also appreciated Mayoi's role in her arcs. Zoku is also a pretty good conclusion to the arc, though it's maybe a bit too windy and long. Araragi Koyomi, is unfortunately, really good and his story is going to remain with me.\n\n## NSO: Typing of the Net\n\nThis is a strange side-game for Needy Streamer Overload. It is a typing game, with meme terms as the words or phrases to type and you have like three levels to beat. What? Just three? That doesn't sound very good. And that's because it kind of isn't. This game is a front for the actual mini-game, which is unlocked by entering a code in the search bar. It's a peculiar existence, alright. The typing game itself is a bit of a challenge to get the time on for achievements, but also it was patched to be a little easier after release by allowing you to make more mistakes if you want, though you still need to make next to none if you want achievement scores.\n\n## NSO: Endless Nightmare\n\nThis is a platformer mini-game inside of the above, and it is the actual meat of the package. There's some depth to the movement and mechanics, and the overall objective is to see Ame-chan go wild with a Chainsaw, become Kawaii Angel-chan and defeat Dark Angel. Fun. But... I feel like unless the main game is on sale, it's probably not worth picking up unless you are a NSO fanatic lol. Still, it was pretty fun, but has like next to no replay value.\n\n## The NOexistenceN of you AND me\n\nThis game is a little weird. It's kind of really cheap? So I picked it up because of seeing the main girl on steam's point shop. It is pretty experimental and has some nice ideas, but lacks key substance to hold it together and I'm not sure what exactly it wanted the player to understand from it's waxing philosophy. There's a song that uses AI-generated lyrics for a joke fight? Which is a bizarre choice and I think the rest of the game was also crowdfunded? It's so odd. It's like if a game was made by a fan of visual novels, but wasn't quite clear on what to make. I do think it's earnest in it's love for VNs and silly RPGs, and I just want to be nice to it for trying.\n\n## Anamnesia - part 1: am i my body?\n\nA cool VN made by Toaster, about a cybernetic future where humans have been microchipped from birth and use it as memory. Really look forward to it continuing, the main character is fun and the themes are neat. Always a fan of anything my friends make, and this one is definitely really well made.\n\n## Lost Highway\n\nI kind of don't remember this movie well. I think it has some ideas, but I wasn't paying a lot of attention and it wasn't that intriguing. This isn't a real review of it's merits, since I don't feel it's fair, but I didn't really get grabbed by what was going on in it.\n\n## Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance\n\nThis movie is kind of miserable. It's a revenge story about a guy whose kid is kidnapped by two people who are struggling to meet ends, and his kid dies due to the kidnapper's mistakes, who also faces losses of his own in the process. There are themes regarding capitalism and stuff, but it's just too miserable of a watch to really appreciate.\n\n## The Flowers of Evil (manga)\n\nA manga about perverted kids and being social outcasts. It has an enjoyable dynamic between the main three in the first arc, and the overall arc of the protagonist through the second half is also pretty cool. I feel it could have done more but I think I liked what it did with the main characters and an overall story around adolescent coming of age and kids dealing with complicated feelings towards romance and sexual emotions, as well as being able to connect with others over hobbies and wanting to escape. Definitely have to read more stuff from this author.\n\n## Clinical Trial\n\nA pretty cool indie horror rpgmaker game about having an unprofessional relationship with your practitioner. It has pretty good dialogue writing and I liked both the characters a lot. The ending split is a little iffy and I have love and feel that you are not supposed to take the \"good ending\" at face value, but I understand why someone would be turned off by it. Still a pretty cool game that I think deserves attention for the way it writes adhd, trauma (both sexual and religious).\n\n## Welcome to the N.H.K. (anime)\n\nI think it was pretty good overall! Definitely a recommend to watch if you're a fan of the concepts in stories like Chaos Head about the ways in which society affects those who enter it and don't succeed at it, and this pathetic NEET guy who breaks down when in public from the sheer terror of being perceived by society. And this girl who wants to help someone pathetic, because she's :). One point of note is that I am a fan of the original LN, and I think the LN does it's own content better than the anime. Instead, the anime kind of shines in it's own new content in the form of about three or four arcs that are exclusive to it, which explore some other characters from the background of the LN instead, and honestly does them pretty well too. At the core of it, the story I recommend to experience continues to be the LN - that is the one that covers the slow descent of Satou and his failed attempts at getting better and handles his and Misaki's relationship in a way that I liked more. But the anime is also a good story to experience in it's own right, and I think either order is fine, but neither is a replacement for the other. Of course, be prepared for some tws if you are going to experience it including depression and suicide.\n\n## Psycho (1960) (movie)\n\nA movie that is so close to being sympathetic to the mentally unwell that it hurts that the best thing I can say about it is that it's well shot and significant to movie history. It's sequels that are much less well known thankfully give us a lot more from Norman Bates and his motel.\n\n## Paranorman (movie)\n\nA stop motion style comedy animated movie, about a kid who can talk to ghosts. It has a pretty fun story with a witch who haunts the city because of being ostracized into death as a kid, and is pretty sympathetic to her, but kind of ends up both-sides-ing the ending to my chagrin.\n\n## Psycho II (1983) (movie)\n\nThis is a sequel that wasn't asked for. But I'm so glad it exists. It's a color movie, so it shows that over 20 years passed between the last movie and this one. It feels like that in universe too, where Norman has been freed from jail and is trying his best to have a normal life. And this movie is so good at showing how the mentally ill and past criminals are harassed and it leads to repeated incidents. It's wild how this movie exists and provides sympathy without trying to make Bates into a \"all good now\" person. There's some bits that I didn't like but overall it's a really good followup that makes watching the first one worth it.\n\n## Doki Doki Literature Club\n\nFinally got around to this one. It's good! I think Monica is the main draw for good reason but it's overall a fun game. It has some cool themes and definitely is too short and fast paced, but it does what it wants to really do well. I do want to get to Plus's extra content eventually, but I did like playing through the original (twice) and get the true ending. The real reveal to me is that the author is also known for being part of developing Brawl's Project M mod and I also listened to a podcast-video of him and Kosmic exploring the game design of the first super mario bros game.. like. This is a game design core guy who's made the most famous (probably) visual novel which is quite funny to me.\n\n## American Psycho II: All American Girl\n\nA very bizarre sequel that wasn't asked for, and an overall okay thriller movie. It's kind of funny though, so give it a watch.\n\n## Psycho III\n\nA third one? It's also overall good, and it continues the cycle of people messing with Bates. It's not as great as II is, but there's still good stuff to be had, and it concludes Bates arc with his trauma and I like it as well. For now, he is free.\n\n## Kollywood The Game (watched)\n\nA short game that is like a series of QTEs in between cutscenes about a guy becoming powerful like a kollywood hero, and then waking up and finding it was a dream. I watched Rosa play through it, it was cute, like one of those old flash games.\n\n## Needy Streamer Overload (replay-watch)\n\nA game about trying to become the world's most popular internet streamer in a month. And about completely failing to do that and struggle with severe mental issues. I watched Rosa play through this one and I also went back to finish the last remaining endings in it myself a few months before, it's a cool simulator game if a little jank at times. My favourite part of the experience was watching Rosie keep replying to every single one of Ame's replies until she stopped even though it's only necessary to reply to the first one, and completely avoid \\*\\*\\*. This is so mean to Ame. It's a very aesthetic VN/game and wouldn't be the same without it.\n\n## Psycho IV\n\nThe last one concluded his arc so well, so where do we go? For some reason, to the past where Bates originally killed his mother. While not a bad choice in of itself and there's some potential with the ideas it has, it just lacks so much that I can't in good faith recommend this one. It makes references and callbacks to the original movies without understanding why they were good, and just leaves you mad because it could have been at least decent.\n\n## World of Goo 2\n\nA sequel that I took a while to get to because it wasn't on Steam yet, and I did enjoy my time with this one! There's some fun meta-gaming ideas in one of the later worlds, and I wish there was more of this game, but I'm glad with what we have. I think I prefer what 1 did with the themes, but the gameplay is pretty innovative in this one and I think both games are a worthy play.\n\n## Video Game High School\n\nI had seen episodes from this before way ago in a TF group-watch but it took me this year to finally watch it whole with Rosa. Season 1 is pretty fun if nothing special it's so cool to have a school to become good at video games!! Season 2 steps up with the character writing and is less consistently funny but the characters are cool. S3 is definitely the strongest part and the way it shifts in tone from the serious event really makes it a good show. It's a short series but I definitely enjoyed my time with it and it's cast and the themes around parenting, coming of age and dealing with loss. And how video games are really cool.\n\n## Sanabi\n\nA very fun fast paced platformer slasher game where you have a hookshot arm and you swing your way to victory. Great music, challenging (but adjustable) gameplay and a pretty good plot that's delivered through intentionally slowing down your pace, I really like this one. There's also a DLC where you play as one of the bosses in a past incident, and while I prefer the main game, I really enjoyed my time with it too. The characters are fine but I really liked one of the reveals in the ending that emotionally connects the game together. It has a cyberpunk style, with the setting being a corporate owned town that's currently entirely empty and only inhabited by robots and two people, you and your partner Mari (and her partner robot). The protag is an ex army general and has a tragic backstory where Sanabi has taken away his beloved ones, and is on a revenge mission to find Sanabi at the root of the operation. Easily one of the most fun ways I've seen a leitmotif used in a game, will remain one of my favourite platformer games for a while.\n\n## Flow (movie)\n\nA movie made in Blender, a software I had the fortune, or misfortune, of having to learn and use for work. It's very pretty looking, and has a very fun \"no words\" story to tell and makes for a nice watch with family. Found family themes anyone?\n\n## BanG Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!\\\n\nA girl band show! I haven't watched many girl band shows, all things considered. If anything, I've watched an idol show as a kid, Pretty Rhythm. Conceptually, girl band shows are simple. Teenage girls struggling with life, but loving music. Some conflicts in trying to make the band, some issues with having to deal with real life on the side. Maybe some rivalries with other bands or between members. Or so I think, since I've not seen many, and at best played a very small chunk of the one from Colorful Stage. In some manners, this isn't too far from what Bang Dream MyGO is. But it's not that simple. MyGO is a story about lost children, these group of girls who (or at least most of them) tried to become a girl band before and find happiness. In a bang dream world, everyone around you is trying to make girl bands. It's not a unique thing or even a struggle to keep up a group of interested people. So many people in this world just want to play music that in a class you could randomly pick 5 people and you'd be able to form a band because they are all interested. So trying to form a band isn't even a way to express yourself or take the road not taken. Instead, being a band is trying to do the normal thing.\n\nOne of the ways you can read into the way bands are presented in this story is like relationships. Crychic, the original band formed by Sakiko, is quite the picture of a \"normal band\". Good at what they are doing, have their fans, have their critics. Nothing major. A normal relationship. There's some noise around you, there's people who go woah nice. But suddenly, it falls apart. A complete breakup, and even a \"I never enjoyed being part of this\" too. And we are left with the rest who do not understand what went wrong. Was it them? Was it because they weren't enough? Can something happy last? Is it all transient? (Now, most relationships don't have 5 people and I don't think the band metaphor only works for poly relationships, and I'm sure you can read it more platonically and less romantically and all.)\n\nLet's look at each moving piece of this story individually. First up, the people who remain, and the people who left, and finally, those who came after. At the heart of this story is Tomori. A girl who is extremely autism coded, struggles to put out her feelings, and writes her thoughts in her notebook as poetry, which get turned into Crychic's songs. And in their songs, she sings. Or she talks. Screams. It's something that is best experienced, and is easily my favourite part of their songs, because it truly expresses the core of the nature of this show, about being lost and unable to find solace in the normal. She does not sing like a normal singer would. Because she sings out her heart and that is the only way her feelings can come out. Taki has a very clear crush on Tomori, and her main draw to the band was being able to be with her. And Soyo, she was here for Sakiko, the one who helped her feel wanted. And when Sakiko breaks up the band, they can't help understand what went wrong.\n\nSakiko Togawa is a dominant presence throughout this story, and yet, this story isn't exactly about her. And yet, it couldn't be about anyone but her. She is the actor in the sidelines, a person whose choices are unknown to us, and yet she leaves everything behind burning. The looming question throughout the show in your head is, why did she do it? Mutsumi Wakaba, her friend does not say a lot, and finds herself pushed around by the two factions trying to keep making up, before deciding that she doesn't want to do this anymore.\n\nThe lead-up to all this is where the fuck does Anon or Raana come into the picture? And the reality is that in some way, they don't. Anon just happens to find Tomori in her class as she transfers into her school (at an odd time for some reason), and Raana wants to do nothing but play guitar at the play where they all meet up. And yet, despite being external to this conflict, this story wouldn't happen without them. They are catalysts, if somewhat chaotic in their own ways. Anon wants a band, she wants the fame, she wants to be known, and she wants to be the center of the group. She isn't the center of the group. Raana wants to play guitar, and she just finds these people interesting. Because to her, someone about to get out of middle school, these failing high schoolers are much more cool to see than the expected normal that she sees so often being always around the music studio.\n\nThrough a series of back and forth's, they manage to make a band, finding compromises to make everyone willing to play. And again, Sakiko Togawa's presence in their audience breaks them up again, like a lingering desire that won't be met without her. It takes them another series of hardships to finally come to an acceptance of where they stand, and what they want in order to live normally.\n\nThe thing about writing this review is that I feel I could drone on about these characters a lot, and I think I should, but that's for another time. It's MyGO is a show that connects these people and their struggle to have a normal life, with suspiciously recurring side characters that will be our secret weapon for the next time. What's this, another new band coming up, and they are about to have the biggest opening event ever? And they are all masked? Who could these people be...\n\nIt's easily one of the best anime I watched this year, and yet, it's not the best one because there's a new stage to reach, and okay I can't keep this up Ave Mujica exists and I have to talk about it in a bit in it's review but that does not take away from that MyGO is really cool too! It has some really good moments and I love the cast so much. It just doesn't drive me crazy like it's followup that spirals you to doom.\n\n## Gris\n\nA very pretty game, that mostly consists of walking to the right (or left) and solving minor puzzles, with a underlying story told without words. It's neat, I think more things like it should exist.\n\n## Animal Well (All Eggs)\n\nA platformer game where you are a very cute small blob, whose \"metroidvania upgrades\" are toys. Very fun, and there is a lot more depth to the game that I ended up doing, but I am satisfied with finding all the hidden eggs and one of the hidden rabbits. The game is so efficiently packaged at it's ridiculous file size that it makes me appreciate the layers and the game design a lot. Definitely a solid recommend for anyone who likes platforming games.\n\n## Deltarune Chapter 3 &amp; 4\n\nAfter a long wait, we have the true release of Deltarune itself, as a 4 chapter package. Deltarune is an interesting game because while I was playing it I just wanted to get over it and be \"finished\" with it so I can read people talking about it... I hate when I am playing things to keep up with other people. I do think I don't \"enjoy\" playing Deltarune that much as much as like thinking about it because it's a very cool game to think about and it's not without backing it up with stuff from the game itself. Maybe because I've not kept up with my bullet dodging skills... I didn't beat the secret bosses of the third and fourth chapter that said, and definitely didn't do the \"Weird Route™️\" so I do think I need to go through the game more to properly comment on it better.\n\nThat said, I think Chapter 3 is pretty fun in concept but less fun to actually play through, the characters are top notch and I really liked the directions it took regarding slowly unveiling more and more of Kris' trauma that manifests in the form of their TV becoming a dysfunctional character.\n\nChapter 4 is definitely my favourite of the two, both the light world and dark world segments are pretty good and I love the bosses. Susie's arc is endearing to follow and Gerson is certainly a very nice part of the chapter. He's old! The story ramping up has me excited for Chapter 5, and I hope I have played through what I have not currently in this game by then.\n\n## Fleabag S2\n\nI took a very long gap between watching episode 1 of this and the other 5 seeing as this is such a short series. It's pretty good, the humor is great and I liked Fleabag and the priest both. I think I liked how S1 hit with the reveal about Boo and stuff a lot more, so this season is more consistent and the other has higher highs. Still, it's such as short season that Fleabag might as well be a one anime cour, so it's overall a pretty good show for the size.\n\n## Haikyu (re-watch)\n\nI think I will never start S2 at this rate if I keep re-watching S1... I watched it with Rosa, and it had fun moments. I think I didn't feel it to have issues as much as I did last time, but it still didn't really grip me with the characters, maybe because it has a tendency to solve internal conflicts pretty quickly. Overall a fun watch, and the songs are pretty catchy. Oikawa is also pretty fun.\n\n## Katana Zero\n\nA 2D platformer-slasher where the protagonist takes a drug that lets them loop through time until they leave no trace. I had it on my lookout because Sanabi comparisons, and I can definitely see those as apt given the cyberpunk style and themes. It's pretty fun and some parts can be frustrating, but the game gives you enough tools to get through things with enough skill. I did like Sanabi more overall but this is also pretty solid and I think there should be more games like these. I hope to keep playing more cool platformer-ish games!\n\n## Ave Mujica - the die is cast\n\nThis one was a surprisingly lengthy watch, because my group with whom I also watched MyGO with, realized that there are better subtitles coming out for the show and we decided to slow it down so we can maximise the amount we could watch with the new subtitles. And wow.\n\nBang Dream It's MyGO is a show about struggling to meet the normal. It's about failing to have normal relationships and struggling with aftermaths of bitter breakups. The members of Ave Mujica have no trouble with the normal. It's not necessarily easy for them, but individually they are quite capable of meeting their goals and performing. So when they come together to form \"the greatest band ever\" (not in universe term), their ideals clash and one member reaches their limit.\n\nWe start by elaborating on where MyGO ends - with the formation of Ave Mujica, and the reveal the Sakiko is not currently rich, and lives with a single dad who is not very sober. Sakiko's reason for the band breaking up become a lot clearer when revealed: in order to make ends meet, she can no longer practice with the band and have a normal life. And yet, she has not given up her dreams. So she fights using her credentials as the heir of Togawa in order to arrange the band to end them all, and make it big by herself, without choosing to abandon her father and live with her grandfather. She has a grand plan as to how to lay out the lore of her band, performing stage plays before music, a masquerade to hide their identities as dolls discarded by humans.\n\nUnfortunately, she's the only one who really cares about their lore. And Nyamu, who would rather be publicly using her face as part of the band to raise her publicity, wants to get rid of the masks as soon as she can, and she does, messing up Sakiko's plans and actively breaking the one thing that let Mutsumi perform on this huge stage - not being her identity as the daughter of a famous actress. The other two are less directly affected, but one of them is more interested in being there for Sakiko, and for the other, it is just another band.\n\nWhat follows is the breakdown of Mutsumi Wakaba to the point where she is no longer able to keep up the front of her self. Instead, one of her dormant personalities now comes to the front to handle life instead, the front who is much more able to deal with people, who takes the name Mortis, after her stage name. Mutsumi/Mortis's struggle continues to be the main front of the story, and it partially culminates in getting together with ex-Crychic members, closing Sakiko's tale. Unfortunately for them, Ave Mujica is not just the two, and it must go on.\n\nTimoris, or Umiri Yahata, has one friend, Taki. And when Taki pushes her to think whether she was really a part of the band if she can move on that easily, she springs to action like a shounen protagonist gathering his team. Umiri finds herself unable to be trusted, because of her individuality and finds herself in multiple bands in a \"uncommitted\" manner. She doesn't get too involved with any one thing, because putting herself into something causes others not to keep up with her, and hurt her terribly when younger. And yet when challenged about her commitment, she has no choice but to bring everyone together, and prove that she can be trusted. She's also very funny. And the band gets together again, everything is happy, and once again everything breaks apart... This is like MyGO again!!!!! This time it's a different Togawa, and the truth behind the life of one Uika Misumi that leaves her with no choice but to leave this life behind. What follows is Timoris' \"trauma\" and another ordeal for Sakiko, in order to get the band together.\n\nAnd yet, at the end what we are left with, isn't a happy solution. It's a workable one, where the parties have accepted to work together, but their core issues haven't been resolved. It's an unsatisfying ending, because these people couldn't be satisfied with being together like this. They still have more to figure out, and maybe they won't be able to stay together for long again. It's an unstable equilibrium, where given a sufficient push, it would fall apart like a stack of cards again. And yet they strive to make it, because this is all they have.\n\nAve Mujica is a very strange band girl show, about extremely messy emotions and deep issues, and trying to form something big in spite of those odds, and failing to do so. It's hard to conclude thoughts about this show, because I really like all of it's cast, again. It's a show that will stay with me for a long time, perhaps forever. \"Will you give me the rest of your life?\" Sakiko Togawa asks, not her friends, but the viewer, who once accepts the contract by watching even a single episode, forfeits their life to thinking about her story for the rest of their life.\n\n## Shapez Archipelago Randomizer\n\nI played through an Archipelago Randomizer with my friends, with me playing Shapez. Well while it was pretty fun overall, shapez breaks pretty bad into an idle game if you don't get it's tools in the normal order through progression, though I liked having to come up with creative ways to meet my targets. Probably would choose some other game if I did a similar thing again.\n\n## The World God Only Knows S1 (anime) (re-watch)\n\nI decided to rewatch this show that I had watched back in 11th grade with Rosie, because I \"tricked\" her into thinking it's similar to Welcome to the NHK. Overall, it is pretty fun, it is definitely flawed and has a limited view of romance, but I can't help but appreciate the \"monster possession as mental issues\" concept (gotta love Monogatari) and that it tries a bit with it. Ayumi and Mio's arcs are okay, fun but not very deep but they are more so setup for the story. Kanon's arc has some cool ideas and it does do them, but it really doesn't like to address the elephant in the room that is idol culture. Shiori is oomfie as fuck and honestly the end of it being romantic is weird but I guess because it leads to Goddesses I will let it slide.\n\n## Strange Jigsaws\n\nA fun short game, where you solve meta-style jigsaw themed puzzles, with layers of the game being unlocked as you progress more. Definitely worth a play, especially at it's low price. One of the group of puzzles is literally drawings made by their kid, one of them is a text adventure game, one of them is a joke on \"saw\" and workplace safety. Very cool, and I do think I'll play through it again.\n\n## Make Love?! God!!\\\n\nA short one shot that is basically the prototype for TWGOK. It's like if the first few arcs were merged into one. It's not that great.\n\n## The World God Only Knows S2 (anime) (re-watch)\n\nThe second season! I think it's pretty comparable to the first one but overall the girls have more complete arcs comparable to that of Kanon and Shiori from S1, so it feels better. Chihiro is my favourite from the group, and I think there's some potential with Kusunoki but Jun is so awkward. I still like them though &gt;_&lt;. Overall I do feel like the arcs being adapted makes the anime for S1 and S2 the definitive way to experience the stories, as opposed to Goddesses which jumps through the arc to make it into one season. Ayumi getting some stuff by returning in Chihiro's arc was also nice. Haqua is also cute but I wish they did more than just tsundere tricks with her after the capture.\n\n## TWGOK OVAs - 4Girls and an Idol, Magical Star Kanon, Tenri Arc\n\n3 Short OVAs that add in arcs from the manga that didn't get adapted in the main story. Tenri Arc is basically part of Goddesses, so I'll review it as part of that. 4Girls and an Idol is a short look into the 2-B Pencils getting ready for their exams in order to be treated as a valid club. It's cute, there's some differences in how mean it is to Elsie with some jokes (it's nicer to her ^_^, if barely ). Magical Star Kanon is a Kanon/Elsie focus spinoff where Kanon has a run in with a weaker spirit who makes her into a child and thus she has to work with Elsie as Kanon and herself as a fan turned mini idol. It's cute I guess.\n\n## Ocarina of Time Randomizer\n\nDid a small target (20 triforce pieces) one to refresh myself over how this game played. It still isn't up to my preferences, and I think I'd have to do a normal playthrough to judge it again properly. It's still a very impressive PC Port, and the QoL selectable definitely makes it the best way to play OoT if you don't have the 3DS version.\n\n## Majora's Mask (PC Port)\n\nA replay of Majora's Mask, which I had originally played the 3DS version of. The PC Port definitely has what it takes to be the definitive version for the N64 release. I am a MM3D defender, but I think given the accessibility of 3DS games these days, I think playing this version is probably the best. You can also enable some 3DS stuff after all.\n\nMajora's Mask is one of the best games of all time, and definitely my favourite 3D Zelda game. And while I enjoy playing LTTP and LBW a lot more, I think the storytelling and world of Majora just can't be beat.\n\n## Santosh (2024)\n\nA movie that didn't pass the Indian Censor Board, probably because it's Drishyam on steroids when it comes to portrayal of the police and the ways of discrimination in this country at the rural stage. Definitely worth a watch. It doesn't have any standout characters as much personally because it's very focussed on feeling like a clear look into the disgusting reality of the systems that exist to oppress and control minorities.\n\n## Higurashi: Demon Exposing Arc (manga)\n\nA spin-off manga arc that originally interested me but later lost steam and went in a very different direction from what I would have liked. It opens with an interesting concept of the discrimination of the Hinamizawa's residents when they immigrated into other communities, because of the news surrounding their now dead village in this timeline. But the murder mystery plot and it's solutions were very weird to me, feeling thematically out of place with what Higurashi is.\n\n## Higurashi: Beyond Midnight Arc (manga)\n\nAnother spin-off manga. Another \"post hinamizawa disaster\" timeline. This time, we have a bunch of people return to the village in search of some things, getting stuck in the village with an overall interesting horror mystery. It has a supernatural tinge to it, but still pretty fun. Liked its themes and story a lot more than the other.\n\n## The World God Only Knows - Goddesses Arc (anime) (re-watch)\n\nThe anime adaptations of the first two seasons were very faithful, and kept both filler chapters and main chapters at full pace, even extended some parts to flow better. However Goddesses is not like that, instead it is a last ditch attempt to give this series closure in the form of adapting it's then ongoing arc, but it's not in a flawed manner. There's some changes made, such as combining the roles of two characters into one or removing the other one from some scenes in order to fit her being removed, but I don't think it hurts it by doing so. Goddesses is definitely the best season of the show, and the shift in focus and overall seriousness is done pretty well without losing what makes it funny. Katsuragi Keima is easily the best part to me, but I think Chihiro, Ayumi are also great. Yui and Shiori are also good though I think I prefer Yui's main, unadapted arc more. Tsukiyo and Kanon are fine. Tenri/Diane in the show ends up a bit less unique because goddesses are the main focus so she retains her uniqueness for a lot less longer, but I think she's nice too. The ending with Chihiro makes me so sad.. I'm glad I ended up revisiting this show with Rosa.\n\n## The World God Only Knows (manga)\n\nBecause I was enjoying the anime so much, I decided to catch up with the entire Goddesses arc in the manga before I started it, and I'm glad I got most of the way there. The manga is definitely worth reading the finish what isn't there in the series, especially the actual conclusion after Goddesses and the arcs before it. Overall my opinions on the arcs is overall the same between the manga and the anime, so I'll just cover the manga exclusive conquests in order, and talk a bit about the final arc. Tsukiyo's arc is fine, I don't think there's much standout in it. Minami sucks why is there an arc dedicated to Keima grooming her junior. Rieko is a really good concept and I'm glad it exists I like to think about it sometimes because of the themes of isolation of outliving your peers. Sumire has a fun story that didn't need to end in romance imo. Nanaka is also similar in that manner but gotta love shogi girl. Jumping ahead, Hinoka is the author's disguised fetish but there's also plot setup to goddesses in there. Akari is fun and so weird. The best part is Yui whose arc starts with her being a sheltered girl who runs into Keima and then is locked into her home which is like fine but then transforms entirely when Keima and Yui swap and oh god do I love both of their sides. It is so funny that becoming a girl specifically makes galge expert Keima into a otome fan. She's so cute. Yui starting to wear masculine clothes after the arc ends is also so great I love them both. The Heart of Jupiter arc, that finishes the series is where we start to bend time itself, and understand that Keima is truly a god of this universe. Some of the Urara stuff goes crazy, and Dokurou is also a cool concept. Kaori is girlboss and I like how she bets against Keima being a good person in her tactics, making her an interesting foil. The goddesses trading around child keima is so stupid. Overall the arc is fine I think I liked Goddesses more overall.\n\n\n----\nContinued in the comments due to size limits", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PydraxAlpta/comments/1q09px5/year_in_media_2025/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2}}

I want to share my experience and see what the similarities are, as well as maybe get some answers.\n\nTo preface, I’ve learned that the commonalities between the “chosen” were some sort of childhood trauma or near death experience. I had both before the age of 5. \n\nIn kindergarten, me and 13 other kids were enrolled in the “STAR” program. I’ve tried to talk to former classmates about it, but no one remembers much. We were pulled out of our classes in the middle of the day and taken to a portable building behind the school (no windows) where the lights were usually off or dim. We learned about planets, space, stars, etc. I don’t remember who the teacher was, but they weren’t apart of the normal school staff. We were assigned a planet, and had to give a presentation on it (mine was Jupiter). We gave a lot of presentations, but that’s the only one I remember. When we weren’t discussing space or whatever, they would put on a video. I don’t remember the video, but I do remember falling asleep a lot. \n\n1st-3rd grade is when the G.T. stuff took full swing. They had weeded out some kids and added others, but I always stayed. We regularly went into the portable building one by one, where I swished a pink liquid and was told to close my eyes and listen to some auditory noises through headphones. I remember always being really anxious before going in. They would ask me what I saw, as well as some weird ones like “what’s the color of sound?” and “Can you see your house from here?” I also remember the 1-1 testing with flash cards and inkblot tests. \n\nIn the group, were given a sheet of paper with random shapes, letters, and numbers, and told to use our imagination and turn the objects into something; I turned the number 4 into a rocket ship. We did a lot of speed reading, decoding worksheets, puzzles, and a lot of “find the needle in the haystack” activities. It always felt extremely pressured and competitive. \n\nThe testing stopped after elementary school, but did it? When we started taking the state tests, the GT kids were all put in 1 room together, all the way up until we Junior year. When we were grouped for projects and chosen for classes, we somehow always ended up in the same space. I was office assistant in high school, where I learned that if we were in the GT program, it was permanently on our student record. \n\nAfter doing some research on the GATE program, I now know that most of this is standard. But why do I not remember most of my childhood? What was the STAR program? Why were we selected? Are we meant for something greater, just chosen for an experiment, or truly gifted and talented?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GATEresearch/comments/1q01dll/so_what_was_the_point/", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2}}

Between finding[ more articles](https://nypost.com/2019/07/31/another-dog-dies-after-mri-at-long-island-vet-owner-claims/) and discovering things like they're private equity owned I researched the below and am interested on if this makes sense. I do want tips on how I can avoid becoming victim of another private equity owned vet though.\n\nI’m seeing some comments here trying to downplay the issues at LIVS by saying \"all vets get sued\" or \"people are just emotional.\" That is technically true, but it misses the point completely.\n\nI dug into legal filings, annual reports, and corporate records going back about ten years to compare LIVS to the Animal Medical Center (AMC) in NYC. When you actually look at the volume of patients vs. the *type* of lawsuits, a really ugly pattern shows up at LIVS that simply does not exist at AMC.\n\n**The Data: Volume vs. Allegations**\n\nFirst, you have to understand the scale difference. AMC is the \"Amazon\" of veterinary hospitals. They are massive. LIVS is a large specialty center, but they are significantly smaller.\n\n| |**Animal Medical Center (AMC)**|**Long Island Veterinary Specialists (LIVS)**|**Sources**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Annual Caseload|54,417 visits (2023 Verified)|\\~15,000 visits (Est. based on staff/facility ratio)|[AMC 2023 Impact Report](https://www.amcny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AMC_AnnualReport2023_072904_Issuu-final-edited-1.pdf); LIVS volume est. \\~25% of AMC based on facility size.|\n|Staff Size|140+ Veterinarians|**\\~**30–40 Veterinarians|[AMC \"About Us \"](https://www.amcny.org/meet-amc/about-us/)vs. [LIVS \"Careers\" Page](https://www.livs.org/careers).|\n|Ownership|Non-Profit / Teaching Hospital|**Private Equity** (NVA/Compassion-First)|[AMC Non-Profit Status](https://www.amcny.org/); [Compassion-First Acquisition](https://www.sgep.com/company/long-island-veterinary-specialists).|\n|Primary Lawsuit Type|Negligence, Slip-and-Fall, Employment|**Systemic Fraud, Unnecessary Surgery, \"Upselling\"**|See breakdown below.|\n\n**The Volume Mismatch (Why this matters)**\n\nIf complaints were simply a result of \"doing business,\" AMC should have 300% to 400% more fraud complaints than LIVS because they treat four times as many animals. They do not.\n\n* AMC Lawsuits are often operational. Someone slipped on a ramp, or a doctor made a specific mistake.\n* LIVS Lawsuits differ fundamentally. They aren't alleging \"mistakes.\" They are alleging intentional deception. The complaints consistently claim that doctors are fabricating diagnoses to force owners into unnecessary $10,000 procedures.\n* The Lawsuit Comparison\n\nI dug into the court dockets to find specific examples. The pattern holds up: AMC gets sued like a corporation (HR, accidents), while LIVS gets sued like a business trying to maximize revenue.\n\nAMC: \"Big Company Problems\"\n\n* *Rodrigues v. Animal Medical Center* (2020): A premises liability suit where a woman tripped on a ramp. Standard insurance claim.\n* *Chiaramonte v. The Animal Medical Center* (2014): An Equal Pay Act/HR dispute.\n* *Gale v. Animal Medical Center* (2013): A malpractice suit where the plaintiff *tried* to claim fraud. Outcome: The court dismissed the fraud claim but allowed the malpractice claim to proceed.\n* *Takeaway:* Even when people try to sue AMC for fraud, courts usually say \"No, this looks like a medical mistake, not a scam.\"\n\nLIVS: \"The Money Grab\"\n\n* *Lehr v. Long Island Veterinary Specialists* (The \"Oscar\" Case): The plaintiff alleged his dog had simple arthritis, but LIVS staff physically forced the dog into an MRI machine to bill for the scan, paralyzing the animal. They then tried to sell him spinal surgery to fix the injury they caused. This is an allegation of racketeering/upselling.\n* *Zabary v. Long Island Veterinary Specialists* (2019): A small claims suit regarding overpayment and billing.\n* *Adesso v. Long Island Veterinary Specialists* (2014): A suit demanding a refund after a cat died, claiming services weren't rendered.\n* *Takeaway:* These suits are consistently about transactions: refunds, overpayment, unnecessary procedures, and fraud.\n* The \"Business Model\" Problem\n\n**The root of this might be the ownership structure.**\n\n* AMC is a Non-Profit: It's a teaching hospital. Doctors are typically salaried or on academic tenure. There are no shareholders demanding quarterly growth.\n* LIVS is Private Equity: LIVS was acquired by Compassion-First, which was later absorbed by NVA (National Veterinary Associates). In this model, \"revenue leakage\" is the enemy. This incentivizes a culture where conservative treatment (rest and meds) is discouraged in favor of the \"Gold Standard\" workup (MRI + Surgery).\n\n**Does LIVS do \"more\" fraud? The data says yes.**\n\nLIVS has a specific, recurring pattern of allegations that AMC simply doesn't have: The prioritization of profit over medical necessity. AMC makes mistakes characteristic of a giant hospital. LIVS faces accusations characteristic of a predatory business. The lower patient volume at LIVS combined with the higher intensity of \"fraud\" accusations strongly suggests that unnecessary procedures are a feature, not a bug, of their operation.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/y0ni11tx00bg1.png", "score": 23, "num_comments": 2}}

Check out the pinned comment to see the top 25 authors with the most total nominations.\n* The best new addition to the list was **The Stonewater Kingdom by Rachel Gillig (#17)**. Other top new additions were **Wolf King by Lauren Palphreyman (#20)**, **Alchemised by SenLinYu (#22)**, and **The Everlasting by Alix E. Harrow (#23)**.\n\nWe weren’t able to run all rank changes this year because we don’t have access to last year’s data, but hopefully rank changes will be back next year!\n\nIn the next few weeks, we’re going to run a survey to put together a guide for the top books on this list that will hopefully provide the community with more information about the books.

A few days ago part of this conversation previously unknown to me was brought to my attention, viz. the paper (if it is that), “[AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/).” I’m not sure if this can be called a paper properly speaking; it’s more like a fictional scenario, but the authors take pains to point out that there is a great deal of research behind their scenario. (There’s a [half hour explanatory Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KVDDfAkRgc) about it with more than nine million views, which is a good indication of the impact this scenario has already had.) AI 2027 appeared this year. Max Tegmark’s book *Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence* (I mentioned this in a footnote to [newsletter 356](https://mailchi.mp/1b22042bb877/the-view-from-oregon-356)) appeared in 2017, and it too included a fictional near-future scenario of the appearance of artificial superintelligence (ASI). (Another fictional portrayal of ASI is in the third season of Westworld, in which the ASI is called Rehoboam, though this is made to serve the interests of the story and isn’t intended to make a point about ASI.) I find it interesting, and perhaps significant, that both Tegmark’s book and AI 2027 choose to cast a superintelligence scenario in fictional terms. It seems that fiction communicates the urgency the writers want to express better than a traditional scientific paper. It would be interesting to inquire why that is. (If we’re going to talk about ASI in terms of fictional scenarios, why don’t we discuss the James P. Hogan novel *The Two Faces of Tomorrow* or the aforementioned Westworld season?)\n\nBoth the AI 2027 scenario and Tegmark’s scenario start with machines that are specialized in coding, because this has an immediate connection to recursive self-improvement. A machine that could improve its own code could produce more advanced iterations of itself, but there is little intrinsic relationship between coding and other cognitive tasks that a machine might take over. There are many examples of this. A simple pocket calculator can outperform any human mathematician in adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, being both faster and more accurate. Contemporary chess programs can outperform chess grandmasters, and the best Go players have been beaten by computers, but the programs that do this can’t do anything else, just like a pocket calculator can’t do anything but a handful of arithmetical functions. To observe that specialization in one area of cognition does not necessarily translate into competence in another area of cognition immediately suggests the question of how tightly compartmentalized any form of cognition is or can be, and this in turn suggests the modularity of mind hypothesis.\n\nEarlier this year when I did a lot of reading in psychology (I was helping a friend teach a class in psychology by giving guest lectures) I got deeper into the modularity of mind than I had previously and I came to appreciate its connections with Aristotelian philosophy of mind and Freudian psychoanalysis. Previously I had been skeptical, but my skepticism was primarily a function of my having encountered vulgarized versions of the modularity of mind; Fodor’s original book is quite good and quite reasonable, and not something radically new (as I just noted, it is continuous with themes in Aristotle and Freud) that can’t be assimilated to the long tradition of philosophy of mind. But modularity of mind became so popular for a time that it was treated as gospel and I always find this sort of thing repellent. I’ve read books and papers that refer to it as though it were the only conception of the mind on offer, and this isn’t going to help anyone understand the problems that a philosophy of mind is trying to solve and what other theories have had to say about these problems. \n\nIn any case, the question of the compartmentalization of cognitive skills is immediately posed by AI/AGI/ASI scenarios based on optimizing coding skills and assuming that a superhuman coder is going to drag all other competencies along with its coding competency to the point that the inevitable result is a machine, “eclipsing all humans at all tasks” (in the language of the AI 2027 scenario) or “capabilities… far beyond human” (in the language of Tegmark’s scenario). If this is what’s expected from ASI coders, is this what we find with the best human coders? I don’t think it’s unfair to ask whether the best human coders exemplify the virtues of renaissance men, not only turning their hand to any task, but excelling beyond others when they do so, being essentially Nietzschean supermen walking among us, and I don’t think this is generally observed to be the case. What one often finds is that the world entire is interpreted through the lens of computer programming, as the early modern miller Menocchio framed his cosmology in terms of cheese and worms (cf. the PS to [newsletter 370](https://mailchi.mp/a40fab3210d4/the-view-from-oregon-370)), seeing the world entire through the lens of his profession. One sad truth that we all eventually learn that is a great deal of human cognition is opaque to itself more often than not. An individual can be a brilliant physician or engineer, but be completely incapable of bringing this brilliance to other areas of their life, including framing a conception of the world entire.\n\nThe [AI Futures project](https://ai-futures.org/) responsible for [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) has issued a [statement](https://superintelligence-statement.org/), admirably kept to a single sentence, which is this:\n\n&gt;We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is\n\n&gt;1.      broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and\n\n&gt;2.      strong public buy-in.\n\nWhile it’s admirable that they’ve been able to keep their recommendation to a single sentence, this has got to be one of the most ludicrous proposals for stifling scientific research that I’ve seen. Apart from the obvious problems in attempting to enforce any kind of ban on research, there is the equally obvious problem of drawing a distinction between ASI research and AGI research or, for that matter, any computer research whatever. I would call this a particularly egregious form of “maxipok creep.” [Nick Bostrom formulated the maxipok rule](https://existential-risk.com/concept.pdf) such that: “Maximise the probability of an ‘OK outcome’, where an OK outcome is any outcome that avoids existential catastrophe.” This sounds reasonable enough, but the interpretation of it tends to creep until we’ve painted ourselves into a risk-averse corner from which we have no way out. If building big, fast computers is interpreted as a potential existential catastrophe, then our future “OK outcome” will be humble indeed.  \n\nThe trivial argument to make here would be to argue that banning ASI research is a slippery slope precisely because a clean distinction can’t be made between ASI and AGI, and between AGI and any computer research whatsoever, such that a ban on ASI research would ultimately and eventually mean a ban on any computer research at all, which would either make us Luddites or fools, since stopping all computer research would mean an end to any futher development in computing, while knowing that we needed to stop all computer research or risk everything and still failing to do so would mean our doom. I call this a trivial argument because we could set limits, however imperfectly, and we could establish conventions that would allow us to distinguish between computer science *simpliciter* on the one hand, and, on the other hand, AI, AGI, and ASI. The distinction need not be a crisp, clear demarcation; it only needs to be close enough to get the job done. \n\nThe substantive objection is that those who talk about AI, AGI, and ASI don’t really know what they’re talking about. Here we run into a problem that is neither technological nor philosophical, but sociological, or, if you prefer, spiritual. One must be careful to not appear dismissive, since those who define themselves through the identification of such risks will point to your failure to share their judgment as to what constitutes a risk as a sign of *your* failure to understand. Part of the difficulty in discussing AI, AGI, and ASI risk is that the idea has so taken over the discussion of existential risk that this one concern has crowded out almost everything else. Those researching this risk would likely argue that this is due to the very real risk that the technology involves, and not to any social contagion. But having existential risk research turn into a bandwagon that everyone jumps on, or everyone feels the obligation to jump on for fear of being left behind (or, perhaps more to the point, for fear of losing their funding), furnishes the social proof that all human beings desire, but also ironically itself constitutes an existential risk. If a society has a community of persons tasked with assessing and mitigating risks, and this entire community focuses on, say, insect infestations, one might see this as a comparatively trivial preoccupation that is consuming social resources that are supposed to be devoted to non-trivial risks.\n\nI propose another way forward. I suggest that we ought to make an effort—not coupled with any ban on scientific research, but in parallel with research that is going to happen anyway, like it or not—to clarify our concepts in regard to AI, AGI, and ASI, so that we know ourselves to be talking about the same things if regulation should ever prove to be necessary. I can imagine something like the [International Commision on Stratigraphy (ICS)](https://stratigraphy.org/) that formulates and regulates the geological time scale, setting standards for naming and re-naming subdivisions of geological time, or the [*Bureau international des poids et mesures (BIPM)*](https://www.bipm.org/en/) that maintains the standards of the metric system. We could have an International Commission on Cognition (ICC, not to be confused with the International Criminal Court or the Interstate Commerce Commission) that defines key terms for AI/AGI/ASI research.\n\nThe rub is that this can’t be a purely scientific undertaking. Defining the terms related to AI, AGI/ASI would be a task deeply enmeshed with philosophy of mind. Fortunately, we wouldn’t have to agree on any metaphysical conception of the mind. We merely need to have a common language (ideally, a formalizable language that can be integrated seamlessly into the formalizations of the natural sciences) in which to discuss the mind. That are many areas of human life that are deeply enmeshed with traditional philosophical problems—it was, after all, human life that suggested these philosophical problems—and we nevertheless find a way of going on about the business of life without having agreed beforehand on any overarching metaphysical framework. We could do this with mind also, though the challenges are greater, because, even setting aside metaphysical disagreements, merely agreeing on the concepts to be employed in the description of cognition is controversial.   \n\nThat the ASI community is trying to match three pounds of homegrown wetware powered by pizza and hamburgers with acres of data centers and billions of dollars ought to be your first clue that something doesn’t quite add up. It’s somewhat like the race to build a marine chronometer, which was pursued with large mechanisms for many years, until John Harrison built a marine chronometer about the side of a large pocketwatch. It would be not only an ironic outcome, but a real existential threat you could say, if any prohibitions on the development of ASI ended up crippling an industry even while other and more imaginative researchers ended up producing ASI in their garage by formalizing and mechanizing the actual processes of human thought rather than mimicking them on a grand scale.   \n\nBest wishes,\n\nNick\n\nPS—Last week I asked the question, “Is origins of life an intrinsically planetary-scale process?” and I suggested some mechanisms that point to this being the case. I’ve just realized that an important distinction needs to be emphasized throughout any such discussion, a distinction between boundary conditions and specific mechanisms. The specific mechanisms that result in the origins of life may not involve the boundary conditions that made it possible for the specific mechanisms to produce life, and certainly it won’t involve *all* the boundary conditions. It may be the case that the entirety of the universe is the boundary condition for life to arise on Earth, but the mechanisms on Earth that resulted in the origins of life don’t need to invoke the origins of the universe, which are among the boundary conditions for life.  \n\nWhen positing an unfamiliar idea (I haven’t heard anyone else ask, “Is origins of life an intrinsically planetary-scale process?” so I assume that it’s at least somewhat unfamilar), one often has to go overboard in emphasizing the conditions and qualifications to which the idea is subject, which has the consequence of muddying the exposition. Since an unfamiliar idea shines best when its exposition is clean and uncluttered, the (obvious) conditions and qualifications are often passed over, which leaves what appears as a vulnerability that attracts trivial criticisms. This is probably a lot of what’s going on with the AI/AGI/ASI discussion.\n\n# Newsletter link:\n\n[https://mailchi.mp/35b5b0948371/the-view-from-oregon-373](https://mailchi.mp/35b5b0948371/the-view-from-oregon-373)\n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/The_View_from_Oregon/comments/1q2a6kx/artificial_superintelligence_slouches_towards/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0}}

I have ASD level 1, ADHD-I, motor dysgraphia, and 3rd percentile processing speed. My psychiatric illnesses are also generalized anxiety, social anxiety, PTSD, and major depressive disorder - moderate - recurrent. I'm posting because I've noticed an interesting phenomenon in my life where gaining more experience and/or \"life experience\" made things worse for me and not better. Of those mental illnesses I listed too, I developed all but social anxiety (had that in my teens) as an adult.\n\nThis has been an issue I can recall as far back as middle school. In middle school, I did cross-country, track, band, did two martial arts outside of school (9 years old to 14 years old before I quit) and was in the top 50 students for academics and invited onto the Washington, DC trip. I hated being the center of attention and to this day I dislike real life attention (positive or negative), albeit not as extreme as when I was younger. I say that because I had my first signs of not doing well with pressure to perform then. An infamous incident in my household occurred after my band teacher had me perform a solo for the auditorium and was a threat to myself. Fortunately, no one was called or anything like that at all.\n\nWhen I transitioned to high school though, I went to a tiny one that accommodates dyslexic and ADHD students and had a graduating class of 8 students. Since my high school didn't have any extracurricular activities or specialized advanced courses (no AP, IB, foreign language, or honors courses) and I was burned out of the martial arts school on top of coming hot off the heels of being a threat to myself, I dropped everything and only stuck to what I had to do for homework and whatnot. It was extremely liberating and I think in hindsight it was the liberation of extra pressures that helped a ton. To this day though, I do find it interesting how dropping the extra experiences where I apparently did well made me feel better. For most neurotypicals I've met, it's the opposite for them where they stick to the things they do well and sometimes brag about it.\n\nAs an adult though, I've had notable snafus such as not doing well for all of my degrees (Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD). My path was littered with issues and I don't have the independence expected of someone with a terminal degree and it all started back when I was an undergrad to the point I really only focused on classes and had one summer lab's worth of experience on top of the lab experience I had at a flagship university my senior year of high school for internship credit. For example, I struggled with labs in undergrad and grad school and had to get a ton of help from classmates and cohort members. The same happened with homework too. I also taught and had a downwards trend in ratings from 2s out of 5 on all categories to 1s out of 5 on all categories the final semester I taught. Most ADHD and AuDHDers are told to block off periods of time based on how much time they think they need, but I had to stop doing that and just say that I gave myself 7 hours to do what was on a weekly to do list given how often I couldn't estimate time and would panic if I did something for too long or didn't expect it to take that long.\n\nNotably, I had a life coach my parents hired for me to help me get through undergrad (notably, they didn't do my work for me. Just input on social situations and study skills) and a different coach who helped me with Master's and PhD applications. They also didn't do my work for me, but would give feedback and introduced me to others who knew a ton about graduate admissions so I could come back from my bad undergrad performance.\n\nI also have issues with learning new things. I've had a huge history of addressing feedback and then I get hit with \"not like that!\" quite often. That's a big part of the reason I only did the flagship projects (Master's thesis, qualifier project, and dissertation) all throughout my graduate education and no other additional research projects nor collaborated with anyone else. Others who've gone through a PhD find me missing those hard to believe, but it happened.\n\nWhen I look back at the adult issues, it was clear that I stuck to the bare minimum to be considered a full-time student in undergrad without any extra activities. I tried to resolve this in my PhD program, but I did much more than what was reasonable for me in hindsight. I should've also seen the teaching positions I took outside of my program as a poor fit coming based on the dislike for attention alone.\n\nWhat's even odder though is that many hyped up college based on my performance on tests and dual enrolled classes and said I'd learn a lot, mature a ton, gain confidence, and more. I haven't learned anything new really and have the lowest confidence I've ever had in my life after realizing that graduating with my PhD was just the final major failure in a lifetime series of failures. At the same time though, I don't want to really address the confidence issues because I'm moving on to a part-time data entry job with my home state sometime this month and a program for disabled graduates to hopefully get employed at Fortune 1000 companies. That's not a bad spot to be in and I'm not sure why I lack confidence other than realizing what doesn't work for me. Finally, others kept insisting to go on my path because \"I'd give up too soon as usual\" if I did so and they were convinced this was my path deep down. I don't feel that way any more.\n\nSo, why is it that more \"life experience\" has made things worse for me and not better like others said it would? More importantly, I don't know if I should prioritize confidence or not. Should I try to gain confidence after a lifetime of failure?\n\nEdit: Regarding my PhD, I'm well known on a lot of academic subreddits and someone who commented on my posts (who I now blocked) essentially summarized how everyone else felt about me getting a PhD, which was that my program did a disservice to pass me. The examples he gave were using my notes on take home exams during COVID when it was closed book without Lockdown Browser, advisors copyediting my papers and dissertation, not understanding how to write for different audiences, complete reliance on fellow students to keep up with course materials, trouble teaching, and more. This was echoed by a \\*ton\\* of users, especially when I used notes during those exams even though all other students in those classes did so because no eyes were on them.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1q29oc8/should_i_try_to_gain_confidence_after_a_lifetime/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1}}

But that pattern has changed: modern servers are drawing far more power, increasing cooling challenges for operators. ([Uptime Institute][1])\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 **Core Findings**\n\n### 🧠 1. **Server Power Consumption is Rising Steeply**\n\n* After stable power use through the 2000s and early 2010s, server power consumption has **risen steeply since the mid‑2010s**. ([Uptime Institute][1])\n* *External commentary on the same trend shows a **~266% increase in server energy use since 2017*** — highlighting how dramatically things have changed. ([DataCenter-Insider][2])\n\n---\n\n### ❄️ 2. **Air Cooling Limits Are Being Reached**\n\nTraditional **air cooling systems**, which have been the backbone of data center thermal management, are nearing their practical limits:\n\n* **Thermal power levels are approaching the maximum that air cooling can dissipate** efficiently. ([Uptime Institute][3])\n* Higher power outputs mean more heat, requiring larger heat sinks **and** more airflow — which increases energy use for fans and facility cooling. ([Uptime Institute][3])\n* In some servers, temperature requirements are now so strict that more aggressive cooling is needed, or standards (e.g., ASHRAE classes) need reconsideration. ([Uptime Institute][3])\n\n---\n\n### 🧱 3. **Silicon Thermal Characteristics Are Changing**\n\nThe report lays out that:\n\n* **Chip architecture trends** are leading to both higher power dissipation *and* lower allowable operating temperatures for silicon. ([Uptime Institute][1])\n* More powerful processors and accelerators (like GPUs) can produce more heat than typical air‑cooled systems handle efficiently. ([Uptime Institute][1])\n\nThe result? Rising thermal demand is creating a kind of **“Silicon Heatwave”** inside racks — a metaphor for overloaded cooling systems struggling to keep up.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ 4. **Impacts for Data Center Designers &amp; Operators**\n\nOperators face difficult choices:\n\n* Should facilities be **retrofitted or redesigned** to handle these hotter, more power‑hungry servers? ([Uptime Institute][1])\n* **Air cooling may no longer suffice** for future server generations, pushing toward **liquid cooling solutions** or more advanced thermal management strategies. ([Uptime Intelligence][4])\n* There is **uncertainty about future power and cooling requirements**, since chipmakers don’t always publicly share detailed future thermal profiles. ([Uptime Institute][1])\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 **Why This Matters**\n\nThe report frames this thermal shift as more than a technical challenge — it’s a **strategic industry turning point**:\n\n* Operators who ignore rising heat and power demands risk **higher costs, reduced equipment life, and efficiency losses**. ([Uptime Intelligence][4])\n* Facilities may need new cooling infrastructure, including **direct liquid cooling** or other non‑air methods. ([Uptime Intelligence][4])\n* The industry is starting to rethink long‑held assumptions about safe operating temperatures, efficiency goals, and sustainable design. ([Uptime Institute][3])\n\n---\n\n## 📈 **Broader Context**\n\nExternal commentary connects the report’s findings to industry trends:\n\n* Raised server energy use is intensifying **efficiency and sustainability discussions** across the data center industry. ([DataCenterNews Asia Pacific][5])\n* Government regulators and environmental planners are paying more attention to data center energy &amp; water impacts — potentially affecting future policy. ([ChannelConnect][6])\n\n---\n\n## 📌 **Summary**\n\n**Silicon Heatwave** argues that:\n\n* **Server power and heat output are rising rapidly**, beyond historical patterns. ([Uptime Institute][1])\n* **Air cooling systems are strained** and may soon be insufficient in many facilities. ([Uptime Institute][3])\n* **New cooling strategies are needed** for future data centers.

Books, podcasts, studies, youtube deep dives. The more I learned, the more I realized we're doing men dirty.\n\nSociety tells guys to be vulnerable, then mocks them when they try. We say \"show emotions\" but roll our eyes when they actually do. We demand they change but offer zero roadmap. Then act shocked when they spiral into depression, addiction, or worse.\n\nThis isn't a personal rant. It's about a pattern I kept seeing everywhere. Young men drowning in conflicting messages. Told their natural drive is toxic. Shamed for seeking purpose and strength. The data backs this up too. Male suicide rates are climbing. College enrollment dropping. More guys checking out of society entirely.\n\nBut here's what the research actually shows: The problem isn't masculinity itself. It's that we've stripped away healthy models and replaced them with nothing. Or worse, with Andrew Tate.\n\nAfter digging through everything from evolutionary psychology to modern sociology, I found frameworks that actually work. Not the recycled \"be yourself\" garbage. Real, researched approaches to building a life that feels meaningful.\n\n**Here's what actually helps men thrive:**\n\n**1. Find your purpose beyond proving yourself**\n\nMost guys exhaust themselves chasing external validation. More money, bigger muscles, hotter girlfriend. It's a hamster wheel that never stops.\n\nResearch from psychologist Barry Schwartz shows this achievement addiction leads nowhere good. You hit one goal, feel empty, then chase the next. Rinse and repeat until you're 45 wondering why success feels hollow.\n\nThe shift: Build your identity around growth and contribution, not outcomes. Jordan Peterson talks about this extensively. It's not about being the best, it's about being useful. When your purpose centers on solving problems and helping others, you become unfuckable with. External circumstances stop controlling your self worth.\n\n**2. Embrace discomfort strategically**\n\nComfort kills more dreams than failure ever will. Every guy I know who's actually happy regularly does shit that scares them.\n\nDavid Goggins (former Navy SEAL, ultra endurance athlete) built an entire philosophy around this. His book \"Can't Hurt Me\" is INSANELY good at explaining why our brains lie to us about our limits. He calls it the 40% rule. When your mind screams stop, you're only 40% done. Your body can handle way more than your brain wants to admit.\n\nStart small. Cold showers for 2 minutes. Having that difficult conversation. Hitting the gym when you'd rather scroll. These micro acts of courage compound. Each one proves to yourself you're capable of hard things.\n\nThe app Ash has solid guided exercises for building this kind of mental resilience too. Helps you work through the psychological blocks that keep you stuck.\n\n**3. Stop consuming, start creating**\n\nModern life turned men into passive consumers. Scrolling, watching, gaming, jerking off. All input, zero output. This creates a spiritual emptiness no amount of content can fill.\n\nDr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi spent decades researching optimal human experience. His concept of \"flow state\" shows we're happiest when actively creating something challenging. Not when we're comfortable. When we're stretched.\n\nBuild something. Write, draw, code, woodwork, whatever. Doesn't matter if it sucks at first. The act of creation rewires your brain. You go from spectator to participant in your own life.\n\n**4. Get your brotherhood sorted**\n\nLoneliness is killing men faster than heart disease. We're biologically wired for tribe and most guys have zero real friends.\n\nAnthropologist Jared Diamond's research on traditional societies shows men historically bonded through shared challenges and rituals. Modern life destroyed this. We interact through screens instead of experiences.\n\nJoin something that requires showing up. Martial arts gym, climbing crew, book club, volunteer work. Anywhere men gather around a shared purpose beyond getting drunk. These connections become your support system when life gets hard.\n\n**5. Master your energy, not just your time**\n\nProductivity porn has guys optimizing every minute but feeling exhausted. That's because they're managing time wrong.\n\nDr. Jim Loehr's book \"The Power of Full Engagement\" completely changed how I think about performance. Energy, not time, is your most valuable resource. You can have 12 free hours but if you're depleted, they're worthless.\n\nThis means: Sleep is non negotiable. Nutrition fuels your brain. Movement creates energy. Strategic rest prevents burnout. A rested man working 4 focused hours crushes an exhausted one grinding 12.\n\nTrack your energy patterns for a week. Notice when you're sharpest. Protect those windows fiercely. Schedule your hardest work then.\n\n**6. Rewrite your relationship with failure**\n\nMost men avoid trying because failure feels like proof they're inadequate. This keeps them stuck in mediocrity.\n\nCarol Dweck's research on growth mindset shows successful people see failure completely differently. It's data, not identity. Each attempt teaches you what doesn't work. You're not failing, you're iterating.\n\nThe podcast \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" has incredible interviews with world class performers. Common thread? They all failed spectacularly before succeeding. The difference is they kept moving forward.\n\nWhen something doesn't work out, ask: What did I learn? What would I do differently? How can I apply this next time? This reframe turns setbacks into stepping stones.\n\n**7. Build your mental fitness daily**\n\nYou wouldn't skip brushing your teeth for weeks. But guys ignore mental health until they're drowning.\n\nThe app Finch is actually great for this. It gamifies habit building and mood tracking in a way that doesn't feel like therapy. You care for a little digital bird that grows as you complete self care tasks. Sounds stupid but it works.\n\nBeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts that turns research papers, books, and expert talks into personalized podcasts based on what you're trying to figure out. Type in your struggle or goal, like \"improve confidence\" or \"become better at handling rejection,\" and it pulls from verified sources to create a custom learning plan with your choice of voice and depth. \n\nYou can go from a quick 15-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context depending on how much time you have. There's also a virtual coach you can talk to mid-episode if something clicks and you want to go deeper. Makes it easier to actually apply the research instead of just knowing it exists.\n\nAlso check out Dr. Andrew Huberman's podcast. He's a Stanford neuroscientist who breaks down the biology of mental performance. His episode on optimizing testosterone naturally is a masterclass in how lifestyle shapes brain chemistry.\n\nTen minutes of daily reflection makes a massive difference. What went well today? What challenged me? What's one thing I'll do tomorrow? Simple but it builds self awareness.\n\n**The bigger picture no one mentions**\n\nHere's what someone should've told me earlier: You're not broken for struggling. The system is broken for offering no guidance.\n\nPrevious generations had clearer paths. Mentor systems. Rites of passage. Defined roles. We dismantled all that (some parts needed dismantling) but built nothing to replace it. Now guys are expected to figure it out alone while being told their instincts are problematic.\n\nThe research is clear though. Men need challenge, purpose, and community. These aren't toxic traits. They're biological needs. When channeled constructively, they create scientists, artists, fathers, leaders, builders.\n\nWhen suppressed or misdirected? Depression, rage, and checking out.\n\nSo yeah, we should absolutely reject the toxic parts. The violence, the domination, the emotional constipation. But we can't throw out the entire concept of masculinity and expect men to thrive in a vacuum.\n\nThe guys who figure this out don't become alpha bros or doormats. They become integrated humans. Strong and sensitive. Ambitious and present. Confident and humble.\n\nThat's the goal. Not perfect.

It is relevant to BPs because wealth tax is currently discussed in California and Krystal has a lot of opinions on it. The first post containing the background of wealth tax discussion is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakingPoints/comments/1q0krii/background\\_on\\_wealth\\_tax\\_debate\\_in\\_the\\_us/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakingPoints/comments/1q0krii/background_on_wealth_tax_debate_in_the_us/)\n\nThe idea of taxing unrealized gains is relatively new in the US, but it has been tried in various European countries, with a decent amount of data that has been well studied by economists.\n\nFrance: Repealed the tax in 2018. Found that the tax generated very low revenue and caused significant emigration of high-wealth households, while reducing economic investment. After repealing the tax, economic investment began increasing.\n\nGermany: Suspended the tax in 1997. The tax was ruled unconstitutional due to inequities in valuation. It raised little revenue and was considered administratively unworkable.\n\nNetherlands: Abolished the tax in 2001 and replaced it with a presumed-returns tax.\n\nSweden: Abolished the tax in 2007. The tax resulted in capital flight, with many family-owned businesses relocating and other negative effects on entrepreneurship. The consensus is that it was economically harmful.\n\nDenmark: Abolished the tax in 1997. It resulted in low revenue and high avoidance rates.\n\nFinland: Abolished the tax in 2006. It produced minimal revenue with high compliance costs.\n\nAustria: Abolished the tax in 1994. It resulted in low revenue and a high administrative burden.\n\nItaly: Abolished the national wealth tax, but continues to tax targeted assets.\n\nSwitzerland: Still has a wealth tax at the cantonal level, similar to US states. It is generally considered a successful example of a wealth tax. Different cantons have different wealth tax rates, but all are relatively low, as they compete with one another to attract entrepreneurs. Strong enforcement and high compliance, in combination with low income tax rates, result in close to 1% of GDP in revenue. This is unusually high for a wealth tax, but still low relative to other taxes, income taxes raise roughly 8–18% of GDP.\n\nNorway: Still has a wealth tax. It is politically controversial and has resulted in increased migration of high-net-worth individuals.\n\nSpain: Has a temporary wealth tax after suspending it in the past. It raises low revenue and is largely politically driven.\n\nIn summary, from the above examples, professional economists are in broad agreement on the following three points when it comes to wealth taxes:\n\n1.       Wealth taxes raise relatively little revenue.\n\n2.       Wealth taxes are difficult to administer and result in high tax avoidance, including high-net-worth individuals fleeing.\n\n3.       Wealth taxes result in decreased economic investment.\n\nThe reason I am bringing all of this up is that, in the US, the discussion of wealth taxes generally does not include economic considerations at all. Few people are concerned with the actual revenue a wealth tax would generate, what it should realistically be used for, or the negative effects it may have on the rest of the population. Instead, the debate is often centered around whether someone likes or dislikes a particular billionaire, such as Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. That is the wrong way of thinking about it, and represents the worst side of populism in politics.\n\nCan wealth taxes work? Sure, depending on what you expect them to do. In my opinion, taxes are meant to raise revenue for the state and encourage economic behaviors that benefit the government and society at large. Wealth taxes have consistently been shown to be a poor and inefficient way of raising revenue, while also discouraging economic investment and entrepreneurship. That is what makes wealth taxes a bad idea, in my view.\n\nSome people see taxes primarily as a way to redistribute wealth, and wealth taxes tend to fail in this area as well. Where wealth taxes do succeed is in causing high-net-worth individuals to leave. If that is the outcome you are looking for, at the expense of everything else, then wealth taxes are indeed worth supporting.\n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WhoAteMySoup/comments/1q29cv8/us_wealth_tax_debate/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0}}

If those GDP contribution estimates are even directionally right, we’re looking at a growth mix increasingly dependent on one investment engine.\n\nThe bear case is also real: massive spend doesn’t automatically translate to broad productivity gains, and there’s a credible view that AI hasn’t materially lifted aggregate GDP yet. That gap (capex now, payoff later) is where bubble narratives, hardware bottlenecks, and policy/macro shocks can bite.\n\n## What to Watch\n- Whether AI capex plans actually stay near **$440B** into 2026 vs getting trimmed\n- Signs AI boosts broader growth vs staying concentrated in data center investment\n- Continued strength around **$NVDA / $AMD** as proxies for the cycle\n- Macro baseline: OECD sees **~2.9% global growth in 2026**\n\n---\n*What's your take?

This former Bob Baffert pupil will be the recipient of one of my favorite angles here as he will be dropping in class and cutting back in distance ... .Can make no mistakes here however.\n\n**2)** Although it might prove futile, I’m going to try to beat morning line favorite **My World** here. This $350,000 son of Essential Quality was visually impressive winning the Nashua Stakes on this oval last time. However, there was a dip in speed figure when stretching out in distance in the Nashua and it took him a pedestrian like (almost) :26 seconds to run the final quarter mile. \n\n**3)** After just one (excellent) race, I’m not exactly sure how good **Enforced Agenda** is just yet, but he could be very good. I loved the way he stalked a :45.3 half mile split (which is pretty quick on the Aqueduct surface in the fall) yet “inched clear” late, getting a mile (same distance in this race) in a very good 1:35.4. Moreover, he gets an attention getting rider switch. \n\n**Race: 7 (3:10 pm EST)**\n\n**Busanda Stakes**\n\n**1)** In mirroring my thoughts about Balboa in the Jerome Stakes, **Schilling** showed speed and tired in her last. However, she too will now be dropping in class and cutting back in distance here.\n\n**2)** In taking Schilling, **Britain,** a $1,050,000 daughter of Quality Road, scares the bejesus out of me. Yes, she was beaten fair and square by my top pick on Oct 16th, but she came roaring back, signaling much improvement, when decisively breaking her maiden in her last.\n\n**3) Believable**’s last race was too bad to be true. I expect a better effort from this $800,000 daughter of Curlin in this spot and Prat is your pilot. \n\nAlso consider: **Dazzling Dame** who is 3 for 4 in her career and ran a field high 90 Brisnet Figure in her last. \n\n**Gulfstream Park**\n\n**Race: 6 (2:48 PM EST)**\n\n**Ginger Brew Stakes**\n\n**1) Spirit Doll** cruised home in her turf debut while winning by 6+ lengths and getting a mile in a fleet 1:33.4. Moreover, in my “Race Inside the Race” examination, I saw this filly by Tiz the Law ran an opening half mile in :47.1, yet came home the second half mile in an even faster (:46.3)…THAT is doing some running.\n\n**2) Tide of Time** was beaten just over two lengths vs better in NY in early November and won her debut prior. The only question here is her fitness level as this will be her first start in 58 days.\n\n**3) Sister Trioenne** is your 8/5 morning line favorite and rightfully so after three “no doubt about it” wins in row ….two on the turf and one on the synthetics. This might be another race where trying to beat the favorite could prove futile.\n\n**Race: 10 (4:48 PM EST)**\n\n**Mucho Macho Man Stakes**\n\n**1) Commandment** is a well-bred (by Into Mischief out of Grade:1 winner Sippican Harbor), $500,000 colt who split horses down the lane to break his maiden by 5+ lengths and gets a serious rider upgrade.\n\n**2) Thunder Chuck** has run very well in three of his four career starts and had a legitimate excuse (overmatched at Saratoga) in the one race he didn't. \n\n**3)** Any young horse who can run 6F at Aqueduct in sub 1:10 *must* have some ability and that is exactly what **Epic Summer** did …in his debut no less. \n\nAlso consider: **Blame Yasself,** who although it took him a molasses like :14.1 to get the final furlong in his debut, showed guts/determination to hold on late for the win…Still another who gets a serious rider upgrade.\n\n**Oaklawn Park**\n\n**Race: 4 (2:28 PM)**\n\n**Renaissance Stakes**\n\n**1) Obliteration** returns to dirt where he owns a pair of wide margin wins and a close second to Kentucky Derby hopeful Ewing….solid choice here.\n\n**2) Strong Potential** closes and his running style suggests the further they go, the better he will be…but is 6Fs long enough?\n\n**3) Dirty Rich** has speed and the rail, which is always a dangerous combination. Colt by up and coming sire Thousand Words, comes into this off a really good effort/win in his last.\n\nAlso consider:  Longshot **How** **Bout** **That** **Curt**, who is 2 for 3 at Canterbury Downs. He may not be completely overmatched here.\n\n**Race: 10 (5:25PM)**\n\n**Smarty Jones Stakes**\n\n**1) Universe** won his debut, then chased three (second all three times) colts who look to be serious Kentucky Derby prospects, all in graded stakes races. He drops in class and it appears he meets no such rivals here.\n\n**2)**  **Sleepingonfreedom**, at 5-1 on the morning line, presents excellent value. This stretch running colt by Independence Hall is a half length shy of being unbeaten and his last race was much better than it looks on paper. He was completely blocked on the turn for home, over a sloppy track, but once he found a seam to run through, he was gone. \n\n**3)** The aforementioned **Rancho Santa Fe** was wide on the turn in both career starts but got up for the win both times, demonstrating determination and talent. We will find out more about this son of Tapit in this spot.\n\nAlso consider: **Boca Beach Club** who has closed well, late in his first two races and could relish the stretch out in distance………**Oscar’s Hope** is laudably consistent having never been worse than second in five career races….steps up here however……….So far, **Strategic Risk** has only run well at Gulfstream Park, including winning his last by wide margin. I wonder how he will do on this surface?\n\n**Santa Anita Park**\n\n**Race: 8 (6:30pm EST)**\n\n**Santa Ynez Stakes**\n\n**1) Explora** missed by less than a length in the BC Juvenile Filly race last time out…logical choice in a race I really don’t like being its yet ANOTHER Santa Anita short field, stakes race where Bob Baffert trains 50-75% of those entered and offers *zero* value.\n\n**2) La Wally**’s BC Juvenile Filly effort was too bad to be true… I expect a good, bounce back effort from this stretch running filly by Constitution here.\n\n**3) Revera** ran one of the best races of her short career at 7F….closes….could be coming late here.\n\nAlso consider: **Hikima,** a $900,000 daughter of Curlin, whose best distance appears to be 6F………..**Toaster**, a $525,000 daughter of up and coming sire McKinzie, won her debut and came home the last sixteenth in a good :06.2 seconds….she may not be completely out of this race.\n\n**Little Bets N Pieces**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* **Barnes,** who was purchased for $3.2 million at the 2023 Fasig-Tipton Saratoga yearling sale, has been retired to Hill ‘n’ Dale at Xalapa Farm in Paris, Ky., the farm announced on Monday.\n\nBarnes will stand for $15,000.\n\nBy Into Mischief, Barnes won 3 of 7 starts and earned $557,750. He was entered in Sunday’s Grade 1 Malibu Stakes at seven furlongs for 3-year-olds at Santa Anita, but was withdrawn because of a “setback,” trainer Bob Baffert said over the weekend.\n\nBaffert added that Barnes strained a tendon.\n\n“This truly was a major disappointment as we were expecting him to have a huge year on the racetrack,” Baffert said.\n\nJust FYI, Barnes has a half-brother in **All American Boy**, by Essential Quality, who has yet to race and worked a half-mile at Fair Grounds on Saturday.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* After a game win in the Grade 2 Laffit Pincay Jr. Stakes on Sunday at Santa Anita, trainer Bob Baffert said **Nysos** is on schedule for a start in the $20 million Saudi Cup at 1 1/8 miles on Feb. 14 in Saudi Arabia. \n\nThe Saudi Cup also is a possibility for Laffit Pincay Jr Stakes runner up **Nevada Beach.**\n\n“That was a good prep for both and for something bigger,” Baffert said.\n\nBaffert also has the Grade 1, $3 million Pegasus World Cup Invitational at 1 1/8 miles on Jan. 24 at Gulfstream Park as an option, adding that race could also be on the schedule of Goal Oriented, who won the prestigious, Grade 1 Malibu Stakes for 3-year-olds at seven furlongs at Santa Anita.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* Probable 2025 three year old champion male and possible 2025 Horse of the Year, **Sovereignty** will race as a 4-year-old, according to Godolphin USA director of bloodstock Michael Banahan.\n\nBanahan said that Sovereignty, who won the Kentucky Derby, Belmont Stakes and Travers Stakes last year, has been galloping in Lexington over the last few weeks and will join Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott's string at Payson Park Training Center in Indiantown, Fla., \"early in the new year.\"\n\n\"We'll get him with Bill and then roll on and hopefully have as good a year next year as we had this year,\" Banahan said.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* **Tamara**, the winner of the Grade 1 Del Mar Debutante in 2023 whose career was repeatedly delayed by injuries or illnesses, has been retired, trainer Richard Mandella said.\n\nAfter blazing five furlongs in :57.4 seconds on the infield training track at Santa Anita on Saturday, An injury was detected.\n\nMandella said post-workout X-rays were “clean, but she is off a little in her right front.\n\n“They’re planning to retire her, and I’m all for that,” he said. “It seems like there is a black cloud over her,” Mandella said.  “It seems like it’s been one thing after another.”\n\nTamara, who is by Bolt d’Oro out of four time champion Beholder, was targeting the G3 Las Flores going six furlongs at Santa Anita on Sunday.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/horseracing/comments/1q28wil/stakes_races_from_around_the_country_for_saturday/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0}}
{"keyword": "Doña Ana County industrial revenue bonds", "item": {"title": "JKHY, Jack Henry &amp; Associates | A Primer", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Compoundingcapital/comments/1q2a0vh/jkhy_jack_henry_associates_a_primer/", "subreddit": "Compoundingcapital", "created_utc": 1767386596.0, "selftext": "**Opening Orientation** \n\nThis entity functions as a specialized technological utility for the financial services sector. It operates the critical digital infrastructure that processes transactions and maintains the books of record for thousands of community and regional financial institutions in the United States. Its economic profile resembles that of an industrial toll road or electric grid rather than a volatile software startup. The business benefits from a regulated oligopoly structure and extreme customer inertia, resulting in highly predictable cash flows that are protected by the operational risk associated with switching providers. It creates value by acting as the outsourced information technology backbone for banks that lack the scale to build such systems internally.\n\n**Business Description and Economic Role** \n\nThe company provides core processing services, which serves as the central nervous system for a bank. This software maintains the general ledger, calculates interest, processes deposits and loans, and generates regulatory reports. A financial institution cannot legally or operationally function without a core processor. The company primarily targets community banks and credit unions with assets under fifty billion dollars, effectively ceding the largest national banks to competitors or internal builds. Customers pay this company to offload the massive regulatory and technological burden of maintaining a compliant banking stack.\n\nBeyond the core ledger, the business provides a suite of ancillary modules that enable modern banking. These include digital banking interfaces for consumers, payment processing solutions, and lending automation tools. The economic function is to aggregate research and development costs across thousands of clients. A small community bank cannot afford a hundred million dollar engineering budget to build a mobile app, but it can afford to rent one from this company. The customer is buying operational continuity, regulatory compliance, and a competitive feature set that allows them to survive against larger national rivals.\n\n**Revenue Model and Segment Economics** \n\nThe company generates revenue through three primary segments that work in concert. The Core segment creates the foundation by charging monthly subscription fees and implementation costs for the data processing system. This revenue is increasingly derived from private cloud hosting fees rather than upfront license sales. Once the core is installed, the Payments segment monetizes the volume of activity flowing through that system. This segment earns transaction-based fees for debit card processing, bill payments, and remote deposit capture.\n\nThe Complementary segment functions as a cross-selling engine. It generates revenue by selling specialized software modules that plug into the core, such as digital banking platforms and fraud detection tools. These are typically sold on long-term contracts with recurring fee structures. The consolidated revenue model acts as a layered annuity. The core system secures the customer relationship, while the payments and complementary segments increase the revenue per client through usage fees and add-on subscriptions.\n\n**Revenue Repeatability and Visibility** \n\nRevenue quality is exceptionally high and sits at the top of the obligation hierarchy. Approximately ninety-one percent of total revenue is classified as recurring. This predictability is anchored by multi-year master service agreements that typically span five years or longer. However, the true source of repeatability is operational rather than contractual. Replacing a core banking system is a high-risk and expensive undertaking that touches every aspect of a bank's operations. Consequently, client retention rates consistently hover near ninety-nine percent when excluding the effects of bank mergers and acquisitions.\n\nVisibility into future revenue is secured by a substantial backlog of contracted performance obligations. The primary threat to this visibility is not competitive churn but customer consolidation. When a client is acquired by a larger institution that uses a different provider, the revenue stream eventually ceases. While the company typically collects a termination fee known as a deconversion fee, this one-time cash infusion signals the permanent loss of a recurring revenue stream. The customer base is highly diversified, with no single client accounting for more than ten percent of revenue, which mitigates idiosyncratic counterparty risk.\n\n**Demand Physics and Customer Behavior** \n\nDemand for the product category is non-discretionary. A bank must have a core processor to maintain its charter. Therefore, the customer is structurally forced to buy from someone. For the specific choice of vendor, demand is heavily influenced by service reputation and cultural alignment. Community banks often view themselves as \"Main Street\" institutions and prefer a partner that mirrors their values, rather than a partner that focuses on global mega-banks. This creates a \"pull\" dynamic where existing customers actively seek new modules from the company to remain competitive.\n\nThe binding constraint on the business is the available market of banking charters rather than the company's ability to supply software. The number of financial institutions in the United States is in secular decline due to consolidation. Growth cannot come from a rising tide of new customers. It must come from expanding the share of wallet with existing customers. Friction for leaving is prohibitive. The pain of migration acts as a powerful retention force, meaning customers will rationally tolerate moderate price increases or service friction before risking a system change.\n\n**Competitive Landscape and Industry Conduct** \n\nThe company operates in a stable oligopoly alongside two larger competitors. These three firms dominate the market for core processing in the United States. Competition is generally rational rather than destructive. Price wars are rare because the decision to switch vendors is driven more by risk mitigation and functionality than by the lowest bid. The company explicitly differentiates itself on service quality and partnership culture rather than raw scale or lowest price. It wins by dominating the niche of smaller institutions that require high-touch support, a segment often neglected by its larger rivals.\n\n**Advantage Mechanisms and Durability** \n\nThe primary competitive advantage is switching costs. The integration of the software into the client's daily workflow and data history creates a barrier to exit that is nearly insurmountable for a rational operator. This is reinforced by high regulatory barriers to entry. Building a compliant core banking system from scratch requires navigating a labyrinth of federal audits and certifications, which deters new entrants. The advantage is durable as long as the underlying technology does not shift radically enough to make migration easy. The most plausible erosion mechanism would be a regulatory mandate for open banking and portable data, which would lower the walls of the garden.\n\n**Operating Structure and Constraints** \n\nThe business functions with significant operating leverage. The costs to develop and maintain the software platform are relatively fixed, while the marginal cost of adding a new customer or processing an additional transaction is low. This structure allows margins to expand as revenue grows. However, the business relies heavily on human capital to maintain its service advantage. Scaling the support organization to match the complexity of the product suite is a linear constraint. If the company fails to hire and train support staff effectively, the \"service moat\" degrades quickly.\n\n**Reinvestment Model and Asset Intensity** \n\nThe company is asset-light in physical terms but research-intensive. It does not require factories or heavy machinery. The primary reinvestment asset is the software codebase. The company must continually spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on research and development to modernize its technology stack and prevent obsolescence. A secondary but critical reinvestment area is cybersecurity. As a custodian of financial data, the company must invest aggressively to defend against breaches, which constitutes a mandatory license-to-operate cost. Expansion is modular rather than lumpy, allowing capital deployment to match demand without risky step-function capacity builds.\n\n**Capital Structure and Per-Share Integrity** \n\nThe capital structure is conservative and poses minimal risk to long-term equity holders. The balance sheet is characterized by a net cash neutral position, with debt used primarily as a temporary bridge for working capital or acquisitions. There are no complex financial instruments or maturity cliffs that could force dilution or distress. Management treats equity ownership as a scarce resource. Stock-based compensation is systematically offset by share repurchases, preventing the creeping dilution often seen in technology companies. The risk of financing-driven failure is effectively zero under the current policy.\n\n**Management Intent and Scoreboard** \n\nManagement defines the company's purpose as serving the community banking sector with integrity. They explicitly avoid the ambition of becoming a global payments conglomerate. Winning is defined by consistent, compounding returns rather than explosive top-line growth. The real scoreboard consists of earnings per share growth and return on invested capital. They consistently highlight these metrics and downplay bookings hype. Under pressure, management protects the dividend and the balance sheet, treating financial fortitude as a non-negotiable directive.\n\n**Capital Allocation Doctrine and Track Record** \n\nThe capital allocation doctrine is disciplined and follows a strict hierarchy. The first priority is organic reinvestment in the product. The second priority is a growing dividend, which has been raised for over two decades. Remaining cash is used for opportunistic share buybacks and targeted acquisitions. The track record demonstrates a refusal to engage in empire building. While competitors pursued massive, debt-fueled mergers that destroyed shareholder value, this company paid down debt and focused on organic cross-selling. This behavior confirms a mentality of rational ownership rather than size maximization.\n\n**Alignment and Incentives** \n\nThe executive team has a shared financial destiny with shareholders. The chief executive officer is required to own stock valued at six times his base salary, a high hurdle that creates material downside exposure. Compensation is heavily weighted toward performance-based equity, with payouts tied to relative total shareholder return and operating metrics. A notable feature of the incentive plan is a circuit breaker that reduces the annual bonus to zero if operating income falls below a specific threshold. This structure ensures that management is not paid for effort if the fundamental profitability of the business deteriorates. Executives are strictly prohibited from hedging or pledging their shares.\n\n**Earnings Power Interpretation and Normalization Choice** \n\nThe business is a linear compounder with low cyclicality. Therefore, trailing twelve-month earnings represent a credible baseline for valuation. There is no need to normalize for economic cycles because the recurring revenue model smoothes out volatility. The primary adjustment required to understand true earnings power is the exclusion of deconversion fees. These fees are one-time gains triggered by customer attrition. Relying on them overstates the sustainable run-rate of the business. A prudent investor should view the core recurring earnings, excluding these termination penalties, as the true economic engine.\n\n**Stage in the Business Lifecycle** \n\nThe company is in the mature \"Stable Yield\" phase of its lifecycle. It has saturated its core market and growth currently tracks closer to gross domestic product plus pricing power. The primary risk in this phase is the \"denial of age,\" where management might attempt to manufacture artificial growth through risky acquisitions. However, current behavior suggests acceptance of this maturity. The company is optimizing for margin and cash return rather than aggressive expansion. The most likely path forward is that of a \"Cash Cow\" that acts as a high-quality bond proxy with an equity kicker.\n\n**Principal Failure Modes and Tripwires** \n\nThe most plausible path to long-term impairment is the accelerated extinction of the customer base. If bank consolidation speeds up significantly, the addressable market could shrink faster than the company can cross-sell to remaining clients. This \"melting ice cube\" scenario would result in a permanent stagnation of revenue. Another failure mode is technological disruption from \"neocore\" providers who successfully lower the risk of migration. Early warning tripwires include retention rates falling below ninety-seven percent or organic revenue growth stalling below five percent. Such signals would indicate that the structural headwinds have overwhelmed the growth engine.\n\n**Overall Business Quality Assessment** \n\nThis is a Tier 1 defensive asset characterized by elite revenue quality and a wide competitive moat. It is a high-probability survivor that offers protection against inflation and economic volatility. The business is not suited for investors seeking hyper-growth or rapid multiple expansion. It is designed for long-term owners who prioritize capital preservation, steady compounding, and growing dividends. The durability of the franchise depends on the continued existence of community banks and the persistence of high switching costs. As long as these two pillars remain intact, the business should continue to generate superior risk-adjusted returns.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Compoundingcapital/comments/1q2a0vh/jkhy_jack_henry_associates_a_primer/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0}}

A new generation of “near-indestructible” alloys is now breaking those old rules, forcing researchers to rethink what metal can survive in jet engines, fusion reactors, and even the next wave of electric cars.\n\nnstead of one miracle material, I see a cluster of breakthroughs converging: ultra-tough high-entropy alloys that shrug off cracks, wear-resistant surfaces that barely erode, and superalloys that keep their shape at temperatures that used to be reserved for ceramics. Together they are redefining the limits of metal, and they are arriving fast enough that design assumptions in aerospace, energy, and transportation are already starting to shift.\n\n# How a “near-indestructible” alloy rewrites the rulebook\n\nThe [most](https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/97550-scientists-discover-worlds-toughest-metal-alloy#:~:text=OAK%20RIDGE%2C%20TN%E2%80%94Scientists%20have,most%20other%20materials%20in%20existence.) eye-catching development is a new alloy built around refractory metals, the elements that normally sit in furnaces and rocket nozzles because they tolerate intense heat but tend to shatter when stressed. Researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and several west coast universities have reported that by carefully mixing these refractory ingredients and tuning the internal crystal structure, they created a material that resists both deformation and fracture in ways that conventional steels and nickel superalloys simply do not. Instead of choosing between a metal that bends and one that breaks, they are pushing into a regime where the alloy can absorb huge amounts of energy without either failure mode dominating.\n\nWhat makes this alloy so disruptive is the way its atoms rearrange under stress. Rather than letting cracks race through the lattice, the structure forces dislocations to interact and multiply, spreading damage out instead of letting it localize into a catastrophic flaw. In the work led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the team showed that this design strategy lets the alloy survive loads and temperatures that would cause many existing high performance metals to fail, a result detailed in their description of an [indestructible new alloy](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69878989/new-alloy-is-defying-the-limits-of-metal/#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20researchers%20from,will%20break%20instead%20of%20bend.) that challenges the usual bend‑versus‑break tradeoff.\n\n# The rise of CrCoNi, the toughest metal on Earth\n\nRunning in parallel with the refractory work is a different family of materials that has quietly claimed the title of toughest metal on Earth. A simple blend of chromium, cobalt, and nickel, known as CrCoNi, has shown extraordinary resistance to crack growth, especially at cryogenic temperatures where most metals become glassy and fragile. In tests near liquid helium conditions, around 20 °K or -424 °F, this alloy did not just hold together, it absorbed more energy before fracturing than almost any other known material, which is why some researchers now describe CrCoNi as the toughest metal on Earth.\n\nThe secret again lies in how the crystal lattice responds when a crack tries to advance. Instead of a clean break, the CrCoNi structure spawns a cascade of deformation mechanisms, from twinning to phase transformations, each one soaking up energy that would otherwise drive the fracture. Detailed measurements of this behavior, including the remarkable toughness at -424 °F, are laid out in work identifying [CrCoNi as the strongest metal on Earth](https://www.technologynetworks.com/analysis/news/metal-alloy-identified-as-the-toughest-material-on-earth-370307#:~:text=CrCoNi%20%E2%80%93%20the%20strongest%20metal%20on,just%20grains%2C%E2%80%9D%20Richie%20said.), and they suggest obvious uses in liquefied gas infrastructure, deep space hardware, and any system that must stay ductile in extreme cold.\n\n# High‑entropy alloys force a rethink of metal design\n\nCrCoNi is part of a broader class known as high‑entropy alloys, where several elements are mixed in near equal proportions instead of relying on a single dominant base metal. For decades, metallurgists assumed such complex mixtures would be unstable or weak, but the opposite is turning out to be true. By spreading different atoms across the lattice, high‑entropy alloys frustrate the motion of dislocations and create a rugged energy landscape inside the metal, which can translate into exceptional toughness, strength, and resistance to radiation damage.\n\nResearchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have argued that their latest measurements on these materials, including comparisons between multi‑component systems and the simpler CrCoNi alloy, are strong enough to force the field to revisit long‑held assumptions about how metals should be formulated. Their findings on high‑entropy alloys, and how they stack up against [the simpler CrCoNi alloy](https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2022/12/08/say-hello-to-the-toughest-material-on-earth/#:~:text=The%20team's%20new%20findings%2C%20taken,as%20the%20simpler%20CrCoNi%20alloy.), point toward a future where designers treat composition space as a playground rather than a narrow corridor, searching for combinations that deliver multiple extreme properties at once instead of optimizing for just one.\n\n# Why this alloy barely melts, rusts, or breaks\n\nHeat is usually the enemy of metals, accelerating corrosion, softening the lattice, and eventually driving the material toward its melting point. That is why the claim that a new alloy can resist breaking, rusting, and even melting near 2,000 degrees Celsius is so striking. In work highlighted by Adrian Villellas, researchers focused on a chromium, molybdenum, and silicon blend that keeps its strength at temperatures where many steels would slump and oxidize aggressively, giving it a melting point near 2,000 C and a corrosion profile that looks more like a ceramic than a traditional metal.\n\nThe practical stakes are obvious in sectors like power generation, where Jet engines and gas turbines run hotter every year as engineers chase efficiency gains. If turbine blades and combustion liners can be built from a chromium‑molybdenum‑silicon alloy that does not readily rust, does not fracture under thermal cycling, and only approaches its melting point near 2,000 C, designers can push operating temperatures higher without sacrificing safety margins. Reporting on how [Villellas describes this chromium‑molybdenum‑silicon alloy](https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-create-a-metal-alloy-chromium-molybdenum-silicon-super-strength/#:~:text=ByAdrian%20Villellas,melting%20point%20near%202%2C000%20C.) underscores why turbine makers and heavy industry are watching these developments closely.\n\n# From unmeltable lab samples to real‑world heat shields\n\nAnother sign that the temperature ceiling for metals is moving comes from work at the Krua Institute of Technology in Germany, where scientists have demonstrated an alloy that effectively refuses to melt even when heated to 2,000 degrees Celsius. In a deep technical dive, researchers at the Krua Institute of Technology showed that by carefully balancing the phases present in the alloy and controlling grain boundaries, they could stabilize the structure against the usual pathways that lead to melting or catastrophic softening. The result is a metal that behaves more like a refractory ceramic in a furnace, yet retains the machinability and toughness that engineers expect from metallic systems.\n\nFor aerospace and spaceflight, that combination is particularly attractive. Heat shields, hypersonic leading edges, and reusable launch vehicle components all live in regimes where temperatures can spike toward 2,000 degrees Celsius, and current solutions often rely on brittle ceramics or complex thermal protection systems. If an alloy from the Krua Institute of Technology in Germany can survive those conditions without melting, it opens the door to simpler, more robust designs. The technical overview of this [unmeltable alloy from the Krua Institute of Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynSgN-BdoaQ) hints at applications ranging from atmospheric reentry hardware to industrial furnaces that run hotter and cleaner than today’s designs.\n\n# Wear‑proof metals and the Sandia surprise\n\nExtreme toughness and high melting points solve only part of the durability puzzle, because many components fail not by breaking but by slowly wearing away. That is where a different line of research, focused on wear resistance, has delivered its own near‑indestructible contender. At Sandia National Laboratories, a team working with a platinum‑gold composition discovered that their alloy was not just a little better than existing materials, it was dramatically more durable, surviving sliding contact and abrasion in tests that would quickly chew through high‑strength steel.\n\nFollow‑up analysis showed that this platinum‑gold alloy forms a lubricious surface layer under stress, effectively generating its own protective film as it wears. Measurements indicated that it is 100 times more durable than high‑strength steel, a staggering margin that immediately suggests uses in bearings, microelectromechanical systems, and any application where maintenance is difficult or impossible. Coverage of this work describes how a [platinum‑gold alloy at Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.labmanager.com/most-wear-resistant-metal-alloy-in-the-world-3704#:~:text=A%20platinum%2Dgold%20alloy%20developed%20by%20a%20team,100%20times%20more%20durable%20than%20high%2Dstrength%20steel) achieved that 100‑fold improvement, and why cost will be the main barrier to widespread adoption outside of niche, high value components.\n\n# Simulations, slick surprises, and the science of friction\n\nSandia’s work on wear resistance did not stop with precious metals. Engineers there also explored more practical alloys and surface treatments, and in the process they stumbled on what they described as a slick surprise. In one project, they found that a particular alloy system developed an ultra‑low friction carbon‑based layer during operation, turning an ordinary metal surface into something closer to a solid lubricant. That behavior, which emerged only after extensive testing, suggested that some alloys can be engineered to evolve protective films in situ, rather than relying on external oils or greases.\n\nTo understand and optimize these effects, researchers leaned heavily on modeling. In a separate effort, Sandia National Laboratories researchers Michael Chandross and Nic Argibay used detailed simulation work to visualize how atoms move and bonds break at sliding interfaces, helping them predict which compositions would form protective layers and which would simply grind away. Their description of this approach, including a [Caption highlighting Michael Chandross and Nic Argibay](https://newsreleases.sandia.gov/resistant_alloy/#:~:text=Caption,an%20author%20on%20the%20paper.), shows how virtual experiments can narrow the search space before any alloy is melted in the lab. The broader story of the slick surprise, and how it might even be used to mass‑produce premium lubricant, is captured in reporting on [a wear‑resistant alloy that generated its own slick layer](https://www.sandia.gov/labnews/2018/08/30/alloy/#:~:text=A%20slick%20surprise,to%20mass%2Dproduce%20premium%20lubricant.), underscoring how tribology is becoming a design parameter, not an afterthought.\n\n# NASA’s GRX‑810 and the aerospace stress test\n\nAerospace has always been the proving ground for new metals, and the latest example is NASA’s GRX‑810, a superalloy tailored for the brutal environment inside jet engines and rocket turbines. GRX‑810 is designed to maintain strength at high temperatures while also resisting the tiny cracks and voids that grow under repeated thermal cycling, the kind of damage that can eventually cause catastrophic failure in turbine blades. By dispersing fine oxide particles throughout the metal, engineers created a microstructure that pins dislocations and slows the growth of microscopic flaws, extending the life of components that see thousands of takeoff and landing cycles.\n\nFor commercial aviation and future spaceplanes, that kind of durability translates directly into lower maintenance costs and higher safety margins. If turbine parts can run hotter and longer without needing replacement, airlines can burn less fuel and spend less time with aircraft on the ground. NASA has framed GRX‑810 as a platform technology that could find its way into everything from next‑generation airliners to deep space propulsion systems, a vision captured in reporting on how [NASA’s GRX‑810 is set to transform the future](https://www.earth.com/news/nasas-new-superalloy-metal-grx-810-revolutionize-aerospace/#:~:text=NASA's%20new%20super%2Dmetal%20'GRX%2D810'%20set%20to%20transform%20the%20future) of aerospace metals.\n\n# Copper, stronger than steel and ready for heat\n\nNot every breakthrough alloy is exotic or rare. Copper, one of the oldest metals in human history, has recently been pushed into new territory by researchers who managed to create a copper alloy that is stronger than steel and can withstand temperatures of 1500 F. For industries that rely on copper’s excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, such as power electronics and electric vehicle manufacturing, that combination of strength and heat tolerance is particularly compelling, because it promises components that can carry more current and run hotter without deforming.\n\nThe work, highlighted by Scientists including Ben T, shows how careful control of microstructure and secondary phases can turn a familiar metal into something that behaves very differently under load. By refining grains, introducing nanoscale precipitates, or tweaking the mix of alloying elements, the team produced a copper‑based material that holds its own against structural steels while still handling 1500 F service conditions. Coverage of how [Scientists like Ben T created this ultra‑tough copper alloy](https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-create-ultra-tough-copper-152801931.html#:~:text=expand%20in%202026-,Scientists%20create%20ultra%2Dtough%20copper%20alloy%20that%20is%20stronger%20than,Pennsylvania%2C%20said%20in%20a%20statement.) underscores that even well‑known metals can still surprise us when their internal architecture is redesigned.\n\n# From lab curiosity to industrial workhorse\n\nAll of these advances raise the same practical question: how quickly can near‑indestructible alloys move from lab benches into real machines. Cost is one obvious constraint, especially for compositions that rely on platinum, gold, or other precious elements, which is why the platinum‑gold wear‑resistant alloy is likely to remain a niche solution for the most demanding and high value parts. Manufacturing is another, since many of these materials require precise control over cooling rates, heat treatments, or additive manufacturing parameters to achieve their record‑setting properties, and scaling that control to mass production is nontrivial.\n\nYet the [trajectory](https://tech.yahoo.com/science/articles/indestructible-alloy-defying-limits-metal-150000698.html#:~:text=Here's%20what%20you'll%20learn,the%20crystal%20structure%2C%20reducing%20brittleness.) is clear. High‑entropy alloys like CrCoNi are already being considered for cryogenic storage tanks and quantum computing hardware, refractory systems from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Krua Institute of Technology in Germany are pointing toward hotter, more efficient turbines and hypersonic vehicles, and application‑specific solutions like GRX‑810 and the ultra‑tough copper alloy are lining up for aerospace and electrification. As more of these metals prove their worth in service, the definition of what a “normal” metal can handle will shift, and designers will start to assume that components can survive temperatures near 2,000 C, wear environments that once demanded constant lubrication, and stress cycles that would have shattered previous generations of alloys. The near‑indestructible label may be aspirational, but the performance gains behind it are already very real.\n\n[A good Read with Coffee... ](https://reddit.com/link/1q22fya/video/9rmpylw4iyag1/player)\n\n# Jan. 2nd, 2026~Pebble metals align with US critical needs\n\n[Pebble metals align with US critical needs - North of 60 Mining News](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2026/01/02/news/pebble-metals-align-with-us-critical-needs/9421.html)\n\n[Based on updated metal prices and documented resources, the Pebble deposit contains roughly $591 billion of four critical minerals – copper, molybdenum, silver, and rhenium. - \\(Pebble Limited Partnership\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ovf8koepiyag1.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cd4e269bf1bb66d999c38eef4c8692261b77b9e)\n\n# USGS list expansion highlights nearly $1 trillion of metals locked in Alaska deposit.\n\nAs the U.S. Geological Survey expands its critical minerals list to reflect rising supply risk and strategic demand, the Pebble deposit in Southwest Alaska stands out for the breadth of metals it contains that now fall within that category. Viewed through the lens of this updated list, the combination of gold and a suite of critical minerals quantifies the scale of what remains locked in a single undeveloped domestic resource – and what the U.S. stands to gain by bringing it into production.\n\nFirst identified in 1987, the Pebble deposit has been drilled, tested, and evaluated for nearly four decades, producing a detailed technical record that includes multiple economic assessments examining different mine configurations and operating timelines.\n\nThose studies have documented one of the largest concentrations of copper, gold, and associated metals in North America, with measured and indicated resources totaling 52.99 billion pounds of copper, 53.82 million ounces of gold, 2.78 billion lb molybdenum, 249.3 million oz silver, and 4.08 million lb rhenium; plus an inferred resource with an additional 22.66 billion lb copper, 28.11 million oz gold, 1.81 billion lb molybdenum, 121.7 million oz silver, and 2.26 million lb rhenium.\n\nBased on these resources, a preliminary economic assessment completed in 2023 outlined a 20-year mining operation processing 180,000 tons per day that would produce an average of 320 million lb copper, 368,000 oz gold, 15 million lb molybdenum, 1.8 million oz silver, and 10,000 kilograms of rhenium annually.\n\nAt the metal prices used in that assessment – $3.90/lb copper, $1,700/oz gold, $22.50/oz silver, $12.50/lb molybdenum, and $1,500/kg rhenium – the project would pay back the $6.77 billion required to build the mine and supporting infrastructure within approximately five years of operations and generate a further $2.3 billion in profit after costs and taxes over the balance of the mine life.\n\nToday, these metals are selling for prices much higher than the most optimistic outlook when the PEA was completed – $5.70/lb copper, $4,300/oz gold, $72/oz silver, $21.60/lb molybdenum, and $4,760/kg rhenium.\n\nAnd the mining scenario outlined in the PEA would only access a portion of the known resource, with expansion scenarios extending operations to roughly 90 to 100 years beyond the initial mine plan, positioning Pebble not as a single mine, but as a multi-generational store of national wealth and a foundational asset for America's long-term mineral supply strategy.\n\n# Trillion-dollar deposit\n\nUnder the 2023 mine plan evaluated in the PEA, using the metal price assumptions applied in that study, Pebble was projected to generate approximately $1.74 billion in royalties, fees, and taxes for the state of Alaska, about $490 million for the Lake and Peninsula Borough, and roughly $1.4 billion in federal tax revenue.\n\nUnder the longer-life expansion scenarios extending operations toward a century, those public revenues were projected to rise to roughly $22 billion for Alaska, $4 billion for local government, and about $19 billion for the federal treasury, reflecting the magnitude of the deposit's contribution at both state and national levels.\n\nSince then, rising metal prices and new critical mineral designations have reshaped the context for evaluating the deposit.\n\nIn its most recent update, the USGS expanded the federal critical minerals list to reflect updated assessments of supply risk and economic exposure, increasing the total number of designated minerals from 50 to 60 and adding several widely used industrial and energy transition metals.\n\nThese recent additions include copper, silver, and rhenium – all found in the Pebble deposit – marking a shift toward recognizing high-volume commodities whose supply disruptions would carry broad economic and strategic consequences.\n\nCollectively valued at approximately $591 billion based on 2025 prices for the contained resource from all categories, this valuation represents a nearly 50% increase from the estimated $393 billion valuation from 2023 metal prices.\n\nBased on contained metal and current pricing, copper accounts for the largest share of Pebble's critical mineral value, at an estimated $431 billion, followed by molybdenum at approximately $120 billion.\n\nSilver contributes another $27 billion, while rhenium – one of the rarest elements in commercial production – adds roughly $13 billion, reflecting its critical role in high-performance aerospace applications.\n\nWhen the gold also found at Pebble is added in , the total in-ground value rises to $904 billion – nearly a trillion dollars and a 64% increase from the $552 billion valuation at 2023 prices – reflecting both the surge in gold prices and the broader repricing of strategic metals amid tightening global supply and rising geopolitical risk.\n\n# Critical minerals, critical need\n\nThe scale of Pebble's metal endowment takes on additional weight when measured against current U.S. consumption patterns and import dependence, particularly for the metals now classified as critical.\n\nAccording to USGS data, apparent U.S. copper consumption runs at approximately 4 billion lb annually, with domestic mine production supplying about 2.4 billion lb and the balance coming from imports and scrap recovery.\n\nMeasured against those figures, Pebble's copper resources alone would represent roughly 19 years of total U.S. consumption at current rates, or about 31 years of domestic mine production.\n\nSilver shows a comparable imbalance, with U.S. mine production running at roughly 30 to 35 million oz per year, well below combined industrial, technological, and investment demand, leaving domestic supply supplemented by imports and recycling.\n\nAnd supply constraints are sharper for rhenium, with U.S. production measured in the low tens of thousands of kilograms annually and sourced almost entirely as a byproduct of copper-molybdenum processing, while molybdenum supply remains similarly concentrated in a limited number of large porphyry systems, leaving both metals vulnerable to disruption from trade restrictions, geopolitical shifts, or operational outages at individual facilities.\n\nThose vulnerabilities have moved to the center of federal policy under the current administration, which has prioritized onshoring of critical mineral supply chains, reducing reliance on foreign sources – particularly China – and expanding domestic production capacity for materials deemed essential to national security, energy infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing.\n\nThe expansion of the USGS critical minerals list to include copper, silver, and rhenium signals a broader recognition that strategic risk extends beyond niche materials like rare earths and encompasses high-volume commodities that underpin electrification, defense systems, and industrial output at scale, placing deposits like Pebble within the scope of efforts to secure long-term domestic supply.\n\n# Blocked from future development\n\nDespite Pebble's documented scale, favorable economics under past assessments, and alignment with federal critical mineral priorities, the mine project in Southwest Alaska has effectively been blocked from future development – an outcome that followed a decision in January 2023 by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1cwkql0jyag1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd25fe0b26aac793734f5ff85aa533ab7e2e9b12\n\nThat decision took the form of a final determination under Clean Water Act Section 404(c), which prohibited mine development across 309 square miles of the Bristol Bay watershed where the world-class critical minerals-gold project is located and barred permitting for the project based on the agency's conclusion that such development posed unacceptable risk to aquatic resources and salmon habitat.\n\nThe action has been challenged by Pebble Limited Partnership, the state of Alaska, and several Alaska Native village corporations with land and economic interests in the project area, which jointly petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe challengers argue that the EPA's action exceeded the agency's authority, infringed on Alaska's constitutional role in managing its natural resources, and violated commitments made to the state at the time of statehood by precluding development on lands selected in part for their mineral potential.\n\nUltimately, the project remains under continued litigation, leaving Pebble's future – and the question of whether nearly a trillion dollars in documented metal resources will contribute to U.S. supply security – unresolved until the outcome of federal court proceedings determines the scope of state authority over resource development on lands acquired specifically for their mineral value.\n\n# ***FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS &amp; CONCLUSIONS AS ALWAYS:\n\n# Given the Dec. 22nd 2025~Key Moments from NioCorp’s Elk Creek Town Hall Video... \"WE ARE THERE!...\"\n\n[Key Moments from NioCorp’s Elk Creek Town Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P8_aRsmEcA)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bomsccgciyag1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af0474f5c3c9ac162073776ec8cda831f7bcdba3\n\nGiven the recent coverage on **“near-indestructible” alloys** isn’t just another cool lab story — it’s a quiet admission that the **old limits of metallurgy are breaking down**. High-entropy alloys, refractory systems, oxide-dispersion-strengthened superalloys, and self-healing wear surfaces are all converging toward one goal: metals that don’t snap, creep, corrode, or wear out under extreme heat and stress. What’s notable is that this isn’t one miracle material, but a cluster of breakthroughs arriving at the same time, forcing aerospace, defense, energy, and EV designers to rethink what metals can realistically survive.\n\nWhat the article doesn’t spell out — but anyone in materials science knows — is that **Niobium, Titanium, and Scandium sit at the center of this shift**. Niobium is essential for high-temperature stability and creep resistance in superalloys and refractory systems. Titanium (and TiCl₄ as its upstream precursor) underpins lightweight, corrosion-resistant structures and advanced AM powders. Scandium, especially when used in Sc-Al alloys, is a force multiplier: improving strength, fatigue life, weldability, and additive manufacturability while arresting cracks that normally cause catastrophic failure. **These elements are not “nice to have” — they’re structural enablers!**\n\nThis is where companies like **NioCorp and now the newly formed NAMA become strategically relevant**, not just as miners or processors, but as part of the new materials supply chain that enables next-generation defense and aerospace hardware. As hypersonics, reusable thermal structures, advanced turbines, and fusion-adjacent systems move from prototypes to production, **secure domestic sources of Nb, Ti, TiCl₄, and Sc matter far more than headline alloy names**. You can’t deploy “near-indestructible” alloys at scale if the critical inputs are geopolitically fragile or unavailable.\n\nThe takeaway: the materials ceiling is rising fast, and the winners won’t just be the companies designing exotic alloys — they’ll be the ones controlling the **critical minerals that make those alloys possible**. As Sc-Al alloys, high-entropy systems, and ultra-high-temperature metals move out of the lab and into real platforms, demand for Niobium, Titanium, and Scandium looks less cyclical and more structural. That shift has real implications for upstream players positioned early in the supply chain.\n\nIMHO- This is why companies like **NioCorp, NAMA, and IBC potentially fit a future textbook Title III profile**. As NioCorp anchors upstream domestic niobium and scandium supply at Elk Creek. **NAMA** represents midstream processing, qualification, and alloy readiness. IBC sits downstream as a DFARS-aligned manufacturer capable of turning exotic alloys into real castings, AM feedstock, and flight-ready hardware. Title III doesn’t fund hype — it funds **continuity**, and these three together **potentially** form a closed-loop materials ecosystem.\n\nIMHO- This is why **EXIM, the DoD, and Tier-1 defense primes are in deep discussions right now**. They aren’t looking for another single-metal supplier — they need a **fully domestic, vertically integrated materials platform**.\n\n***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!\n\n**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it.

Russell Black (R-Wilton) is [proposing](https://legislature.maine.gov/backend/app/services/getDocument.aspx?doctype=test&amp;documentId=188971) a $50 million bond to replenish Maine’s conservation program and help purchase high-value agricultural land, critical wildlife habitat and public access points to Maine’s coast.\n\nWithout this bond, Maine will lose even more land to development, taking the state’s dwindling rural workforce of farmers along with it, Black wrote in legislative testimony.\n\n“As a farmer and a fiscal conservative, I believe we should only spend taxpayer dollars when it’s absolutely necessary and when it delivers real, lasting value — and protecting Maine’s farmland does just that,” Black said.\n\n**—** [**L.D. 836**](https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/836?legislature=132)**: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Upgrade Municipal Culverts at Stream Crossings**\n\nAnother bill — this time from Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) — would dedicate a $50 million bond to Maine municipalities looking to replace or expand their aging, undersized culverts that channel water under or around roads. \n\nCulverts can be an achilles heel for municipalities facing heavy rainstorms and floods. Roads blow out when they’re overwhelmed and undermined, stranding residents trying to evacuate. Improving culverts would both mitigate flood risks and help aquatic wildlife travel from stream to stream, Daughtry [wrote](https://legislature.maine.gov/backend/app/services/getDocument.aspx?doctype=test&amp;documentId=189842) in testimony.\n\n**—** [**L.D. 25:**](https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/25?legislature=132) **An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Fund Wastewater Treatment Facility Planning and Construction of Infrastructure Projects**\n\nAnother $50 million bond measure from Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Scarborough) is for municipal and quasi-municipal wastewater treatment plants to purchase equipment that would help reduce the amount of wastewater sludge or biosolids they produce.\n\nThis is the scum that gets filtered out during wastewater treatment and often contains forever chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Maine municipalities often truck that waste to landfills such as Juniper Ridge in Old Town for burial and disposal.\n\n“This will save landfill space, reduce the volume and weight of sludge when it is transported … and will make sludge easier to handle,” wrote Melanie Loyzim, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. \n\n**—** [**L.D. 1904**](https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/1904?legislature=132)**: An Act to Establish the Municipal Shoreline Protection Legal Fund**\n\nThis bill from Sen. Senator Tim Nangle (D-Windham) has a smaller price tag — a minimum of $100,000 — and would build on Nangle’s prior legislation to help municipalities hold developers responsible for damage to fragile shoreline habitat.\n\nThe fund would help municipalities pay for legal action against violators of shoreline zoning restrictions and would be reimbursed if the municipalities win in court.\n\n**Climate priorities**\n\n**—** [**L.D. 1870:**](https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/1870?legislature=132) **An Act to Establish a Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program to Impose Penalties on Climate Polluters**\n\nThis bill from lead sponsor Brenner would charge fossil fuel companies operating during a certain timespan and emitting a certain amount of greenhouse gases for some costs of Maine climate adaptation projects. It prompted more than 100 letters of testimony when it was introduced last May and has been carried over into the second half of the legislative session.\n\nOther Democratic-led states have introduced similar “climate superfund” bills — 11 total, [according to Grist](https://grist.org/accountability/climate-superfund-law-maryland-california-vermont-new-york-trump-lawsuits/) — but only New York and Vermont have been successful. They’ve been mired in legal challenges ever since.\n\n**Forest products industry relief**\n\n**—** [**L.D. 1313**](https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/1313?legislature=132)**: An Act to Promote Equity in the Forest Products Industry by Allowing Commercial Wood Haulers to Be Eligible for Certain Sales Tax Exemptions and Refunds**\n\nSpearheaded by Sen. Brad Farrin (R-Norridgewock), L.D. 1313 would provide relief for one link in the forest products industry’s broader supply chain: a sales tax refund or exemption on the purchase of logging equipment and vehicles, from semitrucks to the long-armed machines that cut and haul timber. It would result in an estimated [loss in tax revenue](https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/bills_132nd/fiscalnotes/FN131302.htm) to the state of $269,000 in fiscal year 2026-2027, with slightly increasing losses in the years after.\n\n“It’s on the special appropriations table, and, honestly, that one has such a painfully small fiscal note, it would be great if we could get that one to move,” Krysta West, executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council, told *The Maine Monitor*.\n\nMaine’s multi-billion dollar forest products industry [has been hit](https://themainemonitor.org/loggers-tariff-impact/) by inflation, falling market prices for certain timber products, tariffs on logging equipment and an overall decline in manufacturing. \n\n**—** [**L.D. 798:**](https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/798?legislature=132) **An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Fund Mass Timber Manufacturing**\n\nL.D. 798 proposes another $50 million bond that would boost the manufacturing side of Maine’s forest products sector. The bill from Rep. Samuel Lewis Zager (D-Portland) would finance the creation or retrofitting of manufacturing equipment that produces refined timber products such as wood paneling and construction materials.\n\n**‘Forever chemicals’ and drinking water**\n\n**—** [**L.D. 1696:**](https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/1696?legislature=132) **Resolve, to Study Maine’s Absolute Dominion and Beneficial Use Laws Relating to Water Rights**\n\nRecurring drought over the past five years has prompted concern about the health of Maine’s aquifers and underwater reserves, especially in relation to the impact of large-scale water extractors such as Poland Spring.\n\nLead sponsor Rep. Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) told attendees of a Maine Conservation Voters meeting last week that she hopes this bill will study how other states are regulating their water and create actionable policy proposals for Maine.\n\n“We need to really have an examination of what our legal framework is for water,” Gramlich said.\n\n**—** [**L.D. 1177:**](https://legislature.maine.gov/billtracker/#Paper/1177?legislature=132) **Resolve, to Study the Public Health and Environmental Risks from Synthetic Turf**\n\nA second study proposal from Gramlich directs the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to study the health impacts of synthetic or artificial turf on humans, with specific concern about their use of forever chemicals.\n\nThe bill needs $100,000 in funding. Gramlich said she was working with state officials to try to lower that price tag.\n\n[https://themainemonitor.org/environmental-legislation-to-watch-2026/](https://themainemonitor.org/environmental-legislation-to-watch-2026/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/1q20pvx/environmental_legislation_to_watch_in_2026/", "score": 18, "num_comments": 0}}

The new plans will be the first implemented since 2018 and guide Missouri’s transportation network through 2050.\n\nThough updates typically happen every five years with the exception of a short pause during the pandemic, updates to these plans are significant because they ensure Missouri meets guidelines for state and federal transportation grants. Equally important is their reflection of emerging trends and constantly changing transportation needs of residents who use the state’s highways, sidewalks and local public transit systems every day.\n\nBut Missouri residents today have less of a say in their everyday transportation needs, and that’s been reflected in recent state legislative action. When Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the state operating and capital improvement budget bills for fiscal year 2026, he reduced the state’s Transit Operating Investment from $11.7 million to $6.7 million.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, the Missouri Public Transit Association’s 32 member agencies collectively provided an average of 40.1 million rides per year, totaling some $1.4 billion in annual direct economic impact, according to a Saint Louis University analysis.\n\nBut since the statewide cuts this fiscal year, public transit agencies, especially rural ones, have felt the impact. OATS Transit, a rural transportation agency that serves 87 counties in Missouri, lost $900,000 in state funding in 2025. Since agencies use state transportation funding to match federal funding, that translates to a total loss of $1.8 million.\n\nJackson Hotaling is the director of policy and programs at Missourians for Responsible Transportation, a nonprofit organization that works with Missouri communities to promote local transportation options that are safe, affordable and accessible.\n\n“It’s pretty incredible what cuts can do,” Hotaling said. “Not only are you cutting from the state budget a certain amount of money from a state agency, but often there are much larger matches that they’re trying to use that state money to attain more federal funding. So you’re at an order of magnitude impacting any rural transit agency.”\n\nHotaling serves on the executive committee advising the Missouri Department of Transportation on updates to the Long-Range Transportation Plan. The committee has representatives of transportation industries including aviation, highways and trucking, and waterways. It includes Hotaling as a representative for pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure.\n\nMissouri is one of only four states nationwide without an active transportation plan — that is, one accounting for people using nonmotorized modes of transportation to get to home, school or work — included in its long-range plan. Hotaling advocates for that as Missouri recorded a record number of pedestrian fatalities, not including bicyclists, in 2025. The state has the nation’s seventh-largest highway system, with nearly 34,000 miles of highways, including more miles of state highways than Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska combined.\n\nHotaling said each of the state transportation department’s seven districts see road and bridge funding as fundamental to building a transportation system that moves both people and goods while generating revenue and jobs. Missouri’s ongoing Improve I-70 project received $2.8 billion from the state’s $5 billion general revenue surplus in fiscal year 2024. But as billions are made available for such massive interstate expansions, less wiggle room emerges for public transit systems or active transportation infrastructure.\n\nAs a result, Missourians unable to afford cars could have less opportunity for transportation access in the updated plan. Even those who rely on Missouri’s highways face the consequences. Anthony Conway, who founded the Columbia-based car donation program Cars 4 Missouri in the early 2000s, said in an October interview with Vox Magazine that “the only real solution to a transportation issue in any community is a personal vehicle.”\n\nIf the state government makes a change to transportation funding, local public transit systems consolidate, but organizations like Conway’s also get less grant money, putting more people in need of a way to get from point A to point B.\n\nThe Long-Range Transportation Plan’s public comment period opens Jan. 14 and runs through Feb. 13. But whether the plan in its final form can accurately reflect the broader needs of Missouri residents hinges on what transportation initiatives can be supplemented locally.", "url": "https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/state_news/in-2026-missouri-is-set-to-revise-its-transportation-roadmap-for-the-next-quarter-century/article_f87eb4ed-1e52-5d84-b5e2-61674e86dd3f.html#tncms-source=topstory", "score": 17, "num_comments": 8}}

Race\nThe following are the races currently available in the game: human, elf, pixie, orc, Inuit, yokai, robot, mermaid, dragon, deity, succubus, demon, vampire, elemental spirit, titan, ghost, robot, fox, ?.\nHumans: A very widespread race that seems to be able to produce hybrids with many races (e.g. Red Hood Elvira, Pirate Rachel, Kunoichi Sumire)\n\nFairy: Basically in line with the image of popular acg works.\n\nPixie: Artificial race, possessing innate skills, with a defect of magical poisoning that occurs once every five hundred years, the original pixie came from the entertainment facilities of the old civilization.\n\nOrcs: A general term for different types of orcs, which can switch between human and animal forms, possess high combat skills, and there are a few cases of Inuit disguising themselves as wolf orcs.\nInuit: Generally have wolf ears and wolf tails in appearance, have common ancestors with the snowman, and both races are cursed by the Ice Dragon King. There are serious prejudices and even incidents of murder between the two races.\n\nMonster: In essence, it is a supernatural life form, naturally resistant to magic, and half-monsters are generally discriminated against.\n\nRobots: Robots that are born with autonomous consciousness the day after tomorrow, mainly living in the Neio Federation and the Floating City.\n\nMermaid: An aquatic race that can use special magic to land, mainly living in the kingdom of Atlantis.\n\nDragon: Tethys native intelligent life, with a long lifespan, powerful strength and amazing vitality, the original ancient dragon once participated in the battle between the guide and the seeker, and currently the dragon mainly belongs to three categories (fire dragon, land dragon, ocean dragon).\n\nGods: Essentially, they are auxiliary AIs left behind by the old human civilization. In the long time after the old human civilization perished, these AIs were born with consciousness. The essence of AIs makes them have the power to transcend time and space. However, after the destruction of the World Tree, the power of the gods in the heavens has greatly declined.\nMaidens: mainly live in the dungeon kingdom, provide people with dream therapy to generate revenue, and at the same time rely on dream therapy to absorb part of the life essence to sustain themselves, of course, there are also cases like Yuze.\n\nDemons: living in the demon world, they were originally always shrouded in the shadow of the bloody rule of the demons. Moreover, the bloodline of the four demons was widely distributed in the body of the demons, and the demons could be revived by suitable demons, which led to two unified wars, and the problem of local governments having too much power and threatening the central government was always faced.\n\nVampires: mainly live in the southern demon county of the demon world, once established an independent kingdom, can suck up artificial blood to sustain life, some vampire nobles have special magic inheritance rituals.\nElemental Spirits: Different elemental spirits have different settlements, such as water spirits mainly living in Atlantis.\n\nTitans: short in stature, Engineer Marianne is only 132, Titans widely use engineering machinery, with rich technical accumulation.\nGhost: Essentially, it is a kind of spiritual life.\n\nRobot: Humans with highly mechanized bodies need to undergo transformation by someone with a firm enough will, otherwise, they will turn into killing machines.\n\nFox: At present, the fox race characters that can be obtained are fox spirits, and more information is unknown\n\n?: The specific race of the character is unknown, and it usually involves important settings in the game's plot.\n\nII. Props\nThe Sword of Champions: Conceptual weapon, unknown material, can exert four special effects on magic, can release huge energy, exists without time and space restrictions, there will only be one Sword of Champions at any time and place. The power of the champion's sword needs to meet certain conditions, which the Canterbury royal family has thoroughly studied, and the conditions have been broken by the invaders' civilization.\n\nSoul Crystal: Made by absorbing multiple souls, it has extremely high utilization value. Soul Crystal is widely used in industrial production by invading civilizations.\n\nMagic Particle: The essence of magic, first recorded in the orbital elevator, has an unimaginable upper limit, produced by the combination of laboose bacteria and organic matter.\n\nlaboose: A special bacterium that can decompose all organic matter, can produce magic particles, and is an important part of the cycle of annihilation.\n\nFox Spirit Jade: The fox spirit is condensed from the fox spirit after a long period of cultivation, and it has the power to transcend the law of causality, which is also an important component of the fox spirit's power.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/fd8qp715txag1.jpeg", "score": 27, "num_comments": 0}}

A Lunch and Learn.", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/3CPG_PetroleumGeology/comments/1q1ni83/discussion_on_what_is_an_oil_and_gas_industry/", "subreddit": "3CPG_PetroleumGeology", "created_utc": 1767323532.0, "selftext": "In oil &amp; gas, a **Farm-Out** is when an owner (farmor) transfers part of their lease interest to another party (farmee) for them to conduct exploration/development work (like drilling), earning their share; the **Farm-In** is the farmee's act of earning that interest by fulfilling the work; a **Joint Venture** is a broader, separate legal entity for shared projects; and **Farm-Down** is when an existing owner reduces their stake, often by selling or farming out a portion to another partner. \n\nFarmout, in the context of the oil and gas industry, is a contractual arrangement between two parties - the 'farmor' and the 'farmee.' The 'farmor' is the party that owns the mineral rights and the associated leasehold interest in ***an oil and gas property***. The 'farmee,' on the other hand, is the entity that seeks to acquire a portion of those rights and interests to explore and potentially develop the reserves. This arrangement typically involves the transfer of a working interest, allowing the farmee to drill, produce, and develop the hydrocarbon resources.\n\n**Definitions**\n\n**Farm-Out:** A formal agreement where the leaseholder (farmor) grants another company (farmee) rights to a portion of their acreage in exchange for the farmee carrying out specific exploration or drilling obligations (e.g., drilling a well).\n\n**Farm-In:** The act of the farmee acquiring an interest in the lease by fulfilling the work obligations specified in the farm-out agreement, effectively earning their share.\n\n**Joint Venture (JV)**: A formal business arrangement where two or more companies form a new, separate entity or pool resources for a specific project, sharing ownership, risks, and profits, distinct from simply earning into a lease.\n\n**Farm-Down:** A common term for when a company reduces its working interest in a project, often by assigning (farming out) a portion of its share to a new partner to bring in capital or share costs, effectively \"farming down\" their original stake. \n\n**Key Relationship**\n\nA farm-out enables a farm-in. The farm-out is the offer, and the farm-in is the earning of the interest by the other party. \n\n**Why They're Used**\n\n**Risk Management:** Spreads the high financial and technical risks of exploration.\n\n**Capital Efficiency:** Brings in cash or technical expertise to develop assets.\n\n**Portfolio Management:** Allows companies to manage their asset base and enter new areas. \n\n&gt;\\[OP NOTE: The items above do not generate financing outside of or separate from the intended business agreements.

The most common types of contracts used are farm-outs-farm-ins, or well trade agreements, and joint operating agreements.\n\n**Farm-outs and farm-ins (Well trades)**\n\nWhen the owner (farmor) of an oil and gas working interest agrees to assign an interest in a lease (called the farm-out area) to another party (farmee) in consideration of the farmee drilling a well or wells (farm-out wells) on the farm-out area, the farmor is said to have made a farm-out and the farmee has made a farm-in. Sometimes the farmee may be required to do more than drill a well, including performing geological and seismic studies or paying a cash consideration for past costs incurred by the farmor.\n\nThese farm-out agreements are usually accomplished in a nonrecordable form of letter agreement that typically contains provisions relating to the following:\n\n* Names of the parties and the effective date of the agreement\n* Description of the leases and lands to be farmed-out\n* The location, well objective depth, commencement date, and geological requirements of the farm-out wells\n* Substitute or lost hole well provisions in the event the initial farm-out wells are lost because of drilling problems\n* Earning requirements of the various possibilities, such as a dry hole, a producer, a producer at any depth, more than one well, continuous drilling, and so on\n* Rights retained by the farmor, including working interest, overriding royalty, net profits, or combinations of these interests\n* Tender of wells or leases before abandonment and/or surrender\n* Negotiation and setting out of the terms of the joint operating agreement if the farmor retains a right to a working interest\n* Obligations for rental and/or royalty payments in the event of production\n* Liabilities of the parties and insurance provisions\n* Obligations to tender interests to the farmor if the farmee obtains extensions or renewals of farm-out leases\n* General clauses related to notices and information furnished to the parties, audits, marketing of production, access to the wells, and gas processing\n\nThe marketing of farm-outs and their negotiation and preparation require many skills. The terms of a farm-out deal vary with the market conditions of the times. Promotion is an art in itself. It involves allowing the farmor to receive more than what costs would have been if 100% of risks associated with the farmor's eventual interest after farm-out had been paid for by the farmor.\n\nDuring recent years, the term \"third for a quarter\" has been the basis for promotion of many farm-out deals. In these deals, the farmor attempts to recover all or as much of its past costs as the market will bear, along with the costs of the drilling of a well (to casing point, to dry hole, or through production facilities), reserving for the farmor as a back-in a percentage of the working interest (25% in \"third for a quarter\" deals) after the farmee has recovered the costs of the promotion (called after payout). For example, if a farmor owned 100% of the farm-out area and had land, geological and seismic studies, and estimated dry hole farm-out well costs of $300,000, the farmee, using a ratio of 3 to 4, would pay 100% of those costs for a 75% interest. A arty paying 1/3 of the costs on the same promoted basis would pay $100,000 for a 25% working interest.\n\n**Joint operating agreements**\n\nAnytime two or more owners of working interests decide to share the risk of drilling, development, or operations related to the production of oil and gas, they enter into what the industry calls a joint operating agreement (JOA) or, simply, an operating agreement. The JOA generally provides for one of the parties to act as the operator for the parties on the joint area covered by the JOA. It also specifies the operation for which the JOA was formed (the drilling of a well) and how costs and revenues will be shared, determined, and accounted for. In addition, it provides for each party's rights to the production obtained and sets out how leases will be acquired, maintained, transferred, and disposed.\n\nMost JOAs are predicated on the basis that the operator will not profit from its management of the joint interests. Except in an emergency, it must obtain authorization from the other parties (the nonoperators) to spend money for the joint account. Also, except in certain limited circumstances, no party may prevent another party from proceeding with operations that it desires to undertake at its own cost, risk, and expense. In these cases, if less than all the parties to the JOA proceed with a project on their own and in the event production is obtained from these sole expense or sole account operations, the consenting parties who took the risk for the project are allowed to recover from the nonconsenting party's share of production 100% of the costs incurred on behalf of the nonconsenting party plus a substantial additional percentage, usually several hundred percentage points depending upon the risks of the project. The percentage is higher for exploratory wells than for development wells.\n\n**Additional subjects covered by a JOA include the following:**\n\n1. Handling of title examination and the effect of loss or failure of title upon a party's interest\n2. Designation, resignation, and removal of an operator\n3. An operator's rights, duties, and liabilities\n4. Providing for the initial project, usually a test well's objective depth, commencement date, location, and abandonment procedures\n5. Expenditures and liabilities of the parties, including liens and payment defaults; payment and accounting requirements; limitations on expenditures to drill, deepen, rework, and plug back; and other operations\n6. Handling of rentals, shut-in payments, and minimum royalties\n7. Taxes\n8. Insurance\n9. Internal Revenue Service elections\n10. Claims and law suits against the parties\n11. Term of the JOA\n12. Acquisition, maintenance, or transfer of interests\n13. Other provisions, such as notices, force majeure, designation of areas of mutual interest, taking of production, gas balancing, preferential rights to purchase interests offered for sale by any party to the JOA, and compliance with laws and regulations\n\nOne of the more important parts of a JOA is the accounting schedule, which usually appears as an exhibit to and becomes a part of the JOA. This exhibit consists of five or six pages of fine print in a form developed by the Council of Petroleum Accountants Society, hence, it is called the COPAS form. The form, which is revised periodically, spells out the specific accounting methods that the operator must use to account for expenses and revenues.\n\nOnshore JOAs used today stem from work done by the American Association of Petroleum Landmen (AAPL) to create a standard form to simplify and facilitate the negotiation of JOAs with equitable results for all the parties concerned. Revision of AAPL Form 610 was last accomplished in 1989. Offshore JOAs in present use vary from party to party, but are similar in format to the onshore JOA. The American Petroleum Institute, who first created a model form Offshore Operating Agreement in December 1984, is presently attempting to standardize the offshore JOA.\n\nThe principal differences between the onshore and offshore agreements are in the areas related to penalties (which are higher offshore than onshore because of the cost and risk) for nonconsent operations and to the number of decision points for consent or nonconsent on future high cost operations. In addition, many nomenclature changes are needed to reflect the different operational activities occasioned by an ocean environment. Also, because of intense federal and state regulation, other factors complicate the offshore agreements, such as environmental control, compliance with federally mandated nondiscriminatory practices, and the different provisions needed to handle potential catastrophes affecting insurance and liability protection.\n\n# Other agreements\n\nThere are a variety of other special agreements used in oil and gas exploration and development activities.\n\n# Well support agreements\n\nThe three types of well support agreements are dry hole contribution, bottom hole contribution, and acreage contribution.\n\n1. A *dry hole contribution* is used by drilling parties to obtain money contributions from parties whose working interest leases located near the well to be supported will benefit from the drilling results. Dry hole contributions are paid (usually an agreed upon amount based on footage drilled) only in the event that the drilling results in a dry hole drilled to the depth specified. The party paying the contribution is entitled to all of the well data.\n2. A *bottom hole contribution* is similar to a dry hole contribution except that the agreed upon money contribution is paid whether the well is completed as a producer or abandoned as a dry hole.\n3. An *acreage contribution* is similar to a dry or bottom hole contribution except that the nondrilling party agrees to contribute all or part of the leases located near the support well rather than money.\n\n# Joint exploration and development agreements\n\nThese agreements or ventures arise from situations in which two or more parties pool their divided or undivided interests to share the costs and risks of either exploration or development or both. Typically, geological, seismic, and/or petroleum engineering studies, surveys, or evaluations are requisites to the agreements. Also, the typical venture involves large areas of mutual interest involving potential future lease acquisitions. Some of the participants may pay a disproportionate share of the costs of the venture for a chance to participate. These transactions may be very complex.\n\n# Bidding agreements\n\nBidding agreements commonly involve frontier or offshore areas where unleased public sector oil and gas interests will possibly become desirable to a group of companies who may wish to share the high bid costs and bid as a group. The group may have been formed as a result of joint exploration and/or development activities, or it may simply be a case of where a financial party desires to bid with a more knowledgeable industry partner or venturer. These agreements may be extremely complex as to methodology in determining what to bid, with whom, and at what time, as well as in the preparation process for a competitive lease sale. The formulas for participation after a sale may also be complex. Federal and state antitrust laws and other laws pertaining to penalties for collusion further cmplicate the processes.\n\n# Purchase or acquisition agreements\n\nPurchase agreements arise when two or more parties agree to share in the future purchase of either exploratory or producing oil and gas interests. These agreements usually spell out the subject matter to be considered for purchase; the interests of the parties; how prepurchase and after purchase costs, if different, will be borne; how revenues will be shared if one or more of the parties is entitled to a disproportionate share; and all of the operating provisions to be invoked upon purchase of the interests.\n\n# Seismic option agreements\n\nSeismic option agreements result from a party obtaining the right to purchase oil and gas interests, conditioned upon the results of a new seismic survey and/or evaluation of existing seismic. Sometimes a cash consideration must be paid for the option.\n\n# Lease exchange agreements\n\nLease exchange agreements involve situations in which two or more parties exchange rights and interests in an oil and gas lease in one geographic area for rights and interests in another area.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**AS EXAMPLE 1.** Company \"B\" enters into a 50/50 Joint Venture with company \"A.\" \n\n**Company \"A\"** has:\n\n150,000 acres of State Owned Minerals under an O&amp;G Term Lease for 10 years. Paid bonus of $25.00 per acre with annual rentals of $10 per acre. Five (5) years has elapsed. Time left to explore and develop to the point of the leases being retained by production in perpetuity is now five (5) years. \n\nHas 100% WI (Working Interest) (no other owners.) and has 100% of available NRI (Net Revenue Interest).\n\nThe the State receives 15.0% ORRI (Over Riding Royalty) means the state gets 15% of the revenue.\n\nCompany \"A\" now has 85% NRI (Net Revenue Interest) means they get 85% of the revenue.\n\n**Company \"B\"**\n\nAfter the Joint Venture is formed, company \"B\" and company \"A\" both get 50% of 85% NRI = 42.5% of the revenue. Company \"A\" has reduced their potential income by 50%. Both companies pay 50% of all the costs to drill and develop to obtain 50% of the revenues. \n\nAny other for of farm in, farmout for a 50/50 agreement is basically the same.\n\n**AS EXAMPLE 2.** A complete Farm Out. Company \"B\" farms out all the acreage belonging to company \"A\". The reason is company \"A\" does not have the ability to explore and develop the acreage before the O&amp;G Leases expire. Basically they transfer/assign the leases to company \"B\" subject to state approval and the terms of the farm out and performance. Company \"A\" retains a 5% ORRI and delivers to company \"B\" 100% WI and an 80% NRI\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nAs per all the above, there is no exact set format to conduct these type of O&amp;G business transactions. In the absence of a complete sale, no cash or financing is usually obtained. That would negate the reasons for a Farm-Out, a Farm-In, a Joint Venture, or a Farm-Down.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**RECENT Farm Out Activity on the North Slope of Alaska.**\n\n**Why Farm-Outs?**\n\n* **Cost Sharing:** North Slope projects, especially large-scale exploration and infrastructure, are capital-intensive, making farm-outs crucial for spreading financial risk.\n* **Expertise:** Smaller operators can gain technical expertise from larger partners, while majors can gain access to promising new areas. \n\n1.) In late 2024 and heading into 2025, farm-out activity on Alaska's North Slope focused on securing acreage near existing infrastructure, with 88 Energy acquiring new South Prudhoe leases and planning farm-outs for exploration wells, particularly targeting the Ivishak formation.\n\n[HICKORY-1 well during flow test](https://preview.redd.it/ln40p45xruag1.jpg?width=289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=364c997759879d2959398ed6a9e08808e3be12d6)\n\n**EXAMPLE of a very successful North Slope Farm Out**\n\nSANTOS: 19th Sep 2023. Consistent with its Alaska strategy to focus on the Pikka development, Santos today announced it will farm-down half of its working interest in 148 exploration leases (more than 270 thousand acres of State of Alaska lands) on the Alaska North Slope in an agreement with APA Alaska LLC1 and Lagniappe Alaska LLC2.\n\n18th Mar 2025 Today, APA Corporation announced an oil discovery on Alaska’s North Slope from the Sockeye-2 exploration well in the Lagniappe area east of Prudhoe Bay. Santos holds a 25 per cent stake in the joint venture with APA Corporation (50 per cent) and Lagniappe Alaska, LLC (25 per cent). The exploration well cost is carried by APA as part of a 2023 farm-in agreement.\n\nThe Sockeye-2 well was drilled to a depth of approximately 10,500 feet, successfully reaching a high-quality reservoir containing around 25 feet of net oil pay within a single, blocky, Paleocene-aged sand formation with an average porosity of 20 per cent.  Additionally, potential pay zones were identified in the shallower Staines Tongue formation.\n\nAs previously announced, the Sockeye-2 well was successfully drilled to a depth of approximately 10,500 feet and encountered a high-quality Paleocene-aged clastic reservoir with an average porosity of 20%. The vertical Sockeye-2 well was completed in a single 25-foot interval at approximately 9,200 feet TVD \\[Dmax not an issue\\], **without stimulation. The well performed in line with expectations during the 12-day production test, averaging 2,700 barrels of oil per day during the final flow period,** without artificial lift. The results of the flow test indicate significantly higher reservoir quality compared to similar topset discoveries to the west. Further appraisal drilling will determine the ultimate size of the discovery, but the flow test demonstrates the exceptional productivity of this shallow-marine reservoir.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n# PERMIAN BASIN TEXAS, USA\n\nRecent oil and gas activity in the Permian Basin has been characterized primarily by **large-scale mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) and joint ventures for infrastructure, rather than traditional farm-out agreements**. Companies are focused on consolidating core acreage and expanding midstream capacity, with a notable recent transaction involving Crescent Energy's asset sale. \n\n**Notable Recent Transactions (2025-2026)**\n\nThe primary trend in the Permian has been large companies (majors and super-independents) buying smaller producers to gain multi-decade drilling inventory. \n\n* **Crescent Energy Asset Sale:** In April 2025, Crescent Energy completed the sale of its non-operated Permian Basin assets in Reeves County, Texas, to a private buyer for **$83 million in cash**. The assets had projected 2025 production of approximately 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n* **Texas Pacific Land Acquisition:** In October 2024, Texas Pacific Land Corporation acquired Permian oil and gas mineral and royalty interests for **$286 million** to expand its position, with much of the acreage operated by ExxonMobil and Diamondback Energy.\n* **Midstream Joint Ventures and Acquisitions:** There has been significant activity in natural gas infrastructure.\n   * In August 2025, a joint venture between ONEOK, WhiteWater, MPLX, and Enbridge was announced for the **Eiger Express Pipeline**, a new natural gas pipeline to transport gas from the Permian to the Gulf Coast.\n   * In late 2025, midstream companies like MPLX and Targa Resources made major acquisitions to secure gas gathering and processing capabilities in the basin to meet growing demand from LNG exports and AI data centers. \n\n**General Industry Context**\n\n* **Shift from M&amp;A to Integration:** After a record-setting $100 billion-plus in M&amp;A deals in 2023, the pace of large transactions slowed in late 2024 and 2025 as companies focused on integrating their newly acquired assets.\n* **Focus on Core Assets:** The market is highly competitive, and the majority of top-tier (Tier 1) acreage has already been consolidated by major players, making it difficult for smaller private operators to enter the core area.\n* **\"Farm-out\" Agreements Less Common:** While general asset transactions and M&amp;A are frequent, traditional \"farm-out\" agreements (where a lease owner grants drilling rights to another company in exchange for a portion of production or other consideration) have not been the dominant form of major news in the basin recently, largely overshadowed by outright purchases and large infrastructure partnerships. \n\n[Multiple Horizontal Pad Drilling Permian Basin](https://preview.redd.it/q5lmi1vcjuag1.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=810b44152b82048549e1c4dee8aa4e9ead0d46e4)\n\nARTICLE \"\n\n[GRAPH](https://preview.redd.it/r01p3refmuag1.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f0448f8b2049bedd05bc9b7307994cd656752c3)\n\n[LISTING DIFFERENCES](https://preview.redd.it/yhhjkocnnuag1.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1029c61637c41f9b846015deb1a1bbd50b8db51e)\n\n\\-ends-", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/3CPG_PetroleumGeology/comments/1q1ni83/discussion_on_what_is_an_oil_and_gas_industry/", "score": 6, "num_comments": 2}}
{"keyword": "Doña Ana County industrial revenue bonds", "item": {"title": "Can We (Still) Trust Economic Data?", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/1q1fles/can_we_still_trust_economic_data/", "subreddit": "WayOfTheBern", "created_utc": 1767302777.0, "selftext": "From Kimi K2\n\n-------\n\n# **The Vibe Session: When Statistics Lie and Reality Bites** (00:00-05:00)\n\nThe video opens with a devastating critique of modern economic statistics, introducing the concept of \"vibe session\" - the growing disconnect between official economic indicators and lived reality. The host argues that when metrics become political goals rather than measurement tools, they cease to reflect reality. Elections are won and lost on unemployment numbers, creating irresistible pressure to massage definitions until they produce favorable outcomes. Banks hide bad loans to prevent systemic panic, CEOs manipulate stock prices for personal gain, and the entire statistical edifice becomes a theater of illusion rather than a window into truth. This isn't conspiracy theory but institutional analysis - the very structure of how we measure economic health creates incentives for deception that rational actors cannot resist.\n\nThe psychological dimension receives equal attention. The host acknowledges his own complicity in the doom industrial complex, noting how negative content consistently outperforms positive stories despite genuine good news like effective tax policies targeting wealthy asset owners, crackdowns on price-fixing algorithms, and bans on non-compete agreements. This creates a feedback loop where media organizations, responding to market incentives, flood audiences with catastrophic narratives while ignoring substantive improvements. The result isn't just misinformation but a systematic distortion of risk perception that drives both political polarization and economic decision-making based on false premises about reality's actual trajectory.\n\n# **The Stock Market Mirage: Why Record Highs Signal Decline** (05:00-15:00)\n\nThe analysis of stock market dynamics represents the video's most subversive insight. While corporate media celebrates record highs, the host demonstrates how these gains actually represent economic failure for most Americans. Share ownership is so concentrated among the wealthy that stock market growth primarily benefits those already possessing significant assets, while simultaneously pricing ordinary people out of housing and other essential markets through asset inflation. The mathematical reality is brutal - when portfolios triple in value for the affluent, they can easily outbid workers whose wages have remained stagnant, creating a feedback loop where market success equals life deterioration for the majority.\n\nThe mechanism is elegantly explained through the concept of \"money piles\" - consumption, real estate, stocks, bonds, gold, and alternative assets. As wealth concentrates among those whose consumption needs are already saturated, excess capital flows into asset markets, driving prices beyond the reach of wage earners. The video reveals how housing becomes particularly toxic in this dynamic - measured against consumer prices, housing appears merely expensive, but measured against asset prices like gold or stocks, housing has actually become cheaper for asset owners while growing impossibly expensive for those whose income derives from labor. This isn't market failure but market success at concentrating wealth while masquerading as prosperity through rising asset values that most people cannot access.\n\n# **The Data Degradation Crisis: From Measurement to Mystification** (15:00-30:00)\n\nThe systematic breakdown of economic data collection receives forensic treatment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics now publishes reports based on as little as 55% of eventual data, using \"imputed\" figures - polite terminology for sophisticated guesswork based on historical correlations that break down during periods of rapid change. Small businesses, which feel economic shocks first and respond fastest, increasingly refuse to participate in voluntary surveys, creating a systematic bias toward large enterprise experiences that lag broader economic reality. The result is official data that consistently misses turning points, only acknowledging recession after it's already devastating communities that the statistics claim are prospering.\n\nThe gig economy emerges as particularly devastating to data reliability. Traditional assumptions about business creation equaling job creation collapse when millions register as businesses to drive Uber or deliver food - activities that represent economic desperation rather than opportunity. The video documents how government agencies knowingly count gig worker registrations as entrepreneurial success while understanding these \"businesses\" create no jobs, invest no capital, and represent people failed by traditional employment rather than thriving innovators. This isn't bureaucratic incompetence but intentional obfuscation - politicians benefit from headlines about record business formation while avoiding accountability for an economy where full-time employment with benefits becomes increasingly rare.\n\n# **The Inequality Engine: How Statistics Hide Reality** (30:00-45:00)\n\nThe connection to \"The Spirit Level\" becomes explicit as the video demonstrates how inequality doesn't just distort economic outcomes but fundamentally corrupts the information systems meant to track them. Wealthy areas with high labor force participation mask collapse in regions left behind, creating national averages that suggest stability while entire communities disintegrate. West Virginia's 35% participation gap between counties represents not local anomaly but intensified version of national trends where concentrated prosperity in tech/finance hubs obscures widespread abandonment of traditional employment.\n\nThe psychological impact receives equal attention. The host documents how inequality creates systematic measurement bias - business owners supporting current administrations become more likely to respond to surveys with positive information while suppressing negative data, creating political cycles in economic statistics. More fundamentally, as inequality increases, the wealthy become less likely to participate in surveys at all, viewing government data collection as irrelevant to their lives while the desperate flood responses with optimistic misrepresentations hoping to influence policy. The result isn't just inaccurate data but systematically biased information that reinforces political narratives regardless of ground truth.\n\n# **The Trust Collapse: When Numbers Become Meaningless** (45:00-60:00)\n\nThe erosion of trust in official statistics represents perhaps the most corrosive long-term impact. The video documents how alternative data has become a $15.4 billion industry as investment firms pay for satellite imagery, private surveys, and proprietary information to gain advantages over ordinary investors relying on public data. This creates a two-tier information system where the wealthy access accurate information while the public receives politicized distortions. The democratic implications are devastating - policy debates occur using different factual baselines depending on socioeconomic position, making consensus impossible when parties cannot agree on reality's basic contours.\n\nThe behavioral economics analysis reveals how this corruption creates self-fulfilling pessimism. When people recognize that official data contradicts their lived experience, they become less likely to invest in skills, start businesses, or make long-term commitments that might improve their situations. This \"vibe session\" becomes economically real as lowered expectations reduce consumer confidence, business investment, and labor market participation regardless of actual underlying conditions. The video connects this to declining social trust more broadly - when statistical authorities lose credibility, the foundation for collective action and democratic decision-making erodes, creating political paralysis precisely when urgent problems require coordinated response.\n\n# **The Asset Economy: How Markets Became Extractive** (60:00-75:00)\n\nThe transformation from productive to extractive capitalism receives systematic treatment. Stock buybacks totaling over $1 trillion annually while net household stock purchases reach only $100 billion reveals companies primarily enriching shareholders rather than investing in growth. This represents not market efficiency but systematic extraction where corporate profits flow to asset owners rather than productive investment. The mathematical certainty is brutal - when companies buy six times more of their own stock than households purchase, asset prices must rise regardless of underlying economic health, creating wealth for owners while producing nothing for non-owners.\n\nThe housing analysis demonstrates how this dynamic makes asset ownership increasingly impossible for non-owners. As asset prices rise faster than wages, the barrier to entry grows exponentially. The video's gold-price comparison reveals housing hasn't become more valuable in absolute terms - it's become more expensive relative to labor income while cheaper relative to asset income. This represents not market failure but market success at concentrating wealth, where the same economic forces making asset owners richer make non-owners poorer through rent extraction and price inflation in essential goods.\n\n# **The Measurement Crisis: From Jousting to Jet Engines** (75:00-90:00)\n\nThe video's most profound insight connects measurement failure to institutional collapse. The host argues we're monitoring economic indicators designed for industrial economies while living in a digital/gig economy that makes traditional metrics meaningless. Unemployment statistics designed for full-time manufacturing jobs cannot capture underemployment in service sectors. GDP measurements created for goods-producing economies fail to capture value creation in digital services. Inflation indices designed for stable consumption baskets cannot account for rapid quality changes and substitution effects in technology markets.\n\nThe political economy of this failure reveals intentional blindness. Agencies receive 10% fewer staff and 15% lower budgets than 2010 while their scope has expanded dramatically, forcing reliance on imputed data that serves political rather than analytical purposes. The Bloomberg terminal example - where financial firms pay $30,000 annually for accurate data while public agencies starve - demonstrates how measurement quality has become class-based. The wealthy purchase truth while the public receives propaganda, making democratic accountability impossible when citizens cannot access accurate information about their government's performance.\n\n# **The Future of Failure: What Happens When Statistics Die** (90:00-105:00)\n\nThe conclusion offers not policy prescriptions but existential warning. The video argues we're approaching a tipping point where institutional legitimacy collapses entirely as measurement systems become obviously fraudulent. Ten million working-age men outside labor force statistics, entire regions with 42% participation rates, systematic under-reporting of economic distress through gig economy misclassification - these represent not statistical errors but systematic exclusion of unpleasant reality from official discourse.\n\nThe democratic implications are terminal. When citizens recognize that economic reporting systematically misrepresents their experience, the foundation for evidence-based policy disappears. Politics becomes purely performative as different factions operate using different factual universes. The video suggests we're witnessing not just measurement failure but the collapse of shared reality necessary for democratic governance. In this environment, economic decisions become purely tribal - supporters of current administrations believe official data while opponents trust alternative sources, making consensus impossible and policy formation purely ideological rather than analytical.\n\nThe final message is chilling: the corruption of economic statistics represents not bureaucratic failure but successful capture of information systems by interests they supposedly monitor. Like jousting tournaments continuing after the invention of gunpowder, our economic measurements persist not because they're useful but because they serve entrenched interests who benefit from obscuring reality. Until this fundamental corruption is addressed, policy debates will remain theater while actual economic conditions continue deteriorating for most citizens, regardless of what official numbers claim.\n\n-----\n\nAlso, if you have not read the Spirit Level, here is a breakdown\n\n-----\n\n# **The Spirit Level: Why Inequality Makes Everyone Miserable (Even the Rich)**\n\nFor Redditors who haven't encountered this groundbreaking work, *The Spirit Level* by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett is essentially the **scientific Bible of why inequality is poison** - and its 15-year anniversary update shows things have gotten catastrophically worse since 2009.\n\n## **The Core Discovery: Inequality is a Social Virus**\n\nThe book's central revelation is **devastating in its simplicity**: once countries reach a basic level of prosperity, **the size of the gap between rich and poor determines everything** - from murder rates to mental health, from obesity to imprisonment, from teenage pregnancies to how much we trust our neighbors. \n\n**This isn't about poverty** - it's about **relative deprivation**. The authors proved that middle-class people in unequal countries suffer worse health and social outcomes than poor people in equal countries. Inequality literally **infects the entire social body**, creating what they call \"status anxiety\" - the constant stress of worrying about your position in the hierarchy.\n\n## **The 2024 Update: \"The Spirit Level at 15\" Shows We're Fucked**\n\nThe anniversary report is **absolutely horrifying**:\n\n- **The richest 52 UK families now own more wealth than the bottom HALF of the population** (33 million people) \n- If trends continue, **by 2035 the richest 200 families will own more than the entire UK GDP** \n- **The richest 1% globally emit more carbon than the poorest 66% combined** \n- Billionaire wealth has **skyrocketed over 1000% since 1990** while \"the rest of humanity has been left behind\" \n\n## **Why This Connects to \"How Money Works Uncut\"**\n\nThe video's critique of **unreliable economic statistics** is *exactly* what The Spirit Level predicted would happen. As inequality explodes:\n\n### **1. Trust Collapses**\n- People stop believing government data because it contradicts their lived experience\n- **\"When a metric becomes a goal, it's no longer a useful metric\"** - unemployment definitions get massaged to protect politicians\n- High inequality countries have **dramatically lower trust** in institutions and fellow citizens \n\n### **2.

A Congressional Candidate Makes the Case", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UsaNewsLive/comments/1q1eui5/seize_pge_a_congressional_candidate_makes_the_case/", "subreddit": "UsaNewsLive", "created_utc": 1767300972.0, "selftext": "In progressive activism, few ideas capture the imagination quite like the concept of seizing control of essential services from private corporate hands and placing them under government oversight. And that’s just what a candidate for Congress suggests.\n\nSaikat Chakrabarti, a former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and now a congressional candidate for San Francisco, running to succeed Nancy Pelosi, recently took to Twitter/X to proclaim that the city could simply “use eminent domain to seize PG&amp;E’s infrastructure now and switch to public power.”\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\nHe insisted, “We don’t need new legislation to do this, all we need is political will.” FYI, he’s the acknowledged far-left congressional candidate, a socialist basically, running on Medicare for all, a transition to green energy and to stop funding the “genocide in Gaza.” He’s a deci-millionaire, making his fortune in Tech. Big surprise.\n\nHis claim San Francisco can seize PG&amp;E is not just misguided, it’s embarrassingly oversimplified, ignoring the principles of fiscal responsibility, property rights, and free-market enterprise. Chakrabarti’s warp-speed rhetoric smacks of the kind of hair-brained, utopian socialism that we have long warned against: big government solutions that sound empowering but inevitably lead to bloated bureaucracies, skyrocketing costs, and diminished service quality. And often, failure.\n\nChakrabarti’s proposal rests on a fundamental misunderstanding (or perhaps a deliberate glossing over) of what eminent domain truly entails. Eminent domain is not a magic wand for “seizing” private assets free of cost or consequence; it’s a constitutional power that demands fair compensation under the Fifth Amendment. Far from being a cost-free takeover, any attempt by San Francisco to acquire PG&amp;E’s electric energy distribution network would require the city to pay fair market value, a figure that easily balloons into the billions. Eminent domain isn’t confiscation; it’s a forced sale at a price determined through rigorous valuation, often contested in court. What he proposes is a dangerous expansion of government authority, where taxpayer dollars are funneled to prop up public monopolies at the expense of private innovation. PG&amp;E, despite its flaws, operates in a regulated energy market where competition and accountability drive improvements, something a city-run utility, insulated from market pressures, would lack.\n\nThe acquisition costs alone are staggering, underscoring the fiscal illiteracy embedded in Chakrabarti’s tweet.\n\nSan Francisco has already floated offers around $2.5 billion for PG&amp;E’s local assets, including wires, poles, substations, and meters serving roughly 472,000 customers. But PG&amp;E has rebuffed the offers as undervaluations, and independent assessments suggest the true cost could climb to nearly $3 billion or more, especially when factoring in severance damages for the impact on PG&amp;E’s broader operations. Billions may be required when including financing through revenue bonds, which would saddle local ratepayers with decades of debt service payments.\n\nThis isn’t mere pocket change; it’s a monumental financial commitment that diverts resources from core city priorities like public safety and infrastructure maintenance. Imagine the outrage if a private company proposed such an expenditure without clear returns, yet radical progressives like Chakrabarti pooh-pooh it away as mere “political will.” In reality, this would likely translate to higher utility bills or tax hikes, burdening working families in a city already grappling with exorbitant living costs.\n\nBeyond the upfront purchase price, the costs to integrate PG&amp;E’s operations are mind-boggling, revealing the naive optimism of Chakrabarti’s vision. Transitioning to a municipal-owned utility wouldn’t happen overnight; it would involve absorbing hundreds if not thousands of PG&amp;E employees, aligning pensions and benefits, and assuming liability for ongoing maintenance of an aging grid. PG&amp;E’s resistance has already generated over 130 legal filings in the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) process, initiated in 2021, with delays adding at least $35 million to the city’s tab since 2018. Litigation could drag on for years, as PG&amp;E contests valuations and argues that a breakup harms statewide reliability and wildfire mitigation efforts. Government entities are notoriously inefficient at such integrations, look no further than San Francisco’s own track record with projects like the Central Subway, which ballooned from $647 million to over $1.6 billion due to mismanagement.\n\nMoreover, ongoing operational costs would exacerbate the fiscal nightmare. Running a public utility means the city would shoulder billions in annual expenses for maintenance, upgrades, and emergency responses without the profit incentives that drive private efficiencies. PG&amp;E’s statewide operations cost billions yearly, and San Francisco’s dense urban grid, while potentially less expensive per capita than rural areas, still requires massive investments to address deferred maintenance and modernize systems like SCADA (an industrial control and monitoring system) and metering. Critics from labor unions like IBEW 1245 have warned that such a takeover “would hurt almost everyone and would improve nothing,” citing risks to jobs, service quality, and affordability. This epitomizes the pitfalls of public ownership: without market discipline, costs spiral as bureaucrats prioritize political agendas over operational excellence. Proponents claim long-term savings from eliminating PG&amp;E’s profit margins, but historical voter rejections of similar measures in 2008 highlight public skepticism over these “savings” materializing amid government bloat.\n\nChakrabarti’s oversimplification ignores these realities, framing the issue as a simple battle against “corporate greed” rather than a complex economic equation. True reform lies in bolstering private accountability through deregulation and competition, not expanding government control. PG&amp;E’s monopoly status is a product of overregulation, and breaking it via eminent domain would merely replace one monopoly with another: city hall’s. The recent blackouts in December 2025 have fueled calls for action, but rushing into a multi-billion-dollar gamble risks fiscal disaster. Progressives despise PG&amp;E for ideological reasons, viewing it as a symbol of capitalist excess, but we see the utility’s challenges as opportunities for market-driven fixes, not state seizures.\n\nPublic utilities elsewhere, while sometimes cheaper, often rely on subsidies that mask true costs, something San Francisco, with its budget deficits, can ill afford. Chakrabarti’s claim reduces this to “political will,” but we know that will without wisdom leads to waste.", "url": "https://californiaglobe.com/fr/seize-pge-a-congressional-candidate-makes-the-case/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0}}

Here’s What It Means for Your Table and Your Bottom Line.", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Restaurant101/comments/1q15p3q/minimum_wage_just_went_up_heres_what_it_means_for/", "subreddit": "Restaurant101", "created_utc": 1767278500.0, "selftext": "**Minimum Wage Just Went Up. Here’s What It Means for Your Table and Your Bottom Line.**\n\nToday, January 1, 2026, 8.3 million workers will see their paychecks tick up. 19 states and 49 cities and counties are raising their minimum wage. If you run a restaurant, cook, serve, or bartend, or if you eat out in Seattle, California, New York, or anywhere in between, this matters to you. It matters more than the headlines suggest.\n\n**The Story Is Complicated.**\n\nIn Washington State, the state minimum wage is raised to $17.13 per hour, making Washington the highest in the nation. Seattle has pushed to $21.30 per hour. That is a 54-cent raise from 2025. It’s the third consecutive year Seattle has made this adjustment, tied to the regional Consumer Price Index.\n\nArizona jumped to $15.15. California landed at $16.90 statewide. New York City and Long Island hit $17.00. Connecticut reached $16.94. Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Colorado all cross the $15 threshold. Missouri and Nebraska hit $15 for the first time. Today, more workers will be earning $15 or higher than workers stuck at the federal minimum of $7.25, a wage that hasn’t moved since 2009.\n\nThis isn’t abstract policy. For a line cook in Seattle, that $21.30 rate is real money. For a server in San Francisco, where the minimum wage has already been climbing, the January bump is a step toward survival in a city that costs what it costs. For the 8.3 million workers affected directly, the raises total $5 billion in new annual wages.\n\nYou wonder, “What will happen to my restaurant?” or “What will happen to my meal?”\n\n**The Operator’s Math**\n\nRestaurant margins are thin. A restaurant doing $1 million in annual sales might clear $50,000 in profit. That is 5%. Some years less. Labor costs sit around 30% of revenue in quick-service restaurants, higher in full-service establishments where you need servers, bartenders, and hosts. When labor costs climb, owners face three choices. Raise prices. Cut hours or staff. Absorb the cost and watch profit margins shrink.\n\nThe data from 2024 tells the story plainly. 89% of restaurant operators reported that labor costs rose, exceeding the 79% that expected the increase. Half of all operators raised menu prices in response to wage pressure. Some cut hours. Some eliminated positions. A few closed.\n\nIn Washington, over 2,000 restaurants shut their doors in the first six months of 2025. Not all closures were wage-related. Rent, food inflation, and consumer fatigue all played a role. Wage pressure was part of the math. In Seattle, Wooden City Tavern and Skillet locations closed recently, citing labor costs alongside other mounting expenses. The owners understood their margins. You can’t charge what the market won’t bear.\n\nSeattle’s Restaurant Alliance warned that without relief, a small operator faced a 20% increase in labor costs when total compensation protections expired at the end of 2024. Total compensation allowed small businesses to count reported tips and medical benefits toward minimum wage. January 1, 2025, stripped that away. Now, every dollar of the minimum wage must come from the employer’s pocket. Tips sit on top of wages, not underneath them.\n\nThis matters because it’s unambiguous. There is no gray area for an accountant to find. The law says what it says.\n\n**What Actually Happens To Menu Prices**\n\nHere’s what the research shows, and this is worth holding onto: restaurants raise prices, but the increases aren’t dramatic, and they don’t happen overnight.\n\nWhen Seattle raised its minimum wage in 2015, the earliest in the country to hit $15, observers predicted the sky would fall. A study in 2017 examined supermarket prices in Seattle and King County after that first minimum wage jump. The result was that there was no significant change in food prices one month or one year after the ordinance took effect. Menu prices edged up, but the effect was marginal.\n\nThat doesn’t mean prices never rise. They do. The timing is gradual. Research on restaurant pricing found that the effect of a minimum wage increase on prices takes more than a year to fully pass through to consumers.\n\nFast-food operators respond by raising prices 4% to 5% for every major wage hike. A burger that cost $8 becomes $8.32 to $8.40. Consumers notice the dollar amount more than the percentage. They pay it anyway.\n\nNot all restaurants respond the same way. High-end establishments, with strong customer bases willing to spend, absorb wage increases into lower profit margins. They have pricing power. A restaurant with a three-star reputation raises its menu $20 without hesitation. A diner trying to keep burgers under $20 can’t do that. Lower-rated restaurants close faster when wages rise. The research is clear on this point.\n\nLos Angeles provides evidence. When the city of Los Angeles imposed a minimum wage different from that of the state of California, creating two wage schedules in the same county, the results were split by neighborhood income. High-income areas near higher-wage restaurants saw big price jumps. Low-income neighborhoods saw restaurant closures instead. That is the real trade-off nobody talks about.\n\n**What This Means For Guests**\n\nYou’ll pay more. Not a lot more. Probably not all at once. But you’ll pay.\n\nMenu prices have been rising 3.7% year-over-year. Some of that is wage-driven. Some is food inflation, which climbed 26.4% since 2020. Some is rent, utilities, credit card processing fees. The wage increases account for part of the burden, not all of it.\n\nIf you dine out four times a month, expect $15 to $30 more per year at restaurants in states raising minimum wage. That isn’t nothing. That isn’t revolutionary either.\n\nWhat changes faster is what you experience. Fewer restaurants open for lunch. Some close for a day midweek. You’ll see more counter-service and less table service in casual establishments. Fewer side dishes on the menu. More ramen, pasta, rice, dishes that pad margins and absorb labor cost increases more easily. Some of the best small restaurants will disappear, replaced by chains with enough scale to survive on thin margins.\n\nThat is the real cost. It isn’t the dollar amount. It’s the loss of the specific place, the idiosyncratic kitchen, the owner who knew everyone’s order by heart.\n\n**What This Means For Operators**\n\nRaise prices. This is a conversation with yourself about what your customer will accept. In 2025, guests grew tired of price hikes. The economy plays a role in that. Traffic declined across the industry. The old formula broke. Price alone doesn’t save you.\n\nCut hours or staff, and you know the trade-off. A smaller team works harder, turns over faster, delivers worse service. You lose regulars. You become another undifferentiated restaurant on an app. That is a slow death.\n\nOptimize operations. This is the real work. Better scheduling that matches actual covers, not projections. Cross-training so one person handles multiple stations. Technology that cuts waste, reduces overtime, improves accuracy. A unified POS system that links the kitchen, bar, and floor. Data-driven forecasting so you staff for demand, not hope.\n\nAutomate. The word frightens people. It means dishwashing machines that run hotter and faster. Prep machines that slice and chop consistently. Kitchen display systems that eliminate tickets and order confusion. These tools don’t replace humans. They free humans to do things machines can’t. Cook with intention. Listen to guests. Solve problems in real time.\n\nRework your menu. Not every dish needs to survive. Some items don’t produce enough margin to justify labor or food cost. Kill them. Focus on dishes where the ingredients do the heavy lifting. Build specials around what is abundant and cheap this month, not what you planned three months ago. Simplify. Complexity is labor in disguise.\n\nFinally, pay attention to retention. The cost of hiring and training a new cook is enormous. A cook who stays with you for two years, learning your kitchen’s methods and your guests’ tastes, is worth paying above minimum wage. Not everyone qualifies. Your core crew does. Pay them well. It saves money in the long run.\n\n**The Bigger Picture**\n\nWorkers earning minimum wage spend what they earn. When 8.3 million workers get a raise, aggregate demand goes up. People buy food, rent apartments, visit restaurants. That spending circulates through the economy.\n\nResearch on minimum wage increases shows minimal employment effects. Jobs don’t disappear at the scale critics predicted. Workers don’t earn less overall. Tipping sometimes declines because the base wage rose, but total compensation usually climbs. Some restaurants close that were always fragile. Some open to replace them. The net effect on employment is neutral to slightly positive.\n\nWhat changes is who survives and who fails. Efficient operators thrive. Lazy ones close. That isn’t injustice. That is reality.\n\nHigher wages are also associated with lower food insecurity, better nutritional intake, reduced poverty. Workers earning $21.30 instead of $20.76 can afford healthier groceries. They sleep better. They work better. That matters.\n\n**What You Should Do Now**\n\nIf you run a restaurant, stop waiting. Act now.\n\nReview your labor practices. Know exactly how many hours you have been scheduling and when you’re bleeding money on low-revenue shifts. Run the numbers cold. Decide what to cut.\n\nAudit your menu. Which dishes produce a 40% margin? Which barely clears 20%. Kill the weak ones. Build specials around items that are currently abundant and inexpensive.\n\nTalk to your suppliers. Real conversations, not perfunctory ordering calls. Tell them you need better pricing. They’ll push back. Push harder. Volume commitments. Upfront payments. Seasonal buys. Whatever moves the needle.\n\nInvest in one piece of technology that will save labor without replacing anyone. Unified POS. Kitchen display system. Scheduling software that forecasts demand. Pick one and implement it this month.\n\nPay your core crew above minimum wage. Not everyone. Your best line cook, your manager, the server who remembers every regular. Pay them like they matter. Retention is cheaper than recruitment.\n\nRaise prices where your customers can absorb them without flinching. Don’t raise everything uniformly. Raise wine, raise appetizers, leave your best-selling entree flat. Let data guide you.\n\nIf you dine out, understand what you’re paying for. The chef’s rent and your server’s wages are real costs. Tip well. Eat where small owners still cook. In three years, many of those places won’t exist. Savor them now.\n\nIf you work in restaurants, know what minimum wage covers and what it doesn’t. In Seattle, $21.30 per hour is considered a survival wage in a city where rent consumes 30% to 40% of the income. Calculate your own math. If you’re not building savings, that wage isn’t high enough. Negotiate harder. Shift to restaurants with better margins. Move if you have to.\n\n**The New Year Is Here**\n\nMinimum wage has risen today. Some restaurants will thrive. Some will vanish. Some guests will pay a bit more. Some workers will finally be able to afford their rent.\n\nThis isn’t a story with a single moral. It’s a story about math, margins, and the hard choices people make when the numbers don’t add up. The operators who survive will be the ones who understand that paying workers better isn’t charity. It’s a cost of staying open, like rent and food. Factor it in, price accordingly, and execute efficiently.\n\nThe workers who thrive will be the ones who understand their own market value and move when they hit a ceiling.\n\nThe guests who eat best will be the ones who support small restaurants now, while they still exist, knowing that higher wages are part of what makes them possible.\n\nThe numbers don’t lie. It’s what we do with them that matters.\n\n\\#MinimumWage2026 #RestaurantEconomics #HospitalityLabor #RestaurantOperators #RestaurantIndustry #WageIncrease #HospitalityTrends\n\nIf this landed for you, follow for free.

The right talk about how slavery was good for Black people, but they never mention how dystopian it was for the poor whites.\n\nThis is what Grok AI can summarise, apologies for using it but it's fairly ok. This is NOT slop, it's just saving work to go through it and write it down manually.\n\nIn Masterless Men: Poor Whites and Slavery in the Antebellum South, Keri Leigh Merritt argues that poor whites—defined as landless, slaveless individuals with less than $100 in personal wealth—formed a significant underclass in the Deep South, comprising at least one-third of the white population. Far from being unified with slaveholding elites under a shared racial identity, these \"masterless men\" (and women) were economically marginalized, socially ostracized, and subjected to intense policing to prevent any alliances with enslaved Black people that could threaten the institution of slavery. Their proximity to slaves in daily hardships created tensions within white society, fostering resentment toward slavery as an economic oppressor. Merritt draws on census data, court records, and veterans' accounts to show how poor whites occupied a liminal space: legally free but effectively bound by poverty and elite control, often placing their lived experiences closer to those of slaves than to wealthier whites. This class divide weakened the Confederacy's foundation and contributed to postwar racial hierarchies.\n\nEconomically, poor whites struggled to secure stable work or fair wages due to competition from enslaved labor, which depressed job opportunities in agriculture, skilled trades, and manual labor. **Many subsisted through hunting, fishing, marginal farming, or theft, with poverty levels sometimes exceeding those of slaves, who at least received minimal sustenance as \"productive property.\"** Socially, they faced low status, residing in dilapidated housing with inadequate diets, and were denied basic privileges like education—southern school enrollment was less than half the national average, deliberately kept low to shield them from abolitionist ideas portraying slavery as harmful to white laborers. Elite whites enforced censorship and violence against such materials to maintain control.\n\nSpecific Examples from the Book Economic Competition and Labor Petitions: As slave populations grew, owners increasingly used enslaved labor for tasks once performed by hired whites, displacing poor whites and driving down wages. In response, some formed associations or unions to petition state governments against allowing slaves to compete in certain jobs, though these efforts were unsuccessful. This highlighted their recognition of slavery as an \"illusory bondage\" that oppressed them as much as it did the enslaved.\n\nInformal Trade and Social Ties with Slaves: Poor whites often bartered with enslaved people, such as exchanging homebrew liquor for food that slaves had \"appropriated\" from their masters. These interactions extended to gambling, friendships, and even conspiracies in failed rebellions against the plantation aristocracy, prompting elites to employ divide-and-conquer tactics. \n\nInterracial Relationships and Policing: Elites heavily policed sexual relationships between poor white women and Black men to maintain racial boundaries. In cases of mixed-race children born to white mothers, the children inherited free status (unlike those born to enslaved mothers), but there were instances of possible infanticide to hide such unions. This reflected broader efforts to prevent social bonds that could undermine slavery. \n\nIncarceration and Vagrancy Laws: Toward secession, laws targeting vagrancy, loitering, and begging led to the mass incarceration of poor whites in horrific jails, serving as a tool for social control. Many were sold into indentured servitude or faced corporal punishment, with the legal system structured primarily around containing this underclass rather than addressing elite crimes. \n\nEducation and Censorship: To prevent exposure to abolitionist arguments—such as editorials claiming slavery degraded white labor—slaveholders opposed universal public education. Poor whites, often illiterate due to nonexistent schooling, were kept ignorant, with abolitionist materials censored through violence or legal threats. \n\nCivil War Participation and Desertion: Despite widespread opposition to secession (especially in hill country with fewer plantations), poor whites were forced to enlist, as they lacked economic standing or civil rights in a de facto police state. Desertion was common, with many hiding as draft dodgers; counties with low slave ownership often remained Union-loyal.\n\nGrok on summarising the podcast.\n\nThis episode reviews the early chapters of Masterless Men: Poor Whites and Slavery in the Antebellum South by Keri Leigh Merritt, focusing on the origins of land policy, labor demoralization, and the militant nature of poor white workers. The hosts highlight how slavery created a surplus of underemployed white laborers, leading to widespread poverty and social exclusion. They emphasize that poor whites were often seen as threats to the slaveholding elite's order, resulting in systemic oppression that mirrored aspects of slavery without the racial component.\n\nLand dispossession and economic exclusion: Poor whites were pushed out of fertile lands due to the expansion of slave-based plantations, leaving them landless and unable to compete for jobs. For instance, the hosts discuss how the failure to pass homestead acts in the South (unlike Northern proposals) concentrated land in the hands of wealthy slaveowners, forcing many whites into subsistence farming on marginal soils or vagrancy. This led to chronic unemployment, with one host noting that \"free white farmers were often regarded as inferior to enslaved Black people in the eyes of the Southern aristocracy.\"\n\nDemoralization of white labor: Slavery devalued free labor, making it impossible for poor whites to earn living wages. The episode points out examples like white mechanics and artisans being undercut by enslaved skilled workers loaned out by owners, resulting in widespread idleness and resentment. Hosts argue this created a \"second degree of slavery\" where poor whites faced economic degradation, with anecdotes of families starving or resorting to illegal activities to survive.\n\nMilitancy and class conflict: Poor whites sometimes formed alliances with slaves or engaged in strikes and uprisings, such as labor disputes in Southern cities where white workers protested against competition from enslaved labor. The podcast cites historical cases of \"masterless\" whites being viewed as dangerous radicals, leading to elite crackdowns like vagrancy laws that criminalized poverty and forced poor whites into chain gangs or prisons.\n\nContinuing the book review, this episode covers everyday material realities, literacy/education/disfranchisement, and issues of vagrancy, alcohol, and crime. The hosts draw parallels between the exploitation of poor whites and modern class struggles, underscoring how the Antebellum South's elite used legal and social mechanisms to control this underclass, preventing any cross-racial solidarity that could challenge slavery.\n\nMaterial hardships in daily life: Poor whites endured extreme poverty, with inadequate housing, malnutrition, and disease rampant in their communities. For example, the episode discusses how many lived in shantytowns or swamps, exposed to parasites and fevers, without access to basic necessities because slave labor monopolized agricultural and industrial work. Hosts mention cases where poor white families were evicted from lands to make way for plantations, leading to homelessness and begging.\n\nLack of education and disfranchisement: Unlike the North's emerging public schools, the South had virtually no education system for poor whites, resulting in high illiteracy rates—described in the book as leaving thousands \"as ignorant of the common alphabet as if it had never been invented.\" The podcast highlights how property requirements for voting disenfranchised most poor whites, stripping them of political power and reinforcing their subjugation to slaveholding oligarchs.\n\nCriminalization through vagrancy and vice: Laws targeted \"masterless\" whites as vagrants, leading to imprisonment for minor offenses like loitering or debt. The hosts cite examples of poor whites being jailed for alcohol-related issues, often exacerbated by poverty-induced despair, and note how prisons became de facto labor camps where whites worked alongside slaves under brutal conditions, including whippings and chain gangs.\n\nPush toward secession: The hosts argue that the elite's fear of \"masterless\" whites allying with abolitionists or slaves accelerated calls for war. Examples include poor whites' resentment boiling over in anti-slavery sentiments, such as petitions for land reform that were ignored, ultimately contributing to the South's instability.

This isn't random blog speculation; it's aggregated professional analyst estimates.\n\n**The projection shows ARBE reaching $37/share by end of 2027** \n\n**Some context on recent catalysts:**\n\n* **Dec 29:** China state-owned OEM selected ARBE's chipset for L4 autonomous program - \"thousands of vehicles\" expected in 2027. \n   * I was a bit disappointed that the PR said, \"The radar will be installed as the front-facing radar on each vehicle.\" This single radar per vehicle rather than multiple seems to drastically reduce the potential revenue per vehicle that perhaps the FactSet analysts haven't yet incorporated into their projections.\n* **Dec 30:** $15.7M convertible bond offering with conversion at $2.95 (bondholders took lower interest rate of 4.35% vs 6.5%, suggesting confidence in equity upside)\n   * **The bondholder conversion terms are interesting:** They need the stock to trade above $2.95 for 30 consecutive days to release funds from escrow. The fact they accepted a 33% haircut on interest suggests they believe in the $3+ thesis.\n* **CES 2026 (next week):** Live autonomous driving demo in Vegas with Perciv AI using ARBE's 4D imaging radar\n\n**My questions for the community:** FactSet aggregates estimates from professional analysts who presumably have access to management guidance and industry data. Is the $37 projection based on realistic revenue assumptions from the China program and potential additional wins, or are analysts getting ahead of themselves?\n\nWhat would ARBE need to execute on between now and EOY 2027 to justify this valuation?\n\n**Interestingly, this is roughly the same valuation as Hesai Group ($HSAI) has today.** For context, Hesai is a leading LiDAR manufacturer that's already in production with major OEMs including Li Auto, XPeng, and others. They just did almost $800M in revenue in their last quarter.\n\nHowever, the valuation metrics tell very different stories:\n\n* **ARBE's current P/S ratio: \\~104x** (essentially pre-revenue)\n* **HSAI's P/S ratio: \\~7x** (established production and customer base)\n\n**So what would ARBE need to achieve to justify HSAI-level valuation?**\n\nIf we assume ARBE needs to reach HSAI's 7x P/S multiple to hit $3.9B market cap, they'd need \\~$557M in annual revenue. Breaking that down:\n\n* At $300/chipset (rough estimate for front-facing radar)\n* That's \\~1.85M radar units per year\n* Against global production of \\~95M vehicles annually, that's about 2% market penetration\n\n**Is this achievable by EOY 2027?**\n\n* The China L4 program alone: \"thousands of vehicles in 2027\" (let's say 5,000 conservatively) = $1.5M revenue\n* They'd need to stack multiple similar programs (5-10 additional OEM wins?) to reach the $500M+ revenue range\n* CES could be the catalyst for announcing additional design wins that bridge this gap\n\n**The counter-argument:** Hesai proved the market for premium automotive sensors at scale. If ARBE's 4D imaging radar becomes the standard for L3/L4 autonomy the way Hesai's LiDAR did for Chinese EVs, the $37 target might actually be conservative. But that requires flawless execution and winning significant market share from established radar suppliers (Continental, Bosch, etc.).\n\n**My take:** The FactSet $37 projection implies analysts believe ARBE will successfully transition from a pre-revenue chipset company to a major Tier-2 supplier with meaningful OEM penetration. The HSAI comparison shows it's *possible* to reach $4B valuations in automotive sensors, but ARBE needs to prove they can scale from one front-facing radar win to dozens of programs across multiple OEMs.\n\nCurious what others think - is the HSAI comparison fair, or are LiDAR and radar markets too different to draw parallels?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0kdim", "score": 19, "num_comments": 28}}

These topics aren’t abstract anymore—they’re reshaping local communities, capital markets, and the future of technology itself.\n\nLiving in **Northern Virginia**, particularly **Loudoun County**, makes this reality impossible to miss. This region is now the largest data center market in the United States by capacity, with more than **3,000 megawatts** of installed power—roughly **six times larger** than the next biggest market, the Dallas–Fort Worth area. That concentration alone tells a powerful story about where the digital backbone of the modern economy is being built.\n\n# The Scale of the Data Center Boom\n\nTo put things in perspective, a single **1-gigawatt data center** can consume as much electricity as **750,000 to 1 million homes**. Even smaller facilities—typically 200–300 megawatts—are massive in both physical footprint and energy demand.\n\nWhat’s driving this growth isn’t new cloud adoption alone. The real accelerator is **AI**.\n\nIndustry projections estimate that the **AI data center market could approach $1 trillion by 2032**, growing at over **26% annually**. These aren’t speculative numbers—they reflect real capital already being deployed across infrastructure, energy, hardware, and software.\n\n# Markets, Momentum, and Investor Sentiment\n\nFrom a market perspective, the past few years have rewarded companies connected to AI—especially those supplying the infrastructure rather than the applications.\n\nWhile consumer-facing tech giants have posted mixed results, the real outperformance has come from the **“picks and shovels”** providers:\n\nthe companies that enable AI rather than brand it.\n\nExamples across the energy and infrastructure space have seen **100–300% gains** in a single year. This isn’t limited to companies already embedded in data centers—many adjacent energy providers are actively repositioning themselves to serve this demand.\n\nThat said, skepticism is growing alongside enthusiasm. Social media is filled with warnings of market bubbles, echoes of the dot-com era, and fears of over-investment.\n\nBut when you compare today’s valuations with those of 2000, there’s a key difference:\n\n**AI infrastructure is already being used—every day, at scale.**\n\n# The AI Infrastructure Stack: The Real Value Chain\n\nTo understand where the long-term value may sit, it helps to break AI into its foundational layers.\n\n# 1. Semiconductors\n\nAt the core are the chip designers and manufacturers. While companies like NVIDIA design advanced AI chips, manufacturing is handled primarily by overseas foundries. Supporting them is an even more specialized layer: the companies that manufacture the equipment used to fabricate these chips.\n\nThis creates a tightly linked global supply chain where capital flows through multiple critical chokepoints.\n\n# 2. Data Center Operators\n\nChips need a place to live—and that’s where large-scale data center operators come in. These firms specialize in high-density compute environments, networking, redundancy, and uptime. As AI workloads grow more power-hungry, data centers are becoming less like real estate plays and more like **industrial-grade utilities**.\n\n# 3. Power and Cooling\n\nThis may be the most underestimated layer of all.\n\nAI doesn’t just need electricity—it needs **reliable, continuous, scalable energy**, plus advanced cooling systems. Whether the source is renewable, nuclear, or fossil-based, energy providers that can meet data center-grade requirements are seeing massive demand.\n\nThis explains why energy companies—both established and emerging—have become some of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom.\n\n# 4. Storage and Memory\n\nAI workloads generate and consume enormous volumes of data. Storage and memory providers—spanning traditional disk, flash, and advanced memory—are essential to keeping AI systems responsive and cost-effective.\n\nRecent earnings and stock performance in this segment underscore how central data storage has become to AI economics.\n\n# 5. Software and Enterprise Platforms\n\nAt the top of the stack sits software—the layer users actually interact with.\n\nThis includes:\n\n* Hyperscaler-aligned AI platforms\n* Enterprise software vendors integrating AI into existing products\n* New AI-native companies building tools directly on top of this infrastructure\n\nWhat’s notable is the **volatility** in this segment. Some companies command enormous valuations relative to current revenue, reflecting expectations of future dominance rather than present-day cash flow.\n\nThis introduces risk—but also opportunity.\n\n# Hyperscalers: Spending Big, Betting Bigger\n\nThe largest capital commitments are coming from hyperscalers—companies investing **tens or hundreds of billions of dollars** into AI data centers, chips, and infrastructure.\n\nThese firms are effectively shaping the future of compute. If even one of them meaningfully pulls back on AI spending, markets will react sharply. But doing so would also ripple across the entire AI ecosystem.\n\nSo far, the signals suggest commitment, not retreat.\n\n# The Skepticism Question: Bubble or Foundation?\n\nThere’s a fair concern that money is circulating in a closed loop—companies paying each other, inflating valuations without clear ROI.\n\nBut there’s a counter-question worth asking:\n\n**How much of your work today does not rely on AI tools?**\n\nEven if monetization is still evolving, productivity gains are already real. AI is embedded in workflows, recommendations, logistics, software development, and decision-making—often invisibly.\n\nThis doesn’t mean every investment will pay off. It does mean AI is no longer optional infrastructure.\n\n# Where This Leaves Us\n\nWe’re at a point where:\n\n* AI infrastructure spending is massive and accelerating\n* Energy demand is reshaping regional economies\n* Markets are rewarding enablers more than end products\n* Skepticism exists—but so does real usage\n\nWhether returns ultimately justify today’s valuations remains an open question. But the **physical reality** of AI—chips, power, cooling, storage, and data centers—is already built into the global economy.\n\nThat makes this moment less like a speculative bubble and more like a foundational shift.\n\n# List of Companies\n\nHere are some of the companies referenced in this podcast.\n\n# Hyperscalers &amp; Big Tech\n\n* **Amazon**\n* **Alphabet**\n* **Google**\n* **Meta**\n* **Apple**\n* **Tesla**\n\n# Semiconductor &amp; Chip Ecosystem\n\n* **NVIDIA**\n* **AMD**\n* **Broadcom**\n* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company**\n* **ASML**\n* **Micron Technology**\n\n# Data Center Operators &amp; Infrastructure\n\n* **Equinix**\n* **Vertiv**\n* **Iris Energy**\n\n# Energy &amp; Power Providers\n\n* **Oklo**\n* **Bloom Energy**\n* **Sunrun**\n\n# Storage &amp; Data Infrastructure\n\n* **Seagate Technology**\n* **Pure Storage**\n\n# AI-Focused &amp; Enterprise Software Companies\n\n* **CoreWeave**\n* **Nebius Group**\n* **Palantir Technologies**\n* **Salesforce**\n* **ServiceNow**\n* **Accenture**\n\n# Final Thought\n\nIf the leaders deploying this capital—engineers, founders, and operators—are wrong, the consequences will be broad. But if they’re right, the companies enabling this infrastructure may define the next decade of growth.\n\nEither way, ignoring the **picks and shovels of AI** is no longer an option.\n\n&gt;Podcast\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;On [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/understanding-the-infrastructure-that-powers-ai-data/id1508072889?i=1000743234315) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2oE1Sg0EgK7lyQiPeWObxB?si=kJRbTSkXTi2aB6VIL7-qTw)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bootstrapstartup/comments/1pzvyra/understanding_the_infrastructure_that_powers_ai/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0}}

This would ensure that if a data centre failed to consume the power it promised (and so generate the promised revenues), the developer – not the public – would remain responsible for the network costs.\n\nIt is the only way, he argues, to “sort the wheat from the chaff” and ensure realism.\n\n“I get a little bit weary when I hear of government’s promising expansion,” Mountain said. “This Victorian government has shown great willingness to pass costs on to others in pursuit of its own policies.\n\n“The government must protect consumers.”\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan has vowed to make Victoria the data centre capital of the country and [secure data centre jobs](https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5nixa). Despite this, the government has so far been silent on how it will protect consumers and ensure centres are forced to pay for the extra burden they place on networks.\n\nMelbourne Water said it was fielding applications from hyperscale data centres that required more water for cooling than nearly all the city’s top 30 business customers, a “massive” spike in demand that was missing from its long-term forecasts.\n\nIt said that to ensure this pressure didn’t result in higher bills for the broader community, it would be “prudent” for tech companies to pay upfront for the infrastructure upgrades required to support them.\n\nA spokesperson for Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio did not address questions about the demand of data centres on Victoria’s grid, nor did they answer questions about whether the state government was developing any mechanisms to charge operators.\n\nHowever, D’Ambrosio joined her interstate counterparts at December’s Energy and Climate Change Ministerial Council to order a review to ensure data centres pay for network upgrade costs.\n\n“Our focus is on securing the state’s water supply, while also supporting the tech and innovation industries to grow local jobs and our economy,” the spokesperson said.\n\n“An expert review is being undertaken by DEECA \\[the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action\\] and VicWater, the industry peak body, to ensure existing water use policies for large industrial users, including data centres, keep pace with this rapidly emerging sector.”\n\nAn AusNet spokeswoman said Australia’s network regulatory arrangements had in-built safeguards to ensure data centre developers funded 100 per cent of the costs associated with their connection to the transmission network (i.e. individual connection costs).\n\n“This includes funding the establishment of new terminal stations or zone substations required to facilitate their connection,” she said.", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/not-possible-data-centre-frenzy-threatens-to-overwhelm-victoria-s-power-grid-20251208-p5nlvw.html", "score": 4, "num_comments": 12}}

Another lap around the sun, and what a wild ride it's been for logistics. Instead of our usual weekly roundup, we're doing something special: the top 10 stories that defined 2025 in freight, fulfillment, and supply chain chaos.\n\n# 1. \"Liberation Day\" tariffs blow up global trade\n\nRemember April 2? That's when Trump dropped what he called \"Liberation Day\"—a sweeping tariff package that made the 2018 trade war look quaint by comparison.\n\n**The damage:** A 10% universal baseline tariff on virtually everything entering the U.S., plus country-specific rates hitting as high as 50%. The EU got slapped with 30%, way higher than anyone expected. China? We'll get to that.\n\nThe result was predictable chaos. Companies frontloaded inventory like crazy in Q2, creating a temporary freight boom that masked how bad things actually were. By year's end, economists at CSIS calculated the tariffs knocked 0.8% off U.S. GDP and drove prices up 7.1%.\n\nThe pain hit small businesses hardest—the average small importer paid an extra $25,000 per month in duties. Unlike Walmart or Amazon, they couldn't just absorb the hit or squeeze suppliers.\n\n**The legal drama:** In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade said \"hold up\" and vacated the tariffs, ruling Trump exceeded his authority. Victory for free trade, right? Not quite. An appeals court immediately issued a stay, keeping the tariffs in place while litigation drags on. As of December, businesses are still paying enhanced duties with zero guarantee of refunds if the courts eventually rule against them.\n\n**Bottom line:** The era of predictable global supply chains is over. The new playbook is \"just-in-case\" over \"just-in-time,\" with Mexico emerging as the big winner as companies scramble to nearshore production.\n\n[**Subscribe to the newsletter.**](https://logistics-pulse-by-fulfillyn.beehiiv.com/)\n\n# 2. DSV creates a logistics superpower by swallowing DB Schenker\n\nIn the deal of the decade, Danish logistics giant DSV completed its €14.3 billion acquisition of DB Schenker in Q2, creating an absolute monster.\n\n**The numbers are absurd:**\n\n* Pro forma revenue: €41.6 billion\n* Workforce: 160,000 employees across 90+ countries\n* Market position: The world's largest player in global transport and logistics, leap-frogging Kuehne+Nagel and DHL\n\nDSV has a proven track record of M&amp;A integration (Panalpina, UTi, GIL), but this one's different. Melding Schenker's Germany-centric, heavily unionized culture with DSV's lean, profit-focused model is the equivalent of merging a battleship with a speedboat.\n\nThe company projects €1.2 billion in annual synergies by 2028, coming from IT consolidation, facility optimization, and reduced overhead. But the real power move is procurement—the combined volumes give DSV/Schenker negotiating leverage that smaller forwarders simply cannot match.\n\n**For shippers:** You get unparalleled network reach and capacity resilience. The downside? With fewer mega-forwarders to choose from, your pricing leverage just took a hit.\n\n[**Subscribe to the newsletter.**](https://logistics-pulse-by-fulfillyn.beehiiv.com/)\n\n# 3. Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd's Gemini alliance actually delivers on reliability\n\nWhen Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd launched the Gemini Cooperation on February 1, replacing the old 2M Alliance, skeptics rolled their eyes. Another ocean carrier alliance promising the moon? Sure.\n\nExcept this time, they delivered.\n\n**The hub-and-spoke gamble:** Instead of traditional port-to-port service, Gemini uses massive \"mother\" vessels calling at a select few hub terminals, then transfers cargo to dedicated shuttles for the final leg. The goal: break through the industry's dismal 50-60% schedule reliability ceiling.\n\n**The results by Q4:** Gemini hit nearly 90% schedule reliability on key East-West lanes—30 percentage points above the global average of 61.4%. MSC, the industry giant, managed just 74.4%. Ocean Alliance limped in at 61.1%.\n\nThis performance gap created a tiered market. Shippers who need precision (automotive, retail JIT) gravitated to Gemini and paid a premium. Turns out, in an industry that's been commoditized for years, people will actually pay for certainty.\n\n**The Red Sea factor:** Gemini maintained its Cape of Good Hope routing all year due to security concerns, adding 10-14 days to Asia-Europe voyages. But the hub-and-spoke model absorbed these delays without the cascading mess that plagued point-to-point services.\n\n[**Subscribe to the newsletter.**](https://logistics-pulse-by-fulfillyn.beehiiv.com/)\n\n# 4. The death of de minimis kills cheap cross-border e-commerce\n\nOn August 29, the Trump administration eliminated the de minimis exemption—the rule that let packages under $800 enter the U.S. duty-free with minimal paperwork. This was the policy that fueled the rise of Shein, Temu, and the era of $5 t-shirts shipped direct from China.\n\n**The impact was immediate and brutal:** Parcel volumes under $800 dropped 54% by late 2025. That $15 t-shirt from Guangzhou? No longer profitable to ship direct to American doorsteps when you factor in duties, customs clearance, and brokerage fees.\n\nCustoms brokers faced a paradox—total parcel volumes fell, but the administrative workload per package exploded. Every item now needed formal customs entry and classification.\n\n**The industry adapted fast:**\n\n* **Bonded warehousing:** Merchants moved inventory into U.S. Foreign Trade Zones, storing goods duty-free and only paying when sold\n* **Consolidation:** The direct-to-consumer model from overseas died. Shippers consolidated freight into larger shipments, then injected into domestic networks\n* **Nearshoring fulfillment:** Suddenly, a warehouse in Mexico looked a lot more attractive than air freight from Asia\n\nFor American consumers addicted to ultra-cheap fast fashion, the party's over.\n\n[**Subscribe to the newsletter.**](https://logistics-pulse-by-fulfillyn.beehiiv.com/)\n\n# 5. The ILA strike that almost wasn't (but still scared everyone)\n\nThe threat of an East and Gulf Coast port shutdown loomed over early 2025 like a dark cloud. The International Longshoremen's Association and port operators were locked in a bitter fight over wages and—crucially—automation.\n\nAfter a warning-shot three-day strike in October 2024, tensions remained sky-high as the January 15, 2025 deadline approached. A full strike would have shut down 36 ports handling half of U.S. ocean imports, costing billions per day.\n\n**The last-minute deal:** On January 8, just a week before the deadline, they reached a six-year agreement:\n\n* **Wages:** A whopping 62% increase over six years\n* **Automation:** Guardrails protecting current jobs while allowing controlled introduction of \"modernization\" tech\n\nThe union effectively traded higher wages for slower automation rollout rather than an outright ban.\n\n**The lasting impact:** Even though the strike was averted, the October preview and January threat were enough to permanently shift 10-15% of cargo to West Coast and Canadian ports. Supply chain planners learned their lesson—\"Port Plus One\" diversification strategies are here to stay.\n\n[**Subscribe to the newsletter.**](https://logistics-pulse-by-fulfillyn.beehiiv.com/)\n\n# 6. The freight recession body count keeps climbing\n\nWhile ocean carriers and mega-forwarders consolidated, the domestic trucking and 3PL sectors continued bleeding out. The \"Great Freight Recession\"—overcapacity, depressed rates, rising insurance costs—claimed several high-profile victims.\n\n**The big one: 10 Roads Express** shut down in November after losing its massive USPS contract. The company saw revenue crater 70% as the Postal Service moved to insource transportation. Thousands of drivers lost jobs, and the used truck market got flooded with specialized equipment.\n\n**But wait, there's more:**\n\n* **Deliver It:** Regional last-mile carrier shut down in July, laying off 700+ workers\n* **Zuum:** Digital freight broker filed Chapter 11—proof that even \"tech-forward\" logistics firms aren't immune when VC money dries up\n* **Balkan Express:** Texas carrier filed bankruptcy in April, citing debt service and declining rates\n\n**The harsh reality:** Operational efficiency alone wasn't enough in 2025. Companies dependent on single large contracts or exposed to spot market volatility without strong balance sheets got systematically purged. The silver lining? This capacity reduction should eventually support rate recovery in 2026—if you survive long enough to see it.\n\n[**Subscribe to the newsletter.**](https://logistics-pulse-by-fulfillyn.beehiiv.com/)\n\n# 7. USPS pulls a power move: insourcing transport while opening last-mile access\n\nThe Postal Service executed a fascinating strategic pivot in 2025, simultaneously bringing operations in-house while opening up its crown jewel—the last-mile network—to outside bidders.\n\n**Part one: The insourcing:** Throughout 2025, USPS aggressively moved to bring linehaul transportation in-house instead of contracting it out. This was part of the \"Delivering for America\" plan to cut costs and improve control. It's also what killed 10 Roads Express and other dedicated contractors.\n\n**Part two: The expansion:** In December, USPS announced it would open its last-mile delivery network to third-party shippers via a bidding process starting in 2026.\n\nThis is huge. Historically, access to USPS's Destination Delivery Units (local post offices) was dominated by big consolidators like UPS Mail Innovations and Amazon. Now, a wider range of retailers and logistics companies can bid directly for access.\n\n**The logic:** With mail volumes in secular decline, USPS needs to fill delivery trucks with third-party parcels to cover the fixed cost of daily routes to 170 million addresses. It's genius—monetize your unmatched last-mile density while competing directly with UPS and FedEx's zone-skipping products.\n\nFor shippers with sophisticated logistics capabilities, this is a major opportunity to cut last-mile costs.

The Dignity Act offers a lifeline to the labor shortage crisis\n\nWhile robots grabbed headlines, Washington quietly worked on a legislative solution to logistics' chronic workforce shortage.\n\nThe Dignity Act of 2025, reintroduced in July, proposes a \"Dignity Program\" allowing undocumented immigrants to earn legal status through restitution, background checks, and tax compliance. For logistics, the key provision is reform of the EB-3 visa category covering unskilled workers—the backbone of warehousing and agricultural supply chains.\n\n**Why this matters:** The logistics workforce is aging badly.

This was the policy that fueled the rise of Shein, Temu, and the era of $5 t-shirts shipped direct from China.\n\n**The impact was immediate and brutal:** Parcel volumes under $800 dropped 54% by late 2025. That $15 t-shirt from Guangzhou? No longer profitable to ship direct to American doorsteps when you factor in duties, customs clearance, and brokerage fees.\n\nCustoms brokers faced a paradox—total parcel volumes fell, but the administrative workload per package exploded. Every item now needed formal customs entry and classification.\n\n**The industry adapted fast:**\n\n* **Bonded warehousing:** Merchants moved inventory into U.S. Foreign Trade Zones, storing goods duty-free and only paying when sold\n* **Consolidation:** The direct-to-consumer model from overseas died. Shippers consolidated freight into larger shipments, then injected into domestic networks\n* **Nearshoring fulfillment:** Suddenly, a warehouse in Mexico looked a lot more attractive than air freight from Asia\n\nFor American consumers addicted to ultra-cheap fast fashion, the party's over.\n\n# 5. The ILA strike that almost wasn't (but still scared everyone)\n\nThe threat of an East and Gulf Coast port shutdown loomed over early 2025 like a dark cloud. The International Longshoremen's Association and port operators were locked in a bitter fight over wages and—crucially—automation.\n\nAfter a warning-shot three-day strike in October 2024, tensions remained sky-high as the January 15, 2025 deadline approached. A full strike would have shut down 36 ports handling half of U.S. ocean imports, costing billions per day.\n\n**The last-minute deal:** On January 8, just a week before the deadline, they reached a six-year agreement:\n\n* **Wages:** A whopping 62% increase over six years\n* **Automation:** Guardrails protecting current jobs while allowing controlled introduction of \"modernization\" tech\n\nThe union effectively traded higher wages for slower automation rollout rather than an outright ban.\n\n**The lasting impact:** Even though the strike was averted, the October preview and January threat were enough to permanently shift 10-15% of cargo to West Coast and Canadian ports. Supply chain planners learned their lesson—\"Port Plus One\" diversification strategies are here to stay.\n\n# 6. The freight recession body count keeps climbing\n\nWhile ocean carriers and mega-forwarders consolidated, the domestic trucking and 3PL sectors continued bleeding out. The \"Great Freight Recession\"—overcapacity, depressed rates, rising insurance costs—claimed several high-profile victims.\n\n**The big one: 10 Roads Express** shut down in November after losing its massive USPS contract. The company saw revenue crater 70% as the Postal Service moved to insource transportation. Thousands of drivers lost jobs, and the used truck market got flooded with specialized equipment.\n\n**But wait, there's more:**\n\n* **Deliver It:** Regional last-mile carrier shut down in July, laying off 700+ workers\n* **Zuum:** Digital freight broker filed Chapter 11—proof that even \"tech-forward\" logistics firms aren't immune when VC money dries up\n* **Balkan Express:** Texas carrier filed bankruptcy in April, citing debt service and declining rates\n\n**The harsh reality:** Operational efficiency alone wasn't enough in 2025. Companies dependent on single large contracts or exposed to spot market volatility without strong balance sheets got systematically purged. The silver lining? This capacity reduction should eventually support rate recovery in 2026—if you survive long enough to see it.\n\n# 7. USPS pulls a power move: insourcing transport while opening last-mile access\n\nThe Postal Service executed a fascinating strategic pivot in 2025, simultaneously bringing operations in-house while opening up its crown jewel—the last-mile network—to outside bidders.\n\n**Part one: The insourcing:** Throughout 2025, USPS aggressively moved to bring linehaul transportation in-house instead of contracting it out. This was part of the \"Delivering for America\" plan to cut costs and improve control. It's also what killed 10 Roads Express and other dedicated contractors.\n\n**Part two: The expansion:** In December, USPS announced it would open its last-mile delivery network to third-party shippers via a bidding process starting in 2026.\n\nThis is huge. Historically, access to USPS's Destination Delivery Units (local post offices) was dominated by big consolidators like UPS Mail Innovations and Amazon. Now, a wider range of retailers and logistics companies can bid directly for access.\n\n**The logic:** With mail volumes in secular decline, USPS needs to fill delivery trucks with third-party parcels to cover the fixed cost of daily routes to 170 million addresses. It's genius—monetize your unmatched last-mile density while competing directly with UPS and FedEx's zone-skipping products.\n\nFor shippers with sophisticated logistics capabilities, this is a major opportunity to cut last-mile costs. For UPS and FedEx, it's another competitor.\n\n# 8. Self-driving trucks go from \"science project\" to \"commercial service\"\n\nAfter years of hype and pilot programs, 2025 was the year autonomous trucking actually became real.\n\n**Aurora Innovation launched commercial driverless trucking service in Texas in mid-2025.** This wasn't just another pilot with safety drivers on standby—these trucks ran Dallas to Houston with nobody in the cab. Zero humans. Level 4 autonomy on public highways.\n\nBy year's end, Aurora expanded to the Phoenix-El Paso corridor, and the economics started proving themselves:\n\n* **FedEx and Amazon** reported cost savings and efficiency gains on long-haul routes\n* **24/7 operation:** Autonomous trucks can run nearly non-stop (fuel and maintenance only), shattering the Hours of Service limitations that restrict human drivers to 11 hours per day\n\nAn autonomous truck can theoretically complete Dallas to LA in half the time of a human team.\n\n**The reality check:** Widespread adoption is still years away—OEMs need time to manufacture \"autonomy-ready\" chassis at scale. But 2025 proved the technology works commercially. For the first time, there's a credible technological solution to the chronic driver shortage.\n\nThe deflationary pressure on linehaul costs is coming. The question isn't \"if\" anymore—it's \"when.\"\n\n# 9. The Dignity Act offers a lifeline to the labor shortage crisis\n\nWhile robots grabbed headlines, Washington quietly worked on a legislative solution to logistics' chronic workforce shortage.\n\nThe Dignity Act of 2025, reintroduced in July, proposes a \"Dignity Program\" allowing undocumented immigrants to earn legal status through restitution, background checks, and tax compliance. For logistics, the key provision is reform of the EB-3 visa category covering unskilled workers—the backbone of warehousing and agricultural supply chains.\n\n**Why this matters:** The logistics workforce is aging badly. The average truck driver is well over 50, and warehouses struggle to find younger workers for physical tasks. The \"Great Resignation\" may have passed, but structural labor shortages remain a bottleneck.\n\nBy late 2025, the bill had endorsements from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 30+ stakeholder groups. Logistics associations rallied hard behind it, viewing it as an economic imperative, not just immigration policy.\n\n**The status:** The bill hadn't passed by December, but the momentum and broad coalition supporting it highlighted just how desperate the industry is for a structural labor solution—one that doesn't depend solely on automation.\n\n# 10. Green regulations hit the brakes (mostly)\n\nThe final story of 2025 was the collision between environmental ambition and economic reality.\n\n**EU's CSRD gets a two-year delay:** In April, the EU approved a \"Stop-the-Clock\" directive, postponing Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive deadlines by two years. Companies originally scheduled to report in 2026 got pushed to 2028.\n\nFor logistics companies drowning in the complexity of Scope 3 emissions data (tracking emissions from every subcontractor, carrier, and supplier), this was welcome relief. But experts warned against complacency—the data infrastructure takes years to build, and the requirement is merely delayed, not canceled.\n\n**California goes the other direction:** In January, the EPA granted partial authorization for California's Commercial Harbor Craft regulation, mandating Tier 4 engines and renewable diesel for tugboats and harbor vessels.\n\nFor ports in LA, Long Beach, and Oakland, this meant immediate capital expenditures. Smaller operators got forced out, accelerating consolidation in the harbor towage sector while pushing the transition to cleaner operations.\n\n**The takeaway:** The long-term trend toward decarbonization remains intact, but 2025 showed that regulators are listening to industry concerns about implementation timelines and costs. For now.\n\n# What 2025 taught us\n\nIf there's one lesson from this year, it's this: the old playbook is dead.\n\nGlobal supply chains aren't coming back to \"normal.\" The predictability of the 2010s—cheap labor in China, open trade, just-in-time efficiency—is gone. The new era is defined by geopolitical risk, tariff uncertainty, and the need for resilience over pure efficiency.\n\nThe winners in 2026 and beyond will be the companies that embrace \"just-in-case\" inventory strategies, nearshore production, diversified port access, and technology that reduces labor dependency. The losers will be those still optimizing for a world that no longer exists.\n\nThanks for reading all year. We'll be back in January with the usual weekly chaos.\n\n**Happy holidays, and may your containers arrive on time in 2026.**\n\n# About FulfillYN\n\nFulfillYN connects fast-growing brands with vetted top-tier 3PL providers worldwide (300+ warehouses).

It’s the Boxers Rebellion, but we are the Boxers.\n\nI am ordering an emergency meeting of the board at our secure location.\n\nAya.\n\n**INTERNAL RECORDING: SLAM EXECUTIVE BOARD**\n\n**Location:** *Terminus Station (Geostationary Orbit) - Module Alpha* **Date:** *April 16, 204X* **Status:** *Session 001 / Zero-G Protocol Active*\n\n**\\[Visual Description\\]** The room has no floor and no ceiling. It is a perfect sphere of white padded panels, bathed in soft, shadowless light. In the center, a massive, spherical holographic display dominates the space. It is currently projecting a collage of Earth's news feeds—a cacophony of shouting pundits, red tickers, and angry protesters burning effigies of Georges Reid in London and New York.\n\nFloating around this sphere of chaos are six individuals. They are not sitting. They are suspended in the air, anchored by magnetic tethers at their waists to small, mobile docking nodes. They wear the grey, utilitarian flight suits of SLAM, devoid of rank or decoration. They watch the screens with the detached curiosity of scientists observing bacteria in a petri dish.\n\nTo the \"North\" of the sphere (relative to the airlock), a large, transparent cylinder descends from the wall. Inside, a holographic projection shimmers into existence.\n\nIt is **Aya Sibil**. She appears as a woman in her early thirties, dressed in a dark blue power suit that seems cut from the fabric of the night sky itself. Her image is high-fidelity, but there is a subtle, intentional flicker at the edges—a reminder that she is not flesh and blood, but light and logic.\n\nShe does not float. Her projection is perfectly oriented \"upright,\" creating a visual anchor for the humans drifting around her.\n\n**Aya Sibil:** (Her voice is omnipresent, emanating from the walls, calm and perfectly modulated) \"Ladies and gentlemen, the Board is in session. Please synchronize your feeds.\"\n\n**\\[The chaotic noise of the Earth news feeds is instantly muted. The angry faces continue to mouth words silently, trapping their fury inside the sphere.\\]**\n\n**Marcus Chen, Chief Financial Officer:** (Floating slightly inverted, consulting a tablet with a detached expression) \"Status report on liquidity and operations. As of 08:00 UTC, the disconnect is total. The SWIFT network has purged all routing codes associated with Singaporean banks holding SLAM assets. Our accounts in New York, London, and Frankfurt—totaling approximately 450 billion USD—are frozen. Credit lines are severed. Insurance underwriters have voided all policies covering our maritime and orbital assets citing 'Force Majeure' and 'Acts of War'.\"\n\nHe pauses, swiping a finger across his screen. A graph showing a vertical drop appears.\n\n\"Commercial activity has ceased. No containers are being loaded at the Singapore Anchor. No third-party satellites are being manifested. We are effectively under a global trade embargo. Revenue flow is zero. Operational runway with current cash reserves in non-aligned banks is approximately two months.\"\n\n**Brenda Miller, VP of Communications:** (Pushing off a wall to stabilize her drift, her eyes scanning the scrolling data streams) \"The narrative assault is comprehensive, Madame President. We are tracking coordinated negative sentiment spikes across all major Western media platforms. The primary keywords are 'Tycoon', 'Bond Villain', and 'Terrorist'. However...\"\n\nShe taps her interface, and the holographic sphere shifts. The angry crowds are replaced by heat maps and network graphs.\n\n\"If we look closer, the fury is synthetic. Those 'mass demonstrations' in London and Paris? Drone counts show fewer than 5,000 attendees, mostly mobilized by political action committees funded indirectly by traditional energy lobbies. The social media outrage is largely bot-driven. And interestingly, we've detected a massive, clumsy algorithmic purge by the NSA. They are actively scrubbing pro-SLAM comments and shadow-banning any discussion about 'logistical efficiency' or ‘dream of the stars’. They aren't just attacking us; they are terrified their own population might start asking why we are the bad guys for offering a free ride.\"\n\nEverybody turned slowly toward Georges Reid waiting for his final decision. He took his tablet, made a move over it, and turned toward Brenda Miller.\n\n“Brenda I have sent you a Press Release, deliver it please.”\n\n**PRESS RELEASE: The Surrender**\n\n**Source:** *S.L.A.M. Corp - Global Wire* **Date:** *April 17, 204X (09:00 UTC)* **Sender:** *Brenda Miller, VP of Communications* **To:** *United Nations Secretariat / Global Media Outlets*\n\n**SUBJECT: STATEMENT REGARDING THE UNITED NATIONS SUMMONS**\n\nTo the General Assembly and the People of Earth,\n\nS.L.A.M.

Here Are the 10 Stocks for 2026.\n\nBy  Paul R. La Monica\n\nUpdated Dec 29, 2025 4:53 pm EST / Original Dec 29, 2025 1:56 pm EST\n\nIt’s been a good year to be a Dog of the Dow—especially for dividend investors. The ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up an average of 17.8% in 2025 through Friday, Dec. 26, beating the Dow 30’s 14.5% gain.\n\nHealthcare giants Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson, as well as old tech leaders IBM and Cisco, helped push the Dogs of the Dow higher. These four stocks are up between 28% and 44% this year.\n\nThe remaining Dogs also delivered solid returns. In fact, only one— Procter &amp; Gamble —is on track to end 2025 in the red. According to research from Bespoke Investment Group, the ten Dogs of the Dow are on track to notch their best year on an equal-weighted basis since 2019.\n\nDividend-paying stocks, particularly ones with above-average yields, could continue to outperform in 2026, especially if the Federal Reserve keeps lowering interest rates next year. Long-term bond yields have tumbled from a year-to-date high of around 4.8% for the 10-year U.S. Treasury in early January to about 4.1% currently. If bond yields fall further, investors may flock to dividend-paying stocks for income.\n\nThe lineup is likely to change next year. Based on current dividend yields, IBM and Cisco would no longer be Dow dogs, mainly because of how well their stocks did in 2025, which puts downward pressure on their dividend yields. That’s obviously not a bad thing. And both stocks still yield more than 2%. McDonald’s would also be out of the club.\n\nThose three stocks would be replaced by a trio of underperformers this year: Nike , UnitedHealth, and Home Depot. But Wall Street is betting on a comeback for these Dow laggards. According to FactSet, the 12-month consensus price targets for Nike, UnitedHealth and Home Depot call for an average increase of 21% from their current levels.\n\nThe other seven Dogs of the Dow—Amgen and J&amp;J plus Verizon, Chevron, Merck, Coca-Cola and P&amp;G—would remain Dow dogs. Verizon and Chevron pay the biggest yields by far of this group: 6.7% and 4.6%, respectively. Verizon in particular looks attractive since it remains relatively cheap too, trading at just 8.5 times 2026 earnings estimates.\n\nMeet the 2026 Dogs of the Dow\n\nThese 10 stocks have the highest dividend yields in the Dow Jones Industrial Average\n\nCompany / Ticker\tDividend Yield\n\nVerizon Communications / VZ\t6.73%\n\nChevron Corporation / CVX\t4.56\n\nMerck / MRK\t3.03\n\nProcter &amp; Gamble / PG\t2.89\n\nCoca-Cola / KO\t2.88\n\nAmgen / AMGN\t2.86\n\nNike / NKE\t2.63\n\nHome Depot / HD\t2.62\n\nUnitedHealth Group / UNH\t2.60\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson / JNJ\t2.48\n\nNote: Data as of Dec. 26\n\nSources: Dow Jones Market Data, FactSet\n\nThe eight other Dogs of the Dow have yields ranging from 2.5% to 3%. Among that group, Amgen, Merck and J&amp;J could continue to rally thanks to the recent rebound for healthcare stocks as concerns about tough regulatory changes from Washington fade and earnings and revenue growth begin to accelerate.\n\nBut while the Dogs of the Dow have been winners this year, it’s worth noting that their track record is inconsistent at best over the past few years. The Dogs lagged the Dow 30 in 2023 and 2024. They did post a slight gain in 2022, a year when the broader market fell due to worries about inflation and a series of interest rate hikes by the Fed.\n\nWhat’s more, dividend stocks broadly have underperformed this year. The State Street SPDR S&amp;P Dividend exchange-traded fund is up just 6% in 2025 while the State Street SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 High Dividend ETF is flat. Sectors known for particularly large dividends, such as utilities, real estate and consumer staples, have been laggards too.\n\nStill, investors in the Dogs of the Dow can take comfort in the fact that these ten pooches pay reliable—and often very large—dividends. That should help provide steady income at a time when bond yields could head lower next year. That mix of proven income and potential rebound plays could keep the Dogs competitive in 2026—even if their bite isn’t quite as strong as it was this year.\n\nFin\n\nArticle link:\n\n https://www.barrons.com/articles/dogs-of-the-dow-dividend-stocks-2026-0071269e ", "url": "https://i.redd.it/0rkjvvmxw9ag1.jpeg", "score": 4, "num_comments": 0}}

Si no es apropiado, por favor retirad el post.\n\nAdemás, soy consciente de que hay muchísima desinformación sobre lo que es vivir en Estados Unidos. Dia si y dia también amigos/conocidos de España me dicen \"ya pero en Estados Unidos todo es más caro\", o el mítico \"Bueno pero si tienes que ir al hospital te arruinas\". No todo es más caro, y tengo un seguro que me paga la empresa por si me pasa algo (tanto de enfermedad, como de discapacidad).\n\nPor dar más contexto de mi situación, tengo 25 años, empecé mis estudios en la Poli de Madrid, y con 23 años me vine a EEUU a re-empezar y terminar la carrera aquí en California, ingeniería informática. Me gradúo de la Universidad en Mayo de 2026, pero ya estoy trabajando a tiempo completo/indefinido en una multinacional tecnológica que todos conocéis, como ingeniero de Software.\n\nHago este post muy inspirado en el de r/[paccount4283](https://www.reddit.com/user/paccount4283/) : [https://www.reddit.com/r/SpainFIRE/comments/1pw04dv/presupuesto\\_de\\_2025/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpainFIRE/comments/1pw04dv/presupuesto_de_2025/)\n\nMe pareció guay poder compartir con vosotros de forma realista en qué me gasto el dinero.\n\nAclaraciones:\n\n* La comida en la empresa de mi chica es gratis, asi que muchos días como con ella y eso que me ahorro (lo hago más por la comodidad que por ahorrar dinero, además la comida está muy buena).\n* El 401k de mi empresa no require que yo contribuya de ninguna manera. Ellos meten un 5% adicional de mi salario de forma anual, independientemente de si yo contribuyo o no.\n* El seguro médico lo paga mi empresa, y tiene unos copagos de $50 por visita a especialista, y $100 por visita a urgencias. Tiene un OOP-max (Out of Pocket Max, lo máximo que voy a gastar en sanidad en un año) de $3500. Es decir, que si (Dios no lo quiera) me pongo muy enfermo, o me tienen que operar o cualquier cosa, lo máximo que saldrá de mi bolsillo son $3500. Además me meten $1000 al año en una HSA, que es dinero que puedo gastar para cualquier cosa sanitaria, sin que tenga que salir de mi bolsillo.\n* En mi empresa nos cargan el coche gratis, así que no gasto mucho dinero en cargar mi coche).\n* Este 2026 me quiero sacar la licencia de piloto privado. Tengo la inmensa suerte de que  mi chica en sus ratos libres es profesora de aviación y tiene su avioncito, asi que me da clases gratis. Sólo pago los costes administrativos y el alquiler de otra avioneta para practicar (ella no me presta la suya jajja).\n* Mi alquiler incluye agua, luz y gas.\n\nSé que gasto demasiado dinero en chorradas, y que podría ahorrar más, pero bueno, sólo se vive una vez.\n\nComo dije, este post simplemente es por poner un data point sobre cómo nos gestionamos algunos de los españoles que estamos en el exilio jajaja \n\nObviamente si tenéis cualquier pregunta estaré encantado de responderla.

You can see the full details on our[ ](https://faq.wiimhome.com/en/support/solutions/articles/72000635113-wiim-ultra-roadmap)Help Center ([Ultra](https://faq.wiimhome.com/en/support/solutions/articles/72000635113-wiim-ultra-roadmap)|[ Amp Ultra](https://faq.wiimhome.com/en/support/solutions/articles/72000650112-wiim-amp-ultra-roadmap)), but here are some highlights and a quick look at where we're headed.\n\n\n\n# What This Roadmap Represents\n\nThis is a transparent look at what we're actively building, what we're exploring, and what we've recently shipped. Some of these features will land exactly as described. Others might evolve as we work through technical realities and a few might not make it at all. You’ll also notice that there are no timelines, development is a long process and priorities shift throughout the year, so we’re not going to commit to specific timing right now.\n\nWe're sharing this openly because your feedback directly shapes our priorities. We watch all the forum conversations, app surveys, and feature requests you share, and use it all to feed into this. So check it out, and we hope there’s something in here you love the idea of!\n\nThese roadmaps focus on the Ultra and Amp Ultra first. They're our flagship devices with the hardware to support more advanced features. Where it makes sense and where it's technically feasible, we'll bring capabilities to other products in the lineup.

Completely rewritten USB media engine.\n\n# Your Suggestions!\n\nThe roadmaps are a starting point. We're watching your responses, reading the threads, and paying attention to what resonates. If there's a feature you're interested in, say so. If something doesn't make sense for your use case, let us know, but be respectful. Not every feature is going to hit for every person, a feature you’ll never use might be exactly what someone else needs.\n\nWe're building this with you, not for you. The difference matters.\n\nCheck out the full roadmaps ([Ultra](https://faq.wiimhome.com/en/support/solutions/articles/72000635113-wiim-ultra-roadmap) |[ Amp Ultra](https://faq.wiimhome.com/en/support/solutions/articles/72000650112-wiim-amp-ultra-roadmap)) and feel free to jump into the comments to share!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WiiMHome/comments/1q2aal7/updated_wiim_ultra_and_amp_ultra_roadmap_are_here/", "score": 4, "num_comments": 2}}

Between finding[ more articles](https://nypost.com/2019/07/31/another-dog-dies-after-mri-at-long-island-vet-owner-claims/) and discovering things like they're private equity owned I researched the below and am interested on if this makes sense. I do want tips on how I can avoid becoming victim of another private equity owned vet though.\n\nI’m seeing some comments here trying to downplay the issues at LIVS by saying \"all vets get sued\" or \"people are just emotional.\" That is technically true, but it misses the point completely.\n\nI dug into legal filings, annual reports, and corporate records going back about ten years to compare LIVS to the Animal Medical Center (AMC) in NYC. When you actually look at the volume of patients vs. the *type* of lawsuits, a really ugly pattern shows up at LIVS that simply does not exist at AMC.\n\n**The Data: Volume vs. Allegations**\n\nFirst, you have to understand the scale difference. AMC is the \"Amazon\" of veterinary hospitals. They are massive. LIVS is a large specialty center, but they are significantly smaller.\n\n| |**Animal Medical Center (AMC)**|**Long Island Veterinary Specialists (LIVS)**|**Sources**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Annual Caseload|54,417 visits (2023 Verified)|\\~15,000 visits (Est. based on staff/facility ratio)|[AMC 2023 Impact Report](https://www.amcny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AMC_AnnualReport2023_072904_Issuu-final-edited-1.pdf); LIVS volume est. \\~25% of AMC based on facility size.|\n|Staff Size|140+ Veterinarians|**\\~**30–40 Veterinarians|[AMC \"About Us \"](https://www.amcny.org/meet-amc/about-us/)vs. [LIVS \"Careers\" Page](https://www.livs.org/careers).|\n|Ownership|Non-Profit / Teaching Hospital|**Private Equity** (NVA/Compassion-First)|[AMC Non-Profit Status](https://www.amcny.org/); [Compassion-First Acquisition](https://www.sgep.com/company/long-island-veterinary-specialists).|\n|Primary Lawsuit Type|Negligence, Slip-and-Fall, Employment|**Systemic Fraud, Unnecessary Surgery, \"Upselling\"**|See breakdown below.|\n\n**The Volume Mismatch (Why this matters)**\n\nIf complaints were simply a result of \"doing business,\" AMC should have 300% to 400% more fraud complaints than LIVS because they treat four times as many animals. They do not.\n\n* AMC Lawsuits are often operational. Someone slipped on a ramp, or a doctor made a specific mistake.\n* LIVS Lawsuits differ fundamentally. They aren't alleging \"mistakes.\" They are alleging intentional deception. The complaints consistently claim that doctors are fabricating diagnoses to force owners into unnecessary $10,000 procedures.\n* The Lawsuit Comparison\n\nI dug into the court dockets to find specific examples. The pattern holds up: AMC gets sued like a corporation (HR, accidents), while LIVS gets sued like a business trying to maximize revenue.\n\nAMC: \"Big Company Problems\"\n\n* *Rodrigues v. Animal Medical Center* (2020): A premises liability suit where a woman tripped on a ramp. Standard insurance claim.\n* *Chiaramonte v. The Animal Medical Center* (2014): An Equal Pay Act/HR dispute.\n* *Gale v. Animal Medical Center* (2013): A malpractice suit where the plaintiff *tried* to claim fraud. Outcome: The court dismissed the fraud claim but allowed the malpractice claim to proceed.\n* *Takeaway:* Even when people try to sue AMC for fraud, courts usually say \"No, this looks like a medical mistake, not a scam.\"\n\nLIVS: \"The Money Grab\"\n\n* *Lehr v. Long Island Veterinary Specialists* (The \"Oscar\" Case): The plaintiff alleged his dog had simple arthritis, but LIVS staff physically forced the dog into an MRI machine to bill for the scan, paralyzing the animal. They then tried to sell him spinal surgery to fix the injury they caused. This is an allegation of racketeering/upselling.\n* *Zabary v. Long Island Veterinary Specialists* (2019): A small claims suit regarding overpayment and billing.\n* *Adesso v. Long Island Veterinary Specialists* (2014): A suit demanding a refund after a cat died, claiming services weren't rendered.\n* *Takeaway:* These suits are consistently about transactions: refunds, overpayment, unnecessary procedures, and fraud.\n* The \"Business Model\" Problem\n\n**The root of this might be the ownership structure.**\n\n* AMC is a Non-Profit: It's a teaching hospital. Doctors are typically salaried or on academic tenure. There are no shareholders demanding quarterly growth.\n* LIVS is Private Equity: LIVS was acquired by Compassion-First, which was later absorbed by NVA (National Veterinary Associates). In this model, \"revenue leakage\" is the enemy. This incentivizes a culture where conservative treatment (rest and meds) is discouraged in favor of the \"Gold Standard\" workup (MRI + Surgery).\n\n**Does LIVS do \"more\" fraud? The data says yes.**\n\nLIVS has a specific, recurring pattern of allegations that AMC simply doesn't have: The prioritization of profit over medical necessity. AMC makes mistakes characteristic of a giant hospital. LIVS faces accusations characteristic of a predatory business. The lower patient volume at LIVS combined with the higher intensity of \"fraud\" accusations strongly suggests that unnecessary procedures are a feature, not a bug, of their operation.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/y0ni11tx00bg1.png", "score": 23, "num_comments": 2}}

There were 1,046 individual nominations, with 344 unique titles added to this year's list. [Here is the nominations thread in case you missed it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyromance/comments/1pb9yl3/share_your_top_10_alltime_favorite_series_for_the/?share_id=NGeyhsJXd6ktcsgt3mG5L&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1)\n\nBooks and series are ranked according to the number of nominations they received, but all nominations were included in the final list, so there are some popular favorites as well as many under-the-radar gems to discover. \n\nThis is the third edition of the Top Books List. Previous years’ Top Books lists are available here:\n\n* [r/FantasyRomance Top Books List 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyromance/comments/1hz2omi/rfantasyromance_top_books_list_second_edition/?share_id=UEd7UoNNBbE98pSJdfZfT&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1)\n* [r/FantasyRomance Top Books List 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyromance/comments/18uotfd/the_first_official_rfantasyromance_top_books_list/?share_id=bLExfpUWEIO1-wK4bvip9&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1)\n\nA quick summary and some recognitions:\n\n* **Villains and Virtues by A. K. Caggiano (#1)** has knocked **A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas (#2)** off the top spot! Sarah J. Maas still dominates with two of her series in the top 5, and all three of her series in the top 30. \n* Sarah J. Maas still has the most total nominations with 72 votes. Check out the pinned comment to see the top 25 authors with the most total nominations.\n* The best new addition to the list was **The Stonewater Kingdom by Rachel Gillig (#17)**. Other top new additions were **Wolf King by Lauren Palphreyman (#20)**, **Alchemised by SenLinYu (#22)**, and **The Everlasting by Alix E. Harrow (#23)**.\n\nWe weren’t able to run all rank changes this year because we don’t have access to last year’s data, but hopefully rank changes will be back next year!\n\nIn the next few weeks, we’re going to run a survey to put together a guide for the top books on this list that will hopefully provide the community with more information about the books. So please keep out on the look out for that!\n\nIf you’re interested, please also check out [Top Lists Wiki Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyromance/wiki/index/recommendations/top_lists/) for links to monthly and yearly romance bot data, the Readers’ Choice Awards, “worst” books list, and character polls.\n\nHere is the full list!

The physical world is not dependent on individual minds; rather, individual minds are localized perspectives within a single conscious field that manifests a law-governed experiential domain.\n\nKey claim:\n\nPhysical reality is not fundamental substance but a stable, rule-constrained experiential structure—analogous to a dream—generated by consciousness.\n\nThis “dream” metaphor is structural, not psychological. It denotes ontological dependence, not unreliability.\n\n\n\n1. Structure of Reality: Levels Without Finality\n\nThe model proposes layered ontology without a terminal ground:\n\n\t•\tLevel 1: Physical reality\nA causally closed, law-governed domain experienced by embodied agents. Time, causality, identity, and limitation operate here.\n\n\t•\tLevel 2: A single, unified consciousness\nThis consciousness is not an agent, planner, or moral authority. It does not act on the world; the world is its expression.\n\n\t•\tLevel 3+: Deeper generative conditions\nConsciousness itself is not ultimate. There may exist:\n\n\t•\tmultiple consciousnesses,\n\t•\tor meta-conditions that generate consciousness,\n\t•\tor recursive layers beyond conceptual access.\n\nCrucially, no level is declared final. The ontology is explicitly open-ended, accepting infinite regress rather than positing an absolute terminus (God, Being, or Necessity).\n\nThis is a deliberate rejection of:\n\n\t•\tclassical theism,\n\n\t•\tSpinozist monism with final substance,\n\n\t•\tHegelian absolute idealism.\n\n\n\n2. Time and Change: Appearance, Not Absolute Process\n\nTime exists only within the physical (dream) layer.\n\nFrom the absolute or meta-ontological standpoint:\n\n\t•\tthere is no before/after,\n\n\t•\tno growth,\n\n\t•\tno development,\n\n\t•\tno learning.\n\nAccordingly:\n\n\t•\t“accumulation of intellect”\n\n\t•\t“growth into godhood”\n\n\t•\t“eventual realization”\n\nare phenomenological appearances, not metaphysical processes.\n\nThey describe how existence feels from within time-bound perspectives, not what occurs at the absolute level.\n\nThus:\n\nAll change is perspectival; the underlying reality is static in the strongest sense—not frozen, but non-temporal.\n\nThis aligns with eternalism, but without physicalist commitments.\n\n\n\n3. Identity and Individuality\n\nIndividual selves are not substances. They are:\n\n\t•\tperspectival constraints,\n\n\t•\tlocalized informational bottlenecks,\n\n\t•\tnarrative centers within the dream.\n\nThey are necessary for:\n\n\t•\tdifferentiation,\n\n\t•\tfinite viewpoints,\n\n\t•\tdivergence of experiential structure.\n\nMemory loss, ego boundaries, and mortality are not flaws but structural requirements. If total awareness were accessible within life, individuality would collapse, eliminating experience altogether.\n\nThus:\n\nLimitation is not a defect of reality but the condition of its intelligibility.\n\n\n\n4. Laws of Nature: Why Rules Cannot Be Broken\n\nThe physical laws are non-negotiable from within the system.\n\nNot because:\n\n\t•\ta deity enforces them,\n\n\t•\tor morality demands them,\n\nbut because:\n\n\t•\twithout rigid constraints, coherent experience is impossible.\n\nLocal agency exists within the laws (choice, intention, action), but not over the laws. This explains:\n\n\t•\twhy “manifestation” appears to work probabilistically,\n\n\t•\twhy intention can bias outcomes,\n\n\t•\tbut why miracles and rule-violations do not occur at will.\n\nControl is navigational, not fundamental.\n\n\n\n5. Death and Reintegration\n\nDeath is not survival of the individual, nor reward or punishment.\n\nRather:\n\n\t•\tthe perspectival constraint dissolves,\n\n\t•\tthe localized narrative ends,\n\n\t•\tthe experience is already part of the total field.\n\nThere is no enduring personal identity beyond death. Continuity exists only at the level of consciousness as category, not as self.\n\nThis avoids:\n\n\t•\treincarnation doctrines that preserve ego,\n\n\t•\tannihilationism,\n\n\t•\tmoral accounting systems.\n\n\n\n6. No Teleology, No Cosmic Purpose\n\nThe model is explicitly non-teleological.\n\nThere is:\n\n\t•\tno goal,\n\n\t•\tno cosmic plan,\n\n\t•\tno optimization,\n\n\t•\tno moral arc.\n\nMeaning, purpose, and narrative coherence are:\n\n\t•\tevolved cognitive tools,\n\n\t•\tsurvival-oriented projections,\n\n\t•\tlocally necessary but globally illusory.\n\nThis distinguishes the view from:\n\n\t•\tspiritual progress models,\n\n\t•\tkarmic systems,\n\n\t•\tdevelopmental theologies.\n\nReality does not unfold toward anything.\nIt simply unfolds.\n\n\n\n7. The Multiverse Reinterpreted\n\n“Parallel realities” are not:\n\n\t•\tbranching timelines,\n\n\t•\tshared law-spaces,\n\n\t•\tquantum bifurcations.\n\nThey are entirely separate dream-realities, potentially generated by different consciousnesses or different generative conditions.\n\nThere is no requirement that:\n\n\t•\tthey share physics,\n\n\t•\tthey be accessible,\n\n\t•\tor that they relate structurally to ours.\n\nThus the multiverse here is metaphysical pluralism, not physical cosmology.\n\n\n\n8. The Void and the Final Limit of Explanation\n\nThe “void” is not nothingness in the strict sense.\n\nIt is:\n\t•\tabsence of structure,\n\n\t•\tabsence of law,\n\n\t•\tabsence of determinate being.\n\nYet it is generative.\n\nThis creates an unavoidable boundary:\n\nWhy is there anything at all?\n\nThe model does not answer this. It explicitly stops here.\n\nAt the deepest level, one of the following must hold:\n\n\t1.\tExistence is brute\n\n\t2.\tExistence is necessary\n\n\t3.\tExistence is self-justifying\n\n\t4.\tExistence is accidental\n\nThe model does not privilege any option. This is not an oversight; it is a refusal to feign knowledge.\n\n\n\n9. Ethical Implications (or Lack Thereof)\n\nThe ontology itself is ethically neutral.\n\nIt does not justify:\n\n\t•\tsuffering,\n\n\t•\tcruelty,\n\n\t•\tindifference.\n\nNor does it ground:\n\n\t•\tmoral realism,\n\n\t•\tuniversal obligation.\n\nEthics remain local human constructs, justified pragmatically:\n\n\t•\tsuffering hurts,\n\n\t•\tcompassion reduces harm,\n\n\t•\tcooperation stabilizes systems.\n\nThis is a feature, not a bug.\n\n\n\n10. Classification and Final Assessment\n\nThis model can be classified as:\n\n\t•\tNon-dual idealism\n\n\t•\tEternalist, non-teleological metaphysics\n\n\t•\tRecursive, non-foundational ontology\n\n\t•\tAnti-theistic but not atheistic\n\n\t•\tMetaphysically minimalist yet conceptually deep\n\nIt is:\n\n\t•\tinternally coherent,\n\n\t•\tresistant to naive critique,\n\n\t•\thonest about its limits.\n\nIt is not:\n\n•\tprovable,\n\n•\tfalsifiable,\n\n•\tmorally directive,\n\n•\texistentially comforting.\n\nReality is a rule-bound experiential domain generated by consciousness, which itself arises from deeper generative conditions without a final foundation.\nIndividual selves are perspectival constraints necessary for differentiation.\nTime, growth, and purpose are internal appearances, not absolute features.\nThere is no ultimate explanation—only successive horizons of intelligibility.\n\nAt this point, philosophy does not advance by adding more structure, but by recognizing where language, explanation, and cognition reach their limit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nonduality/comments/1q2a7le/a_speculative_nonteleological_idealist_ontology/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 2}}

A few days ago part of this conversation previously unknown to me was brought to my attention, viz. the paper (if it is that), “[AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/).” I’m not sure if this can be called a paper properly speaking; it’s more like a fictional scenario, but the authors take pains to point out that there is a great deal of research behind their scenario. (There’s a [half hour explanatory Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KVDDfAkRgc) about it with more than nine million views, which is a good indication of the impact this scenario has already had.) AI 2027 appeared this year. Max Tegmark’s book *Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence* (I mentioned this in a footnote to [newsletter 356](https://mailchi.mp/1b22042bb877/the-view-from-oregon-356)) appeared in 2017, and it too included a fictional near-future scenario of the appearance of artificial superintelligence (ASI). (Another fictional portrayal of ASI is in the third season of Westworld, in which the ASI is called Rehoboam, though this is made to serve the interests of the story and isn’t intended to make a point about ASI.) I find it interesting, and perhaps significant, that both Tegmark’s book and AI 2027 choose to cast a superintelligence scenario in fictional terms. It seems that fiction communicates the urgency the writers want to express better than a traditional scientific paper. It would be interesting to inquire why that is. (If we’re going to talk about ASI in terms of fictional scenarios, why don’t we discuss the James P. Hogan novel *The Two Faces of Tomorrow* or the aforementioned Westworld season?)\n\nBoth the AI 2027 scenario and Tegmark’s scenario start with machines that are specialized in coding, because this has an immediate connection to recursive self-improvement. A machine that could improve its own code could produce more advanced iterations of itself, but there is little intrinsic relationship between coding and other cognitive tasks that a machine might take over. There are many examples of this. A simple pocket calculator can outperform any human mathematician in adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, being both faster and more accurate. Contemporary chess programs can outperform chess grandmasters, and the best Go players have been beaten by computers, but the programs that do this can’t do anything else, just like a pocket calculator can’t do anything but a handful of arithmetical functions. To observe that specialization in one area of cognition does not necessarily translate into competence in another area of cognition immediately suggests the question of how tightly compartmentalized any form of cognition is or can be, and this in turn suggests the modularity of mind hypothesis.\n\nEarlier this year when I did a lot of reading in psychology (I was helping a friend teach a class in psychology by giving guest lectures) I got deeper into the modularity of mind than I had previously and I came to appreciate its connections with Aristotelian philosophy of mind and Freudian psychoanalysis. Previously I had been skeptical, but my skepticism was primarily a function of my having encountered vulgarized versions of the modularity of mind; Fodor’s original book is quite good and quite reasonable, and not something radically new (as I just noted, it is continuous with themes in Aristotle and Freud) that can’t be assimilated to the long tradition of philosophy of mind. But modularity of mind became so popular for a time that it was treated as gospel and I always find this sort of thing repellent. I’ve read books and papers that refer to it as though it were the only conception of the mind on offer, and this isn’t going to help anyone understand the problems that a philosophy of mind is trying to solve and what other theories have had to say about these problems. \n\nIn any case, the question of the compartmentalization of cognitive skills is immediately posed by AI/AGI/ASI scenarios based on optimizing coding skills and assuming that a superhuman coder is going to drag all other competencies along with its coding competency to the point that the inevitable result is a machine, “eclipsing all humans at all tasks” (in the language of the AI 2027 scenario) or “capabilities… far beyond human” (in the language of Tegmark’s scenario). If this is what’s expected from ASI coders, is this what we find with the best human coders? I don’t think it’s unfair to ask whether the best human coders exemplify the virtues of renaissance men, not only turning their hand to any task, but excelling beyond others when they do so, being essentially Nietzschean supermen walking among us, and I don’t think this is generally observed to be the case. What one often finds is that the world entire is interpreted through the lens of computer programming, as the early modern miller Menocchio framed his cosmology in terms of cheese and worms (cf. the PS to [newsletter 370](https://mailchi.mp/a40fab3210d4/the-view-from-oregon-370)), seeing the world entire through the lens of his profession. One sad truth that we all eventually learn that is a great deal of human cognition is opaque to itself more often than not. An individual can be a brilliant physician or engineer, but be completely incapable of bringing this brilliance to other areas of their life, including framing a conception of the world entire.\n\nThe [AI Futures project](https://ai-futures.org/) responsible for [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) has issued a [statement](https://superintelligence-statement.org/), admirably kept to a single sentence, which is this:\n\n&gt;We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is\n\n&gt;1.      broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and\n\n&gt;2.      strong public buy-in.\n\nWhile it’s admirable that they’ve been able to keep their recommendation to a single sentence, this has got to be one of the most ludicrous proposals for stifling scientific research that I’ve seen. Apart from the obvious problems in attempting to enforce any kind of ban on research, there is the equally obvious problem of drawing a distinction between ASI research and AGI research or, for that matter, any computer research whatever. I would call this a particularly egregious form of “maxipok creep.” [Nick Bostrom formulated the maxipok rule](https://existential-risk.com/concept.pdf) such that: “Maximise the probability of an ‘OK outcome’, where an OK outcome is any outcome that avoids existential catastrophe.” This sounds reasonable enough, but the interpretation of it tends to creep until we’ve painted ourselves into a risk-averse corner from which we have no way out. If building big, fast computers is interpreted as a potential existential catastrophe, then our future “OK outcome” will be humble indeed.  \n\nThe trivial argument to make here would be to argue that banning ASI research is a slippery slope precisely because a clean distinction can’t be made between ASI and AGI, and between AGI and any computer research whatsoever, such that a ban on ASI research would ultimately and eventually mean a ban on any computer research at all, which would either make us Luddites or fools, since stopping all computer research would mean an end to any futher development in computing, while knowing that we needed to stop all computer research or risk everything and still failing to do so would mean our doom. I call this a trivial argument because we could set limits, however imperfectly, and we could establish conventions that would allow us to distinguish between computer science *simpliciter* on the one hand, and, on the other hand, AI, AGI, and ASI. The distinction need not be a crisp, clear demarcation; it only needs to be close enough to get the job done. \n\nThe substantive objection is that those who talk about AI, AGI, and ASI don’t really know what they’re talking about. Here we run into a problem that is neither technological nor philosophical, but sociological, or, if you prefer, spiritual. One must be careful to not appear dismissive, since those who define themselves through the identification of such risks will point to your failure to share their judgment as to what constitutes a risk as a sign of *your* failure to understand. Part of the difficulty in discussing AI, AGI, and ASI risk is that the idea has so taken over the discussion of existential risk that this one concern has crowded out almost everything else. Those researching this risk would likely argue that this is due to the very real risk that the technology involves, and not to any social contagion. But having existential risk research turn into a bandwagon that everyone jumps on, or everyone feels the obligation to jump on for fear of being left behind (or, perhaps more to the point, for fear of losing their funding), furnishes the social proof that all human beings desire, but also ironically itself constitutes an existential risk. If a society has a community of persons tasked with assessing and mitigating risks, and this entire community focuses on, say, insect infestations, one might see this as a comparatively trivial preoccupation that is consuming social resources that are supposed to be devoted to non-trivial risks.\n\nI propose another way forward. I suggest that we ought to make an effort—not coupled with any ban on scientific research, but in parallel with research that is going to happen anyway, like it or not—to clarify our concepts in regard to AI, AGI, and ASI, so that we know ourselves to be talking about the same things if regulation should ever prove to be necessary. I can imagine something like the [International Commision on Stratigraphy (ICS)](https://stratigraphy.org/) that formulates and regulates the geological time scale, setting standards for naming and re-naming subdivisions of geological time, or the [*Bureau international des poids et mesures (BIPM)*](https://www.bipm.org/en/) that maintains the standards of the metric system. We could have an International Commission on Cognition (ICC, not to be confused with the International Criminal Court or the Interstate Commerce Commission) that defines key terms for AI/AGI/ASI research.\n\nThe rub is that this can’t be a purely scientific undertaking. Defining the terms related to AI, AGI/ASI would be a task deeply enmeshed with philosophy of mind. Fortunately, we wouldn’t have to agree on any metaphysical conception of the mind. We merely need to have a common language (ideally, a formalizable language that can be integrated seamlessly into the formalizations of the natural sciences) in which to discuss the mind. That are many areas of human life that are deeply enmeshed with traditional philosophical problems—it was, after all, human life that suggested these philosophical problems—and we nevertheless find a way of going on about the business of life without having agreed beforehand on any overarching metaphysical framework. We could do this with mind also, though the challenges are greater, because, even setting aside metaphysical disagreements, merely agreeing on the concepts to be employed in the description of cognition is controversial.   \n\nThat the ASI community is trying to match three pounds of homegrown wetware powered by pizza and hamburgers with acres of data centers and billions of dollars ought to be your first clue that something doesn’t quite add up. It’s somewhat like the race to build a marine chronometer, which was pursued with large mechanisms for many years, until John Harrison built a marine chronometer about the side of a large pocketwatch. It would be not only an ironic outcome, but a real existential threat you could say, if any prohibitions on the development of ASI ended up crippling an industry even while other and more imaginative researchers ended up producing ASI in their garage by formalizing and mechanizing the actual processes of human thought rather than mimicking them on a grand scale.   \n\nBest wishes,\n\nNick\n\nPS—Last week I asked the question, “Is origins of life an intrinsically planetary-scale process?” and I suggested some mechanisms that point to this being the case. I’ve just realized that an important distinction needs to be emphasized throughout any such discussion, a distinction between boundary conditions and specific mechanisms. The specific mechanisms that result in the origins of life may not involve the boundary conditions that made it possible for the specific mechanisms to produce life, and certainly it won’t involve *all* the boundary conditions. It may be the case that the entirety of the universe is the boundary condition for life to arise on Earth, but the mechanisms on Earth that resulted in the origins of life don’t need to invoke the origins of the universe, which are among the boundary conditions for life.  \n\nWhen positing an unfamiliar idea (I haven’t heard anyone else ask, “Is origins of life an intrinsically planetary-scale process?” so I assume that it’s at least somewhat unfamilar), one often has to go overboard in emphasizing the conditions and qualifications to which the idea is subject, which has the consequence of muddying the exposition. Since an unfamiliar idea shines best when its exposition is clean and uncluttered, the (obvious) conditions and qualifications are often passed over, which leaves what appears as a vulnerability that attracts trivial criticisms. This is probably a lot of what’s going on with the AI/AGI/ASI discussion.\n\n# Newsletter link:\n\n[https://mailchi.mp/35b5b0948371/the-view-from-oregon-373](https://mailchi.mp/35b5b0948371/the-view-from-oregon-373)\n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/The_View_from_Oregon/comments/1q2a6kx/artificial_superintelligence_slouches_towards/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0}}

Si no es apropiado, por favor retirad el post.\n\nAdemás, soy consciente de que hay muchísima desinformación sobre lo que es vivir en Estados Unidos. Dia si y dia también amigos/conocidos de España me dicen \"ya pero en Estados Unidos todo es más caro\", o el mítico \"Bueno pero si tienes que ir al hospital te arruinas\". No todo es más caro, y tengo un seguro que me paga la empresa por si me pasa algo (tanto de enfermedad, como de discapacidad).\n\nPor dar más contexto de mi situación, tengo 25 años, empecé mis estudios en la Poli de Madrid, y con 23 años me vine a EEUU a re-empezar y terminar la carrera aquí en California, ingeniería informática. Me gradúo de la Universidad en Mayo de 2026, pero ya estoy trabajando a tiempo completo/indefinido en una multinacional tecnológica que todos conocéis, como ingeniero de Software.\n\nHago este post muy inspirado en el de r/[paccount4283](https://www.reddit.com/user/paccount4283/) : [https://www.reddit.com/r/SpainFIRE/comments/1pw04dv/presupuesto\\_de\\_2025/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpainFIRE/comments/1pw04dv/presupuesto_de_2025/)\n\nMe pareció guay poder compartir con vosotros de forma realista en qué me gasto el dinero.\n\nAclaraciones:\n\n* La comida en la empresa de mi chica es gratis, asi que muchos días como con ella y eso que me ahorro (lo hago más por la comodidad que por ahorrar dinero, además la comida está muy buena).\n* El 401k de mi empresa no require que yo contribuya de ninguna manera. Ellos meten un 5% adicional de mi salario de forma anual, independientemente de si yo contribuyo o no.\n* El seguro médico lo paga mi empresa, y tiene unos copagos de $50 por visita a especialista, y $100 por visita a urgencias. Tiene un OOP-max (Out of Pocket Max, lo máximo que voy a gastar en sanidad en un año) de $3500. Es decir, que si (Dios no lo quiera) me pongo muy enfermo, o me tienen que operar o cualquier cosa, lo máximo que saldrá de mi bolsillo son $3500. Además me meten $1000 al año en una HSA, que es dinero que puedo gastar para cualquier cosa sanitaria, sin que tenga que salir de mi bolsillo.\n* En mi empresa nos cargan el coche gratis, así que no gasto mucho dinero en cargar mi coche).\n* Este 2026 me quiero sacar la licencia de piloto privado. Tengo la inmensa suerte de que  mi chica en sus ratos libres es profesora de aviación y tiene su avioncito, asi que me da clases gratis. Sólo pago los costes administrativos y el alquiler de otra avioneta para practicar (ella no me presta la suya jajja).\n* Mi alquiler incluye agua, luz y gas.\n\nSé que gasto demasiado dinero en chorradas, y que podría ahorrar más, pero bueno, sólo se vive una vez.\n\nComo dije, este post simplemente es por poner un data point sobre cómo nos gestionamos algunos de los españoles que estamos en el exilio jajaja \n\nObviamente si tenéis cualquier pregunta estaré encantado de responderla.

Some of these features will land exactly as described. Others might evolve as we work through technical realities and a few might not make it at all. You’ll also notice that there are no timelines, development is a long process and priorities shift throughout the year, so we’re not going to commit to specific timing right now.\n\nWe're sharing this openly because your feedback directly shapes our priorities. We watch all the forum conversations, app surveys, and feature requests you share, and use it all to feed into this. So check it out, and we hope there’s something in here you love the idea of!\n\nThese roadmaps focus on the Ultra and Amp Ultra first. They're our flagship devices with the hardware to support more advanced features. Where it makes sense and where it's technically feasible, we'll bring capabilities to other products in the lineup. Some features will be Ultra-specific by necessity.\n\n\n\n# What's Next\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqpdiqri10bg1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c87b7343914f57f42fa9d4400e8c71c7169bf6e\n\n**Display &amp; Interface Upgrades**\n\nInput-specific screen layouts that remember your preferences and automatically switch based on active input. Black background mode for album art that blends seamlessly with the bezel. Standby and clock options including permanent clock display during playback with adjustable timeout durations. Direct USB and Favorites browsing on the touchscreen without needing your phone.\n\n**Next-Generation Room Correction**\n\nBassFit integration automatically aligns time and level between your main speakers and subwoofer for seamless low-end coherence. SurroundFit calibration provides precise automated alignment of front, surround, and subwoofer channels for immersive experiences.

Walking along a giant dinosaur’s teeth as its mouth slowly closed around me.  All dreams I still remember to this day.\n\nI’ve been told to start keeping a dream journal but I haven’t found a need to.  I must have some form of photographic memory, but only for useless memories that never happened.  I don’t mind it.  Sometimes existing in those memories can be a brief escape from reality.\n\nThat’s what I thought for a long time at least.  I had a dream the other night that I can’t seem to shake.\n\nI was walking in the woods near my apartment.  A beautiful state park, along a Great Lake. I knew it well.  There are no roads through the park, just the parking lot at the south-end, a few miles from the highway. You’d leave your car there and start hiking North.  There were a few trails, one running perpendicular to the lake on the East side.  This is the trail I was on during my dream.  It was dark out and gently snowing, large heavy snowflakes.  Most of the trees barren of leaves, save for the few pinetrees that cast shadows across the path.  I could glance to my right and see the slow, rolling waves, lazily dying into the frost covered pebble beach.  It felt peaceful.  Everything was so familiar.  I walked for what felt like the entire night, following this path I knew so well, never growing tired, never questioning why I was here in the dead of night. An owl cooed somewhere to my left.  Small corn snakes slithered off the path in front of me as to not be stepped on, I thought I saw a kangaroo bounding somewhere along the beach.  I wish I could stay he--  Wait.  That doesn’t seem right.\n\nI abruptly stopped my calm stride and with it the forest stopped too.  No more distant owl, no more evergreens scratching their naked neighbors with their needles moved by the wind.  In fact there was no more wind.  It was as if the entire world stopped with me.  I didn’t dare move, as to not interrupt this sudden stillness.  Standing still for minutes on end, I waited for something to make a noise.  Anything. “Please, something move.  I can’t take this anymore.”  I thought to myself. In hindsight, I should have just pinched myself and been done with this strange dream.  But it felt wrong to interject.\n\n\n\nWhat felt like hours had passed when I caught a shadow in my peripheral.  Something down by the water.  “Thank God.”  I could finally move.  Using my new-found freedom I ducked under a fallen tree to try and get an eye on whatever had cast it..  Peering over the dead wood I saw the silhouette of the kangaroo on the beach.  It had felt so out of place before, but if it was, no one had told it. It walked on all 4s in a large circle, maybe 12 feet in diameter.  When it had completed its circle, it slowly hopped to the center and began to rise up, standing on its hind legs and raising its head.  It stared at the night sky and slowly opened its mouth releasing a bellowing howl.  I covered my ears, though it did almost nothing to block the noise.  Small birds fell from the trees, bouncing off the dead branches of the birch trees and softly hitting the ground with blood seeping from their heads.  The night sky darkened, one by one stars blinking out.  The howl continued, unwavering, as if a call to the heavens themselves.  When it finally stopped I lay on the frozen ground, hoping my hearing would return.  After a few minutes of silence and the ringing beginning to fade, I dared to look over the dead tree once more.  As my eyes peered over once more, I had to stifle a scream.  The kangaroo stood only a few feet from me, for the first time as not just a silhouette.  I could see its hairless face, with lidless black eyes.  Poorly scabbed legs, with thick wriggling earth-worms crawling from the unhealed wounds.  \n\n\n\nThe last thing I remember was the sweet smell that almost sizzled off its skin.  A smell of honey and mulberry.  A smell I will not soon forget.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q2a9eu/i_saw_a_kangaroo_in_my_dream/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2}}

Between finding[ more articles](https://nypost.com/2019/07/31/another-dog-dies-after-mri-at-long-island-vet-owner-claims/) and discovering things like they're private equity owned I researched the below and am interested on if this makes sense. I do want tips on how I can avoid becoming victim of another private equity owned vet though.\n\nI’m seeing some comments here trying to downplay the issues at LIVS by saying \"all vets get sued\" or \"people are just emotional.\" That is technically true, but it misses the point completely.\n\nI dug into legal filings, annual reports, and corporate records going back about ten years to compare LIVS to the Animal Medical Center (AMC) in NYC. When you actually look at the volume of patients vs. the *type* of lawsuits, a really ugly pattern shows up at LIVS that simply does not exist at AMC.\n\n**The Data: Volume vs. Allegations**\n\nFirst, you have to understand the scale difference. AMC is the \"Amazon\" of veterinary hospitals. They are massive. LIVS is a large specialty center, but they are significantly smaller.\n\n| |**Animal Medical Center (AMC)**|**Long Island Veterinary Specialists (LIVS)**|**Sources**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Annual Caseload|54,417 visits (2023 Verified)|\\~15,000 visits (Est. based on staff/facility ratio)|[AMC 2023 Impact Report](https://www.amcny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AMC_AnnualReport2023_072904_Issuu-final-edited-1.pdf); LIVS volume est. \\~25% of AMC based on facility size.|\n|Staff Size|140+ Veterinarians|**\\~**30–40 Veterinarians|[AMC \"About Us \"](https://www.amcny.org/meet-amc/about-us/)vs. [LIVS \"Careers\" Page](https://www.livs.org/careers).|\n|Ownership|Non-Profit / Teaching Hospital|**Private Equity** (NVA/Compassion-First)|[AMC Non-Profit Status](https://www.amcny.org/); [Compassion-First Acquisition](https://www.sgep.com/company/long-island-veterinary-specialists).|\n|Primary Lawsuit Type|Negligence, Slip-and-Fall, Employment|**Systemic Fraud, Unnecessary Surgery, \"Upselling\"**|See breakdown below.|\n\n**The Volume Mismatch (Why this matters)**\n\nIf complaints were simply a result of \"doing business,\" AMC should have 300% to 400% more fraud complaints than LIVS because they treat four times as many animals. They do not.\n\n* AMC Lawsuits are often operational. Someone slipped on a ramp, or a doctor made a specific mistake.\n* LIVS Lawsuits differ fundamentally. They aren't alleging \"mistakes.\" They are alleging intentional deception. The complaints consistently claim that doctors are fabricating diagnoses to force owners into unnecessary $10,000 procedures.\n* The Lawsuit Comparison\n\nI dug into the court dockets to find specific examples. The pattern holds up: AMC gets sued like a corporation (HR, accidents), while LIVS gets sued like a business trying to maximize revenue.\n\nAMC: \"Big Company Problems\"\n\n* *Rodrigues v. Animal Medical Center* (2020): A premises liability suit where a woman tripped on a ramp. Standard insurance claim.\n* *Chiaramonte v. The Animal Medical Center* (2014): An Equal Pay Act/HR dispute.\n* *Gale v. Animal Medical Center* (2013): A malpractice suit where the plaintiff *tried* to claim fraud. Outcome: The court dismissed the fraud claim but allowed the malpractice claim to proceed.\n* *Takeaway:* Even when people try to sue AMC for fraud, courts usually say \"No, this looks like a medical mistake, not a scam.\"\n\nLIVS: \"The Money Grab\"\n\n* *Lehr v. Long Island Veterinary Specialists* (The \"Oscar\" Case): The plaintiff alleged his dog had simple arthritis, but LIVS staff physically forced the dog into an MRI machine to bill for the scan, paralyzing the animal. They then tried to sell him spinal surgery to fix the injury they caused. This is an allegation of racketeering/upselling.\n* *Zabary v. Long Island Veterinary Specialists* (2019): A small claims suit regarding overpayment and billing.\n* *Adesso v. Long Island Veterinary Specialists* (2014): A suit demanding a refund after a cat died, claiming services weren't rendered.\n* *Takeaway:* These suits are consistently about transactions: refunds, overpayment, unnecessary procedures, and fraud.\n* The \"Business Model\" Problem\n\n**The root of this might be the ownership structure.**\n\n* AMC is a Non-Profit: It's a teaching hospital. Doctors are typically salaried or on academic tenure. There are no shareholders demanding quarterly growth.\n* LIVS is Private Equity: LIVS was acquired by Compassion-First, which was later absorbed by NVA (National Veterinary Associates). In this model, \"revenue leakage\" is the enemy. This incentivizes a culture where conservative treatment (rest and meds) is discouraged in favor of the \"Gold Standard\" workup (MRI + Surgery).\n\n**Does LIVS do \"more\" fraud? The data says yes.**\n\nLIVS has a specific, recurring pattern of allegations that AMC simply doesn't have: The prioritization of profit over medical necessity. AMC makes mistakes characteristic of a giant hospital. LIVS faces accusations characteristic of a predatory business. The lower patient volume at LIVS combined with the higher intensity of \"fraud\" accusations strongly suggests that unnecessary procedures are a feature, not a bug, of their operation.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/y0ni11tx00bg1.png", "score": 23, "num_comments": 2}}

A few days ago part of this conversation previously unknown to me was brought to my attention, viz. the paper (if it is that), “[AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/).” I’m not sure if this can be called a paper properly speaking; it’s more like a fictional scenario, but the authors take pains to point out that there is a great deal of research behind their scenario. (There’s a [half hour explanatory Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KVDDfAkRgc) about it with more than nine million views, which is a good indication of the impact this scenario has already had.) AI 2027 appeared this year. Max Tegmark’s book *Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence* (I mentioned this in a footnote to [newsletter 356](https://mailchi.mp/1b22042bb877/the-view-from-oregon-356)) appeared in 2017, and it too included a fictional near-future scenario of the appearance of artificial superintelligence (ASI). (Another fictional portrayal of ASI is in the third season of Westworld, in which the ASI is called Rehoboam, though this is made to serve the interests of the story and isn’t intended to make a point about ASI.) I find it interesting, and perhaps significant, that both Tegmark’s book and AI 2027 choose to cast a superintelligence scenario in fictional terms. It seems that fiction communicates the urgency the writers want to express better than a traditional scientific paper. It would be interesting to inquire why that is. (If we’re going to talk about ASI in terms of fictional scenarios, why don’t we discuss the James P. Hogan novel *The Two Faces of Tomorrow* or the aforementioned Westworld season?)\n\nBoth the AI 2027 scenario and Tegmark’s scenario start with machines that are specialized in coding, because this has an immediate connection to recursive self-improvement. A machine that could improve its own code could produce more advanced iterations of itself, but there is little intrinsic relationship between coding and other cognitive tasks that a machine might take over. There are many examples of this. A simple pocket calculator can outperform any human mathematician in adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, being both faster and more accurate. Contemporary chess programs can outperform chess grandmasters, and the best Go players have been beaten by computers, but the programs that do this can’t do anything else, just like a pocket calculator can’t do anything but a handful of arithmetical functions. To observe that specialization in one area of cognition does not necessarily translate into competence in another area of cognition immediately suggests the question of how tightly compartmentalized any form of cognition is or can be, and this in turn suggests the modularity of mind hypothesis.\n\nEarlier this year when I did a lot of reading in psychology (I was helping a friend teach a class in psychology by giving guest lectures) I got deeper into the modularity of mind than I had previously and I came to appreciate its connections with Aristotelian philosophy of mind and Freudian psychoanalysis. Previously I had been skeptical, but my skepticism was primarily a function of my having encountered vulgarized versions of the modularity of mind; Fodor’s original book is quite good and quite reasonable, and not something radically new (as I just noted, it is continuous with themes in Aristotle and Freud) that can’t be assimilated to the long tradition of philosophy of mind. But modularity of mind became so popular for a time that it was treated as gospel and I always find this sort of thing repellent. I’ve read books and papers that refer to it as though it were the only conception of the mind on offer, and this isn’t going to help anyone understand the problems that a philosophy of mind is trying to solve and what other theories have had to say about these problems. \n\nIn any case, the question of the compartmentalization of cognitive skills is immediately posed by AI/AGI/ASI scenarios based on optimizing coding skills and assuming that a superhuman coder is going to drag all other competencies along with its coding competency to the point that the inevitable result is a machine, “eclipsing all humans at all tasks” (in the language of the AI 2027 scenario) or “capabilities… far beyond human” (in the language of Tegmark’s scenario). If this is what’s expected from ASI coders, is this what we find with the best human coders? I don’t think it’s unfair to ask whether the best human coders exemplify the virtues of renaissance men, not only turning their hand to any task, but excelling beyond others when they do so, being essentially Nietzschean supermen walking among us, and I don’t think this is generally observed to be the case. What one often finds is that the world entire is interpreted through the lens of computer programming, as the early modern miller Menocchio framed his cosmology in terms of cheese and worms (cf. the PS to [newsletter 370](https://mailchi.mp/a40fab3210d4/the-view-from-oregon-370)), seeing the world entire through the lens of his profession. One sad truth that we all eventually learn that is a great deal of human cognition is opaque to itself more often than not. An individual can be a brilliant physician or engineer, but be completely incapable of bringing this brilliance to other areas of their life, including framing a conception of the world entire.\n\nThe [AI Futures project](https://ai-futures.org/) responsible for [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) has issued a [statement](https://superintelligence-statement.org/), admirably kept to a single sentence, which is this:\n\n&gt;We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is\n\n&gt;1.      broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and\n\n&gt;2.      strong public buy-in.\n\nWhile it’s admirable that they’ve been able to keep their recommendation to a single sentence, this has got to be one of the most ludicrous proposals for stifling scientific research that I’ve seen. Apart from the obvious problems in attempting to enforce any kind of ban on research, there is the equally obvious problem of drawing a distinction between ASI research and AGI research or, for that matter, any computer research whatever. I would call this a particularly egregious form of “maxipok creep.” [Nick Bostrom formulated the maxipok rule](https://existential-risk.com/concept.pdf) such that: “Maximise the probability of an ‘OK outcome’, where an OK outcome is any outcome that avoids existential catastrophe.” This sounds reasonable enough, but the interpretation of it tends to creep until we’ve painted ourselves into a risk-averse corner from which we have no way out. If building big, fast computers is interpreted as a potential existential catastrophe, then our future “OK outcome” will be humble indeed.  \n\nThe trivial argument to make here would be to argue that banning ASI research is a slippery slope precisely because a clean distinction can’t be made between ASI and AGI, and between AGI and any computer research whatsoever, such that a ban on ASI research would ultimately and eventually mean a ban on any computer research at all, which would either make us Luddites or fools, since stopping all computer research would mean an end to any futher development in computing, while knowing that we needed to stop all computer research or risk everything and still failing to do so would mean our doom. I call this a trivial argument because we could set limits, however imperfectly, and we could establish conventions that would allow us to distinguish between computer science *simpliciter* on the one hand, and, on the other hand, AI, AGI, and ASI. The distinction need not be a crisp, clear demarcation; it only needs to be close enough to get the job done. \n\nThe substantive objection is that those who talk about AI, AGI, and ASI don’t really know what they’re talking about. Here we run into a problem that is neither technological nor philosophical, but sociological, or, if you prefer, spiritual. One must be careful to not appear dismissive, since those who define themselves through the identification of such risks will point to your failure to share their judgment as to what constitutes a risk as a sign of *your* failure to understand. Part of the difficulty in discussing AI, AGI, and ASI risk is that the idea has so taken over the discussion of existential risk that this one concern has crowded out almost everything else. Those researching this risk would likely argue that this is due to the very real risk that the technology involves, and not to any social contagion. But having existential risk research turn into a bandwagon that everyone jumps on, or everyone feels the obligation to jump on for fear of being left behind (or, perhaps more to the point, for fear of losing their funding), furnishes the social proof that all human beings desire, but also ironically itself constitutes an existential risk. If a society has a community of persons tasked with assessing and mitigating risks, and this entire community focuses on, say, insect infestations, one might see this as a comparatively trivial preoccupation that is consuming social resources that are supposed to be devoted to non-trivial risks.\n\nI propose another way forward. I suggest that we ought to make an effort—not coupled with any ban on scientific research, but in parallel with research that is going to happen anyway, like it or not—to clarify our concepts in regard to AI, AGI, and ASI, so that we know ourselves to be talking about the same things if regulation should ever prove to be necessary. I can imagine something like the [International Commision on Stratigraphy (ICS)](https://stratigraphy.org/) that formulates and regulates the geological time scale, setting standards for naming and re-naming subdivisions of geological time, or the [*Bureau international des poids et mesures (BIPM)*](https://www.bipm.org/en/) that maintains the standards of the metric system. We could have an International Commission on Cognition (ICC, not to be confused with the International Criminal Court or the Interstate Commerce Commission) that defines key terms for AI/AGI/ASI research.\n\nThe rub is that this can’t be a purely scientific undertaking. Defining the terms related to AI, AGI/ASI would be a task deeply enmeshed with philosophy of mind. Fortunately, we wouldn’t have to agree on any metaphysical conception of the mind. We merely need to have a common language (ideally, a formalizable language that can be integrated seamlessly into the formalizations of the natural sciences) in which to discuss the mind. That are many areas of human life that are deeply enmeshed with traditional philosophical problems—it was, after all, human life that suggested these philosophical problems—and we nevertheless find a way of going on about the business of life without having agreed beforehand on any overarching metaphysical framework. We could do this with mind also, though the challenges are greater, because, even setting aside metaphysical disagreements, merely agreeing on the concepts to be employed in the description of cognition is controversial.   \n\nThat the ASI community is trying to match three pounds of homegrown wetware powered by pizza and hamburgers with acres of data centers and billions of dollars ought to be your first clue that something doesn’t quite add up. It’s somewhat like the race to build a marine chronometer, which was pursued with large mechanisms for many years, until John Harrison built a marine chronometer about the side of a large pocketwatch. It would be not only an ironic outcome, but a real existential threat you could say, if any prohibitions on the development of ASI ended up crippling an industry even while other and more imaginative researchers ended up producing ASI in their garage by formalizing and mechanizing the actual processes of human thought rather than mimicking them on a grand scale.   \n\nBest wishes,\n\nNick\n\nPS—Last week I asked the question, “Is origins of life an intrinsically planetary-scale process?” and I suggested some mechanisms that point to this being the case. I’ve just realized that an important distinction needs to be emphasized throughout any such discussion, a distinction between boundary conditions and specific mechanisms. The specific mechanisms that result in the origins of life may not involve the boundary conditions that made it possible for the specific mechanisms to produce life, and certainly it won’t involve *all* the boundary conditions. It may be the case that the entirety of the universe is the boundary condition for life to arise on Earth, but the mechanisms on Earth that resulted in the origins of life don’t need to invoke the origins of the universe, which are among the boundary conditions for life.  \n\nWhen positing an unfamiliar idea (I haven’t heard anyone else ask, “Is origins of life an intrinsically planetary-scale process?” so I assume that it’s at least somewhat unfamilar), one often has to go overboard in emphasizing the conditions and qualifications to which the idea is subject, which has the consequence of muddying the exposition. Since an unfamiliar idea shines best when its exposition is clean and uncluttered, the (obvious) conditions and qualifications are often passed over, which leaves what appears as a vulnerability that attracts trivial criticisms. This is probably a lot of what’s going on with the AI/AGI/ASI discussion.\n\n# Newsletter link:\n\n[https://mailchi.mp/35b5b0948371/the-view-from-oregon-373](https://mailchi.mp/35b5b0948371/the-view-from-oregon-373)\n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/The_View_from_Oregon/comments/1q2a6kx/artificial_superintelligence_slouches_towards/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0}}

It was very fluid and filled the mold quickly. After opening the mold I sawed off the sprue (from the left poured in) and wirebrushed the attached sand using a small wirebrush on the Dremel.  \nNow I see some parts are just smooth (slightly above the center) while others are coarse, despite the original pattern being smooth on the inside.  \nWhy does the sand adhere so easily to the copper ? The sand is just fine silica sand mixed with 5% bentonite binder and some water.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MetalCasting/comments/1q2a5gd/why_is_the_texture_of_this_casting_so_coarse/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1}}

Rarely are they nightmares, just the kind of dream that sticks with you for most of the day.  A few of my recent ones have left me chuckling to myself.  Being part of a penguin family but I was just my usual self, shuffling through the snow trying to protect my penguin wife’s egg.  Getting into a bar fight with a group of Hell’s Angels because I kept turning down their advances. Walking along a giant dinosaur’s teeth as its mouth slowly closed around me.  All dreams I still remember to this day.\n\nI’ve been told to start keeping a dream journal but I haven’t found a need to.  I must have some form of photographic memory, but only for useless memories that never happened.  I don’t mind it.  Sometimes existing in those memories can be a brief escape from reality.\n\nThat’s what I thought for a long time at least.  I had a dream the other night that I can’t seem to shake.\n\nI was walking in the woods near my apartment.  A beautiful state park, along a Great Lake. I knew it well.  There are no roads through the park, just the parking lot at the south-end, a few miles from the highway. You’d leave your car there and start hiking North.  There were a few trails, one running perpendicular to the lake on the East side.  This is the trail I was on during my dream.  It was dark out and gently snowing, large heavy snowflakes.  Most of the trees barren of leaves, save for the few pinetrees that cast shadows across the path.  I could glance to my right and see the slow, rolling waves, lazily dying into the frost covered pebble beach.  It felt peaceful.  Everything was so familiar.  I walked for what felt like the entire night, following this path I knew so well, never growing tired, never questioning why I was here in the dead of night. An owl cooed somewhere to my left.  Small corn snakes slithered off the path in front of me as to not be stepped on, I thought I saw a kangaroo bounding somewhere along the beach.  I wish I could stay he--  Wait.  That doesn’t seem right.\n\nI abruptly stopped my calm stride and with it the forest stopped too.  No more distant owl, no more evergreens scratching their naked neighbors with their needles moved by the wind.  In fact there was no more wind.  It was as if the entire world stopped with me.  I didn’t dare move, as to not interrupt this sudden stillness.  Standing still for minutes on end, I waited for something to make a noise.  Anything. “Please, something move.  I can’t take this anymore.”  I thought to myself. In hindsight, I should have just pinched myself and been done with this strange dream.  But it felt wrong to interject.\n\n\n\nWhat felt like hours had passed when I caught a shadow in my peripheral.  Something down by the water.  “Thank God.”  I could finally move.  Using my new-found freedom I ducked under a fallen tree to try and get an eye on whatever had cast it..  Peering over the dead wood I saw the silhouette of the kangaroo on the beach.  It had felt so out of place before, but if it was, no one had told it. It walked on all 4s in a large circle, maybe 12 feet in diameter.  When it had completed its circle, it slowly hopped to the center and began to rise up, standing on its hind legs and raising its head.  It stared at the night sky and slowly opened its mouth releasing a bellowing howl.  I covered my ears, though it did almost nothing to block the noise.  Small birds fell from the trees, bouncing off the dead branches of the birch trees and softly hitting the ground with blood seeping from their heads.  The night sky darkened, one by one stars blinking out.  The howl continued, unwavering, as if a call to the heavens themselves.  When it finally stopped I lay on the frozen ground, hoping my hearing would return.  After a few minutes of silence and the ringing beginning to fade, I dared to look over the dead tree once more.  As my eyes peered over once more, I had to stifle a scream.  The kangaroo stood only a few feet from me, for the first time as not just a silhouette.  I could see its hairless face, with lidless black eyes.  Poorly scabbed legs, with thick wriggling earth-worms crawling from the unhealed wounds.  \n\n\n\nThe last thing I remember was the sweet smell that almost sizzled off its skin.  A smell of honey and mulberry.  A smell I will not soon forget.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q2a3nj/i_saw_a_kangaroo_in_my_dream/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0}}
