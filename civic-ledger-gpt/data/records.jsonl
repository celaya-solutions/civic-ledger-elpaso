The project is being led by STACK Infrastructure in partnership with BorderPlex Digital Assets. With an estimated total investment of up to $165,000,000,000 it represents one of the most significant private-sector infrastructure initiatives in the region’s history.\nIndustrial Revenue Bonds (IRB)\nIn the State of New Mexico, an IRB helps attract jobs and investment by offering a tax abatement, and it doesn’t place a financial risk on the Government entity authorizing it. It’s a common tool used by other communities to stay competitive in attracting major projects.\nWhat is an Industrial Revenue Bond, IRB?\nIt is a common economic development tool used by states and local governments to attract businesses that will bring jobs to an area. The participating companies fund the project. When a company gets an IRB approved, they won’t pay property taxes during the time the IRB is in place but will almost always have to make “payment in lieu of taxes” (PILOT).\nWhy Would a Government Entity Issue an IRB for a project?\nA Government entity uses IRBs as a tool to attract projects; Doña Ana County has issued many IRBs in the past to support companies, either for expansion of their operations or to attract new businesses.\nIndustrial Revenue Bond (IRB) Life Cycle\n|\nMilestone |\nExplanation |\n|\n1. Application |\nCompany submits application. County reviews application, checking if project benefits the community. |\n|\n2. Application |\nCompany pays a $25,000 application fee, which helps cover the County’s processing costs. |\n|\n3. County Bond Attorney |\nRepresents the County in the bond process |\n|\n4. Negotiation |\nNegotiate IRB terms and determine PILOT = Payment in Lieu of Taxes, which are special payments instead of property taxes. |\n|\n5. 30-Day Notice Letters |\nCounty notifies all entities that levy property taxes within the county. - Sent to County Assessor and any entity located within the County authorized to levy property taxes in the County.\n- Must be mailed at least 30 days prior to final consideration of the Bond Ordinance.\n- Sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.\n- Notice includes amount, purpose and the time period of proposed IRB\n|\n|\n6. Inducement Resolution |\nCounty votes to begin the IRB process and publication of hearing notice. |\n|\n7. Public Hearing Notice of Intent to Consider Ordinance |\nPublished in local newspaper at least 14 days before Bond Ordinance consideration meeting. |\n|\n8. Bond Ordinance Consideration |\nCounty Commission considers Bond Ordinance and, if approved by the Commission, authorizes the issuance of the IRBs. |\n|\n9. Publish Notice of Bond Adoption |\n30-day period of limitation of action. County finalizes agreements and closing documents during this time. |\n|\n10. Closing/ Project Conveyed |\nDocuments signed. Financing starts. Earliest = 30 days after notice of adoption of Bond Ordinance publication. Ownership of project property transferred (bare legal title) to County. County leases project property back to Company under the IRB Lease |\n|\n11. During IRB term |\nCompany leases property back from the County and makes Rent payments under the IRB Lease to repay the Bonds. Company also makes PILOT payments. |\n|\n12. Repayment |\nBonds repaid over long term, which depends on IRB terms. |\n|\n13. Final Maturity of Bonds |\nFace value of Bonds repaid to bond purchasers. |\n|\n14. End of IRB Term |\nCounty transfers property to Company and the Company begins paying property taxes on the project property. |\nSafeguards\n- Facilities Closure Claw Backs: If company closes early, it must repay all or a portion of tax breaks.\n- Job Targets: Company must meet promised employment goals and failure to meet them results in repayment of tax breaks or increased PILOT payments, based upon agreement structure.\n- Certain Defaults by Company: The County can terminate the IRB Lease and transfer the property back to the Company, putting the property back on the tax rolls.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "d892cee9772f8d12948153364f4c24bcbeece12b905e1f692947e0f4f8be5a81", "out_path": "raw/html/https_www.donaana.gov_about_us_economic_development_projects.php.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

(KFOX14/CBS4) —A community organization and two residents have filed a lawsuit against the Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners, alleging the county violated state and local law when it approved ordinances tied to the proposed $165 billion Project Jupiter data center in Santa Teresa.\nThe complaint, filed Oct. 17 in the Third Judicial District Court by the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, represents Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County and residents José Saldaña Jr. of Sunland Park and Vivian Fuller of Santa Teresa.\nThe lawsuit challenges three ordinances adopted by the county commission.\nThe first authorizes the issuance of $165 billion in Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRBs) for the project.\nThe second and third ordinances authorize Local Economic Development Act (LEDA) funding to support Project Jupiter, including anticipated permit fees.\nCommissioners approved the measures in two separate 4-1 votes in September and October, with Commissioner Susana Chaparro voting against both times.\nRELATED: Doña Ana County approves $165 billion AI data center despite protests and calls for delay\nPlaintiffs claim the county relied on a single, incomplete application from Project Jupiter’s developers that contained blank and missing pages and lacked critical information necessary to make a fully informed decision.\nThe filing also states that county officials held private meetings with the project’s developers months before the public hearings and signed a non-disclosure agreement earlier this year.\nPlaintiffs argue that these actions limited transparency and prevented residents from fully understanding the project before the votes.\nThe lawsuit seeks judicial review of the ordinances, a court order invalidating the county’s approval, and a stay halting implementation while the case proceeds.\nProject Jupiter, led by Borderplex Digital Assets, would include a hyperscale data center, microgrid, battery storage, and a desalination plant.\nCounty officials have previously described the project as one of the largest potential commercial developments in New Mexico history, with the potential to bring thousands of jobs.\nCommunity members and environmental advocates have raised concerns about the project’s potential strain on water and energy resources and its impacts on surrounding neighborhoods, as well as the longevity of the jobs the center would bring.\nThe full press release can be found on the New Mexico Environmental Law Center website.\nWe have reached out to each of the County Commissioners for comment and have not heard back.\nWe will keep you updated both on air and online when new details arise.\nRELATED: Project Jupiter ignites debate: Economic tech boom or ecological bane for Borderland?\nSign up to receive the top interesting stories from in and around our community once daily in your inbox.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "86e8950420d32b3e6efd567e3e88532c525912f0f4aec630f218c041fa401c68", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_newsletter-daily_community-group-sues-dona-ana-county-commissioners-over-project-jupiter-approval.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

While supporters tout billions in investment and hundreds of new jobs, residents nearby are voicing serious concerns about water usage, electricity and the effects on their neighborhoods.\nThe data center is currently under construction in the northeast part of the city of El Paso. Meta says it selected El Paso for its workforce, available open land and access to renewable energy. As the project advances, many in this community are now asking questions about how they’ll be affected by one of the region’s largest tech investments.\nIn the desert area on the outskirts of the city, the massive 1.2 million-square-foot facility is now under construction. It’s the tech giant’s future data center, a project Jon Barela of the Borderplex Alliance —an organization focused on economic development in El Paso, Las Cruces, New Mexico and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico—says has been in the works for four years.\n“It is one of the best world companies, so to have them here it’s an absolute honor here in El Paso County, and we are thrilled to have them and welcome them here.” Barela said.\nHe describes Meta’s arrival as a turning point for the region and the result of years of work to position El Paso as a hub for advanced data and AI infrastructure.\n“I have been working with other valued community partners, elected officials, the city and county levels, and of course, our utilities El Paso Water, and El Paso Electric, which are very much part of this team to locate this project, which would be at least $1.5 billion initial investment with hopefully many more billions to come,” he said.\nBarela says he has witnessed the impact firsthand. In 2016, he helped recruit Meta to build its first New Mexico data center in Los Lunas.\n“Their construction is complete, and thousands of jobs have been created in that area. The population has grown at a good rate there in central New Mexico, and there have been many positive things that have happened,” he said.\nBut it’s Barela’s work with El Paso Water and El Paso Electric that many in this community are most interested in. The new facility will require large amounts of electricity to cool its servers.\nEl Paso is not on the Texas grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). But while Meta says the site will operate on 100% renewable energy, neighbors worry it could still strain the local power grid.\nWater usage has sparked even greater controversy. Meta’s design relies on evaporative cooling. Initial estimates suggest the facility could consume up to 1.5 billion gallons of water each year, an amount that residents fear may affect water availability and raise rates.\n“It’s good that they are bringing another company, and it’s good that they are bringing job opportunities, but to take 1.5 billion gallons of water for the community, I think they need to research that more and possibly find a better way to do it instead of taking out the water from homeowners,” said Richard Herrera, a neighbor to the data center.\nEl Paso Water insists the region can manage the increased demand, stating the final system design will require much less water than initially estimated and that Meta will cover the full cost of any necessary infrastructure upgrades. However, for families already coping with rising utility bills, the ongoing uncertainty is troubling.\n“It’s very bad, and also when there is too much water using the bills are going up again, every year they go up, and that’s not good for the people who work for our families, and having bills too high is not good,” said Martin Ramos, another neighbor of the data center.\nMeta says the project will create 1,200 construction jobs at its peak and approximately 100 long-term positions, while generating millions in local tax revenue. Construction is expected to continue through 2028.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "92db786011ec140512b3efa8ff1975eceaac77192a3befa221d643e72890de18", "out_path": "raw/html/https_spectrumlocalnews.com_tx_austin_news_2025_11_24_meta-data-center-in-east-el-paso-concerns-local-residents.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

We won’t stop fighting.\nThey only win when we give up. And we are not giving up.\nOur work and the fight continues.\nWe will keep showing up alongside our clients and communities fighting for our people and Mother Earth.\nOUR MISSION\nThe New Mexico Environmental Law Center has been defending environmental justice since 1987. It is our mission to work with New Mexico’s communities to protect their air, land and water in the fight for environmental justice.\nAt the Law Center, we are working hard with under-resourced communities in New Mexico to ensure that they have the same clean air, land and water that every New Mexican is entitled to. We are on the legal front line fighting to not only keep environmental regulations, but to make them even stronger. Support our work to protect New Mexico.\nThe New Mexico Environmental Law Center is committed to dismantling the racist structures that are at the heart of environmental injustice and all disparate treatment of communities of color. If we do not respect the water we drink, the air we breathe, the land we sow, and the community in which we live, we cannot realize the fundamental human rights to which we are all entitled. We stand with those seeking justice and will continue to utilize our platform to support our state and its people.\nNote: the Law Center is currently only considering requests for assistance on a limited basis.\nCongratulations to our Executive Director!\nCongratulations to all the awardees of the Rachel’s Network Catalyst Award, including our very own Executive Director, Dr. Virginia Necochea!\nThis award honors women leaders of color for their commitment to a healthy planet and, according to Rachel’s Network President Fern Shepard, “This year’s awardees and finalists demonstrate that women of color are catalyzing change across our field, from environmental justice and energy equity to marine science and health. Their leadership is transforming our world for the better.”\nRachel’s Network, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit named in honor of Rachel Carson, is a community of women at the intersection of environment, philanthropy, and women’s leadership who exchange ideas and take action on our planet’s urgent challenges.\nCongrats Dr. Necochea!\nIMPORTANT ARTICLES\nENVIRONMENTAL RACISM\nMany people understand the environment as a force of nature that cannot favor or disfavor different populations. However, similar to all things on Earth, the environment is subject to human influences. Unfortunately, these influences often tend to lower their hands to the worsts of our society including racism and classism. This can ultimately create environmental racism…\nREJECT HIDDEN MINING APPROVALS IN COVID-19 RELIEF LEGISLATION\nHard rock mining is considered to be the most toxic industry in the US. That’s why a nationwide coalition of environmental & public health advocates are calling on Congress to reject hidden industry handouts in the COVID-19 relief package…\nNEW MEXICO RULES ON FRACKING\nEnvironmentalists leveled sharp criticisms at rules dealing with recycled water produced during oil and gas extraction in New Mexico. Environmentalists also criticized regulators for offering a rule they claim is too narrow to address environmental and public health concerns and abdicates responsibility to other state personnel who also don’t have a rule that addresses their worries…\nWHY WE SUPPORT THE CLIMATE EQUITY ACT\nSince 1987, the New Mexico Environmental Law Center has worked alongside communities in our state in the name of environmental justice. Our staff and attorneys pursue legislation and court battles on behalf of clients, working on cases that often take years of court filings and appeals to wind their way through the legal system.\nIn Solidarity with Protestors…\nThe events of the last weeks – which have their origins in the very beginning of our nation’s history – have laid bare the inequities that are the mainstay of America. The state sponsored violence is vicious and jarring and has resulted in widespread popular resistance. The New Mexico Environmental Law Center unequivocally condemns police violence and stands in solidarity with the communities impacted by police violence and the Black Lives Matter movement.\nThe massive protest against police violence and systemic racism also provides a glimpse into the more mundane, but equally caustic, day to day violence that existing racist structures perpetuate. The daily machinery of oppression includes the wide array of environmental and public health laws that mediate how each of us relates to the larger global ecosystem.\nWhile our nation’s environmental laws are held up as a bastion of progressivism, they do not serve everyone equally. The environmental movement is rooted in the privilege of affluence and whiteness that has historically excluded communities of color.\nWe in the environmental movement are often the beneficiaries of the privileges that at the same time oppress our neighbors and allies. It would be easy for the Law Center to retweet a statement from a frontline organization or post something on our website expressing outrage at the latest incidents of state violence and then go about our lives. It’s much more difficult and important to engage in meaningful and thoughtful evaluation of our place in the framework that perpetuates violence and oppression.\nWe believe, however, that only with a hard look at ourselves and the system we work in can we begin to really understand and resist the systemic racist structures that dictate who has clean water, air and land and who must pay the price for industrial “progress” that ostensibly benefits us all, but in reality only serves a few. At the Law Center, we acknowledge that we have benefited from the status quo and have begun the difficult and essential process necessary to become a more equitable and inclusive organization. We are having conversations both internally and with community partners to identify ways in which we may have perpetuated oppressive structures and find ways to address our shortcomings to become better partners with communities.\nWe also call on our white friends and colleagues to reject the easy tropes that “environmental laws protect everyone” or “governments are well meaning” and to truly examine our system of environmental law and policy and ask whether it also contributes to the day to day violence that communities of color live with. We call on our friends and colleagues to consider that environmentalism is more than protecting a scenic area for recreation or aesthetic beauty, but is also a fundamental struggle to ensure human and civil rights to the basic conditions necessary for survival and human dignity. We call on our white friends and colleagues to listen deeply to communities of color; to step up when called to, to step back when asked and to stand in solidarity no matter what.\nLaw Center Client\nRed Water Pond Community\nAs World War Two was ending, the growing nuclear arms race put the US in need of uranium. It turned to Navajo Nation, where the uranium mining industry thrived for four decades — but left disease, pollution and the biggest radioactive spill in US history. That spill in Church Rock, New Mexico upended the lives of nearby residents, who had to grapple with toxic water, livestock and a lifetime of illnesses. Now, they are still waiting for it to be cleaned up.\nNEWS\n12/15/25 Follow Up Letter to NMED -Acoma LLC Applications\nMonday, December 15, 2025\nRe: Request for Adequate Public Notice – Acoma LLC Permit Applications\nDear New Mexico Environment Department:\nThank you for your response to our December 12 letter, attached, expressing initial interest in Acoma, LLC’s two air pollution permit applications for the following facilities related to Project Jupiter …\n12/12/25 Letter to NMED -Acoma LLC Applications\nFriday, December 12, 2025\nDear New Mexico Environment Department:\nPlease accept this letter expressing initial interest in two air quality permit applications and corresponding Notices of Air Quality Permit Applications published in the Las Cruces Sun News on November 14, 2025.

King of Church Rock once worked in the mines that line the Rio Puerco between Red Water Pond Road Community and Church Rock. The United Nuclear spill of 1979 into the Rio Puerco – the largest accidental release of radiation in US history – surged through the land that he and his family call home. He joined ENDAUM in its early days, and has become a leader in the fight to prevent new uranium mining in Diné communities. Following are excerpts from a video interview with Larry.\n“When I first joined in 1997, I didn’t see myself twenty years down the road, or even several years later, working on this. I thought maybe it would be resolved in three years – no more than 10 years. But twenty years later, we’re still here. It’s a long and hideous process. A lot of sleepless nights. A lot of worries.”\n“Our organization, with the help of the Law Center and other groups, was able to educate our elected Tribal officials and our President at the time… We were also successful in getting a Navajo Nation law passed to ban uranium mining in Navajo Country.”\n“A total ban on new uranium mining… and cleanup. Compensate the workers [who worked in the industry after 1971 who do not qualify for the federal Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]. That would be justice.”\n“Advice for communities just starting a fight against a big polluter: be persistent, be vigilant, don’t give up. Your first target would be your elected officials. Target them, educate them. From there, once you get all of those people on your side, it’s easy.”\n“If the Law Center disappeared…that would be a huge, tremendous loss. We’d have to start from ground zero. I would be forever in shock because the companies that we’ve been so far lucky to keep away from our communities, once they found out, they would come charging in. That would be a huge catastrophe.”\n“To all the people who donate to keep the NMELC going, I extend my deep appreciation.” – Larry J.

A gift planned now to be realized after your lifetime can establish your legacy well into the future. You can earmark a gift for a specific program area, or allow the Law Center to allocate it where it is most needed. In either case, such a gift will help ensure that the Law Center can field a legal team and support staff to continue protecting New Mexico’s air, water, land and ways of life for as long as such work is needed.\nThere are many ways to make a planned gift. Bequests are the simplest and most common form, and can be stated as a specific dollar amount, a percentage of assets, or the residual of an estate. Cash or certain other tangible assets can also be transferred through a retirement plan, life insurance, or a charitable trust. Some giving options, such as charitable trusts, can also provide income during your lifetime to you or a loved one.

Given your strong commitment to the health and well-being of New Mexico’s children, most recently demonstrated through your initiative to guarantee no-cost universal child care to all New Mexicans – we urge you to act quickly to protect children who stand to be the most impacted by LANL’s actions this weekend.\nAs you know, tritium is a highly radioactive isotope of ordinary, non-radioactive hydrogen. Given its structure, tritium bonds very easily to water, creating a vapor that is highly absorbable by the human body, pervading every cell. Tritium can be very dangerous if inhaled and has been shown to cause cancer, genetic mutations and birth defects. The amount of tritium LANL proposes to vent is three-times more tritium than would be dumped into the Pacific Ocean from the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan over the course of thirty years.\nNotably, the dose to an infant from tritiated water vapor is estimated to be over three times greater than the dose to any adult expected to be exposed on Saturday. LANL has never considered the impacts to children from this project.\nRather than address LANL’s gross mismanagement of its nuclear waste, the New Mexico Environment Department, just a few days ago, made a rushed and reckless decision to authorize LANL’s venting, regardless of the uncertainty, the lack of adequate infrastructure to notify the public in the event of an emergency, and LANL’s disregard for the impacts of creating contaminated rain water, even in the face of rain forecasted for Saturday afternoon.\nAs the state’s only exclusively environmental-justice focused law center, the New Mexico Environmental Law Center has been engaging with communities impacted by LANL’s toxic legacy for over three decades. NMED’s most recent decision only perpetuates the same environmental and cultural violence LANL has inflicted upon communities since LANL’s creation. We are calling on you to do the right thing for New Mexico’s children and put a stop to LANL’s upcoming tritium venting.\nRespectfully,\nDr. Virginia Necochea\nExecutive Director\nNew Mexico Environmental Law Center\n/s/ Maslyn Locke\nMaslyn Locke\nSenior Staff Attorney\nNew Mexico Environmental Law Center\n/s/ Eric Jantz\nEric Jantz\nLegal Director\nNew Mexico Environmental Law Center\n/s/ Kacey Hovden\nKacey Hovden\nStaff Attorney\nNew Mexico Environmental Law Center\nRead full letter.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "07a67a148a3eb920d814d2210ce12350811447b3123f85c287e752632e4c5868", "out_path": "raw/html/https_nmelc.org_2025_09_12_nmelc-letter-to-governor-michelle-lujan-grisham-urging-to-halt-tritium-venting.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

We’re having a major problem in this country because your zip codes are dictating your life expectancy. You don’t have access to care. There’s not availability of newer technologies. We have problems with maternity mortality rates -- all kinds of problems.”\nOz said that’s why President Donald Trump, along with Congress, is giving $50 billion -- $1 billion to each state – over the course of five years. He said the point of the money is not to pay the bills, but to revamp the program and get to the root cause of why it’s not functional.\n“For example, can we improve the technology that’s available so you get tele-medicine or even technology within hospitals so they can take better care of patients?” Oz said. “How do we connect the bigger hospitals to the smaller hospitals? How do we get people to go work in rural America?”\nOz said much of what holds back rural America to be healthy are “old-fashioned rules that just need to be changed.”\nFor more, watch the video player above or visit The National News Desk’s YouTube channel for Murray's full interview with Oz.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "534a9bd594e854a1eeb8c20e1d4e88b9ef00914dc0d7c8172a79037e5c473907", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_news_nation-world_trumps-50-billion-healthcare-boost-targets-crisis-in-rural-america-life-expectancy-doctors-nurses-physici.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

Cole is accused of planting the bombs on the eve of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.\nRELATED | Pipe bomb suspect appears in federal court, defense seeks pretrial release\nAttorneys for the 30-year-old requested that he go under house arrest at his grandmother's house in Gainesville, saying he poses no danger to the public and an ankle monitor will give the Court reasonable assurance he won't flee.\nProsecutors argued that Cole is a danger to the community, pointing to the bomb-making materials they said he bought as recently as three years ago, that he hid at home and the hundreds of times they said that he wiped his cell phone clean.\nThe judge ultimately sided with the prosecution.\n\"The court is keenly aware that pretrial detention must be 'the carefully limited exception' due in no small part to the fact that Mr. Cole, like all defendants, is entitled to the presumption of innocence at this juncture. And the Court understands its 'grave constitutional obligation to ensure that the facts and circumstances of each case warrant this exceptional treatment.' But based on the Court's careful consideration of the relevant factors that govern its determination, this case fits that bill,\" the ruling from Judge Matthew Sharbaugh reads.\nRead the full ruling below:\nA recent court filing from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia states Cole confessed two hours into his interview with the FBI after investigators showed him a still image of the suspect from surveillance video close in time to the planting of the bombs.\nAccording to prosecutors' filing, Cole denied to investigators that his actions were directed toward Congress or related to the proceedings scheduled to take place on Jan. 6, when the 2020 presidential election results were supposed to be certified but were ultimately delayed by rioters who broke into the U.S. Capitol Building, alleging the election was rigged. The bombs never went off and were discovered the following afternoon.\nCole told investigators that \"something just snapped\" after “watching everything, just everything getting worse,\" states the court filing, amid questions raised by President Donald Trump and Republicans about the results of the 2020 presidential election. There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election.\nCole's charges include transporting an explosive device in interstate commerce with the intent to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or unlawfully to damage or destroy any building, vehicle, or other real or personal property. He is also charged with attempted malicious destruction by means of fire and explosive materials.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "435ae1661d89ee164ec9b66b73d113f6528609c00cdacd07ae39ec4a09f43a83", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_news_nation-world_dc-pipe-bomb-suspect-will-remain-locked-up-ahead-of-trial-brian-cole-prosecution-defense-january-six-dona.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

We already have the land field, we have a power plant, we have a cycle. They just come, private companies come, make money and they do. It's just a hazard.\"\nAccording to the project website, Project Jupiter and Stargate promise to:\n- Limit water use to domestic employee needs\n- Build and supply their own power\n- Invest up to $165 billion in Doña Ana County\n- Deliver $300 million in direct payments to the county\n- Create over 2,500+ construction jobs and 750+ permanent jobs\nDespite these assurances, many in the community remain vigilant, watching to see if these promises are fulfilled once construction begins.\nSign up to receive the top interesting stories from in and around our community once daily in your inbox.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "39f055b395497129b804e5576cfca707b334b55f5d0c308ab3d5fa78732e48b0", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_news_local_project-jupiter-ignites-debate-economic-tech-boom-or-ecological-bane-for-borderland-project-stargate-president-t.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

Now, Marcus is entering a new chapter: one shaped by a cancer diagnosis that changed everything.\nEarlier this year, doctors told him he may have only months to live. But instead of retreating, the 72-year-old is doing what he’s always done, turning life into art and using this moment to fuel a powerful new phase of his creative work.\n“I am counting on a huge miracle, granted, but I'm also preparing for going on a long journey,” said Marcus during a recent interview at his studio in Sunset Heights.\nMarcus has been making art nearly every day since he was sixteen. A cancer diagnosis hasn’t changed that. If anything, it has only sharpened his focus.\n“They gave me six months to live. It was four months ago, and I'm more healthy now than I was four months ago when they diagnosed me,” said Marcus. “At least that's my perception. I haven't put like an x-ray camera into my body, but I'm telling you, I'm here, I'm alive. I wake up at two o'clock in the morning and go in my studio and I'm creating new art, and I'm here with you. So, I think that that's proof.”\nHal’s life has been marked by both commercial success and creative freedom. For more than thirty years, he’s owned and operated the Hal Marcus Gallery. He’s also helped create the Sunset Parlor, a space for live music, wellness and community. But since the diagnosis, the urgency to keep creating has intensified.\n“I finally, just like three weeks ago, came up with the idea that my medicine is to do whatever I need to do to make me happy, to enjoy every single moment and to spend as much time in my studio,” said Marcus. “And that's my medicine.”\nWATCH:\nMarcus says much of his resilience comes from the people around him.\nSupporters, collaborators and friends who continue to show up. One of them is Luke Lowenfield, who partnered with Hal to create a series of children’s books rooted in imagination and kindness.\n“What he's taught me is that ‘Luke, if you love to write, you've got to write every day. You've got to do everything as a writer. That's what you're here to do.’ And so, I think that's going to be his legacy is he has modeled for us all as an artist. What an artist does, lives with passion and artistry every day and does everything as an artist,” said Lowenfield. ”And so, I think his legacy will be to tune in to your heart's desire, tune in to the purpose for which you are here and do that with the people that you love all day, every day. Commit yourself to vote yourself to that.”\nAnd then there’s his family.\n“I mean, it's such an interesting thing because I do have those two parts of me where the daughter wants to control and fix and tell them what to eat and tell them what to do and freaking out,” said his daughter Leilainia Marcus. “But then I have to step back and be the human, having a human experience with this person I admire and look up to as not attached to him as my father. And I just feel so much beauty. So much beauty in the way that he's experienced life and that he's transformed his own life and my life and the people around him. He walks into a room and the energy of the room changes. And that's been since before I can remember.\nAnd his wife, Patricia Medici, who for decades has been the steady hand behind the business side of Hal Marcus.\n“That's one of the things Hal has a great support team with his family and his close friends. And he revels in that. He knows it,” said Medici. “And it makes him happy too.”\nLately, Hal’s work has taken a new direction. Birds have become a central theme. Symbols of movement, fragility, and freedom.\n“That's a part of my evolution at the stage in my life where I'm getting closer to heaven or I'm getting tuned in more with the freedom,” Marcus said. “I'm saying is that whatever your issue is and you always wanted to do it, do it now.”\nHe’s also cutting up his old shirts, repurposing the fabric into layered, mixed-media panels. Pieces of his own history stitched directly into the work.\nAnd now, Hal is choosing to share his diagnosis publicly. Not for sympathy. Not for pity. But as an invitation. A reminder to do the thing you love, while you still can.\n“If people ask me what can I do to help you, because they're always saying, ‘Can I bring you something? Can I do something for you?’ Well, (my daughter) had a good idea. She'd tell me, ‘Just tell everybody to do what they love doing.’ You know, and whatever obstacles in your way, forget that, just do what you love doing. And if they can understand that message, that's going to help me out a lot,” Marcus said. “You know, because I don't need anything, you know. I mean, I need your love and your prayers, yeah, but, you know, I'm a happy camper.”\nFor Hal Marcus, that means showing up to the studio. Every day. And continuing to tell the story of this place and his place within it, for as long as he’s able.\nRECOMMENDED: El Paso Police seek public help to identify suspects in Adult Video Warehouse theft\nSign up to receive the top interesting stories from in and around our community once daily in your inbox.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "06f164cbc5783319f64118a3663a52da8dc818f558707bbce998fd3dfee416a5", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_news_local_beloved-local-artist-grapples-with-cancer-diagnosis.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

Neither NMED nor NMDOH staff made presentations on health impacts of arsenic, which had been in the promotional materials for the Town Hall.

Residents shared stories and directed their disappointment and frustration at state officials for dodging responsibility, passing the buck, lacking transparency, and taking too long to fix the water crisis problems.\nSunland Park resident and NMELC client José Saldana said, “The Governor promised us that the increase of the water was not going to happen. She promised us, the community, that she was going to stop the increase of the water bill and nothing has happened. So that’s why we made this meeting.

The state sponsored violence is \nvicious and jarring and  has resulted in widespread popular resistance.  The New Mexico \nEnvironmental Law Center unequivocally condemns police violence and sta nds in solidarity with \nthe communities impacted by police violence and the Black Lives Matter movement.   \n \nThe massive protest against police violence and systemic racism also provides a glimpse into the \nmore mundane, but equally caustic, day to day violence that existing racist structures perpetuate.  \nThe daily machinery of oppression includes the wide array of environmental and public health \nlaws that mediate how each of us relates to the larger global ecosystem.   \n \nWhile our nation’s environmental laws are held up as a bastion of progressivism, they do not serve \neveryone equally.  The environmental movement is rooted in the privilege of affluence and \nwhiteness that has historically excluded communities of color.   \n \nWe in the environmental movement are often the beneficiaries of the privileges that at the same \ntime oppress our neighbors and allies.  It would be easy for the Law Center to retweet a statement \nfrom a frontline organization or post somethi ng on our website expressing outrage at the latest \nincidents of state violence and then go about our lives.  It’s much more difficult and important to \nengage in meaningful and thoughtful evaluation of our place in the framework that perpetuates \nviolence and oppression.    \n \nWe believe, however, that only with a hard look at ourselves and the system we work in can we \nbegin to really understand and resist the systemic racist structures that dictate who has clean \nwater, air and land and who must pay the price for industrial “progress” that ostensibly benefits us \nall, but in reality only serves a few. At the Law Center, we acknowledge that we have benefited \nfrom the status quo and have  begun the difficult and essential process necessary to become a \nmore equitable and inclusive organization.  We are having conversations both internally and with \ncommunity partners to identify ways in which we may have perpetuated oppressive structures \nand find ways to address our shortcomings to become better partners with communities.   \n \nWe also call on our  white friends and colleagues to reject the easy tropes that “environmental \nlaws protect everyone” or “governments are well meaning” and to truly examine our system of \nenvironmental law and policy and ask whether it also contributes to the day to day violence that \ncommunities of color live with.  We call on our friends and colleagues to consider that \nenvironmentalism is more than protecting a scenic area for recreation or aesthetic beauty, but is \nalso a fundamental struggle to ensure human and civil rights to the basic conditions necessary for \nsurvival and human dignity.

To date, it is the largest unrestricted gift NMELC has received in its 38 yearhistory and for that we remain eternally grateful and humbled!\nMany of you have asked or wondered what we’ve done with such an amazingly generous gift. I amhappy to share that the first thing we did was invest in our own staff by providing timely cost of livingadjustments and increasing our employer match for our retirement program. We also used a portion ofthe gift to offset budgetary deficits we’d been experiencing due to funder shifts and a national declinein individual giving most nonprofits faced a few years ago. \nBut, the most exciting update on how we’ve used this gift is the purchase of our own property! All of usat NMELC are proud to announce that we, after 38 years of existence, are the owners of our very ownoffice space! This once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase our own facility was only possiblebecause of the Yield Gift. Without this gift, the opportunity to transition from renting office space tohaving and owning a permanent home office would have remained an unreachable dream. This is atestament to how transformational large, unrestricted gifts can be for nonprofits everywhere. Owningour own property provides long-term stability and sustainability, asset building, and a strongcommunity presence for NMELC. \nAs I share this historic news with you, the emotions well upinside because I never imagined being in this positionespecially because of the major financial challenges ourorganization has faced in the past few years.\nI want to uplift and recognize all of the individuals whohelped us to achieve this major milestone because we donot accomplish such successes alone. \nI especially want to thank you for your continued supportand belief in my leadership. It is such an honor for me, aXicana from working class roots and from an environmentaljustice community, to lead such a powerful, committed,and wonderful organization.\nStay tuned for more details on our Office WarmingCelebration in December!\nIn solidarity,\nVirginia Necochea\n\nJ u s t i c e  i n  \nAction\nAlongside the Mountain View Coalition (MVC),\nNMELC fought for the implementation of the\nHealth, Equity and Environmental Impacts\n(HEEI) Rule, to protect air quality and community\nhealth in overburdened areas of Bernalillo\nCounty. NMELC and MVC are defending the rule\nagainst multiple appeals by industry groups and\nfiled a Civil Rights Complaint to the EPA against\nthe City of Albuquerque.\nAlongside Red Water Pond Road Community, NMELC fought for the removal\nof Quivira Mine uranium mine waste near Churchrock to the proposed,\nengineered and lined Red Rock Landfill. Together we led a successful\ncampaign to persuade EPA to choose removal to the Red Rock Landfill as the\npreferred option and clarified misinformation about the waste.\nAlongside Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County and Sunland\nPark/Santa Teresa community members, NMELC continued to support\nefforts to obtain clean and safe drinking water in Southern New Mexico,\nincluding pushing for federal and state investigations into the Camino\nReal Regional Utility Authority (CRRUA). We worked to not only protect\nthe fundamental right to clean and safe drinking water, but also to ensure\nwater remains in community hands. \nAlongside Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM) and \nRed Water Pond Road Community, NMELC brought together a multi-tribal\ndelegation to a historic Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)\nThematic Hearing in Washington, D.C., on “Impacts of Uranium Exploitation on the\nHuman Rights of Indigenous Peoples in the United States.” Through powerful and\nmoving testimony, the panel confronted the U.S. government on the devastating\nhealth, environmental and cultural impacts from the uranium industry.\nHEEI Rule Implementation\nQuivira Uranium Mine Waste Removal Plan\nArsenic Water Crisis in Sunland Park/Santa Teresa\nIACHR Thematic Hearing on \nUranium Impacts to Indigenous Peoples\nNMELC worked alongside Tewa Women United (TWU) in their campaign to protect all residents\nin surrounding communities—especially the most vulnerable, infants and children—urging the\nNew Mexico Environment Department (NMED) to deny Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)\na permit to vent dangerous radioactive tritium into the air, which was initially postponed.\nUnfortunately, on September 4, 2025, NMED authorized LANL’s project despite public\nopposition and many unknowns. NMELC continues to work with TWU and community partners\nto ensure transparency and accountability from NMED and LANL.\nLANL Tritium Venting \nAlongside Catron County residents, NMELC knocked down yet another\nillegal water grab attempt by Augustin Plains Ranch (APR), as a \nJudge denied APR’s latest request for a massive water transfer \nof 54,000 acre feet of water per year. Thousands of residents’ \naccess to precious water in the high desert remains protected.\nAugustin Plains Ranch Water Grab Denied\n\nWater Quality and WaterSpeculation & Rights cases\nAir Quality cases\nRadiation/Uranium cases\nOther Mining cases\nL o o k i n g  a t  t h e  \nA  H i s t o r i c  C o n f r o n t a t i o n\nb i g g e r  p i c t u r e\nA  T o x i c  T i m e l i n e  \n2 7\nc a s e s  \n a c r o s s  t h e  s t a t e\nA r s e n i c  l e v e l s  h a v e  e x c e e d e d  E P A  l i m i t s  r e p e a t e d l y  i n  t h e  t a p  w a t e r  o f  C a m i n o  R e a l\nR e g i o n a l  U t i l i t y  A u t h o r i t y  ( C R R U A )  c u s t o m e r s  i n  S u n l a n d  P a r k  a n d  S a n t a  T e r e s a .\nC h r o n i c  e x p o s u r e  h a s  l e d  t o  r a s h e s ,  h a i r  l o s s  a n d  o t h e r  h e a l t h  i m p a c t s .\nT h e  C o s t  o f  C o n t a m i n a t e d  W a t e r\no f  t a i l i n g s  t o w e r s  o v e r  t h e  \n 2 2  M I L L I O N  t o n s\nc o m m u n i t y  a n d  s t i l l  c o n t a m i n a t e s  t h e  a i r ,  l a n d  a n d  g r o u n d w a t e r .  \ni s  h o w  l o n g  H o m e s t a k e  B a r r i c k  G o l d  \n6 0  Y E A R S\nd u m p e d  r a d i o a c t i v e  w a s t e  n e a r  G r a n t s ,  N M .\nT h a n k s  t o  y o u r  g e n e r o u s  d o n a t i o n s ,  N M E L C  w a s  a b l e  t o  p r o v i d e\nc r i t i c a l l y  n e e d e d  s u p p o r t  t o  N a t i v e / I n d i g e n o u s  g r o u p s  a n d  m e m b e r s .\nW i t h  y o u r  g e n e r o s i t y ,  w e  a r e  f i g h t i n g  a l o n g s i d e  t h e  c o m m u n i t y  f o r  c l e a n  a n d  s a f e  d r i n k i n g\nw a t e r  f o r  o v e r\n1 9 , 0 0 0  r e s i d e n t s  i n  D o ñ a  A n a  C o u n t y .\nT h e s e  i n c l u d e :  E a s t e r n  N a v a j o  D i n é  \nA g a i n s t  U r a n i u m  M i n i n g  a n d  R e d  W a t e r  P o n d\nR o a d  C o m m u n i t y  i n  f r o n t  o f  t h e  I n t e r - A m e r i c a n\nC o m m i s s i o n  o n  H u m a n  R i g h t s  h e a r i n g  i n\nW a s h i n g t o n ,  D .

We all owe Doug a \nhuge debt of gratitude for his decades of work founding the Law Center and building it to \nthe force it is today, an achievement that was recognized when he received a Santa Fe \nLiving Treasure award in late 2019.\nThis leadership transition ushers in a momentous new era for the Law Center. We have \nstarted the search for a new Executive Director to lead the Law Center into the future, and \nare hiring two staff attorneys. In addition, the board and staff have taken the first steps \ntoward incorporating a greater focus on inclusion and diversity. Environmental justice has \nbeen our mission for nearly 30 years, but we realized the need to be more intentional in \ndeveloping internal diversity and equity policies to help better reflect external diversity \nand equity work and to improve our partnerships with clients and partners across the \nstate.\nMeanwhile, the past year brought significant legal developments as well. The collective \neffort of Law Center attorneys and our clients forced the Mt. Taylor zombie uranium mine \nto finally close and begin reclamation. We began working with local communities and \nstatewide organizations to resist a proposed mining exploration project in the upper Pe-\ncos watershed. Finally, we had two successful outcomes to years-long challenges to at-\ntempted corporate water grabs when judges denied both the Aquifer Science permit \napplication in the East Mountains near Albuquerque and the Augustin Plains Ranch appli-\ncation in Catron and Socorro Counties.\nY our generous support has made all these significant developments possible.

In January, on \nbehalf of the Red Water Pond Road Community Association, we filed a report with the United Nations \nHuman Rights Committee, arguing that the United States’ response to cleaning up historic uranium min-\ning and processing waste and permitting new uranium mines violates the International Covenant on Civil \nand Political Rights (ICCPR). Then, in December, in a stunning victory for Native communities, Rio Grande \nResources, owner of the Mt Taylor uranium mine, notified the state Mining and Minerals Division that \nit would cease mining operations and soon begin closure plan activity. Unfortunately, some of the dam-\nage to the area around this site is irreversible. (Clients: Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment and \nAmigos Bravos).\nNew World Cobalt submitted an application in June for \nexploratory mining for copper, zinc and gold at the pro-\nposed Tererro Mine north of Pecos. We worked with \nour client, the Upper Pecos Watershed Association, to \nsubmit comments on the application requesting strin-\ngent pollution prevention measures and have been \nworking closely with other environmental and wildlife \norganizations to develop strategies that get out ahead \nof any eventual mining activity.\nAIR\nThe Law Center has several air quality cases in the South Valley of Albuquerque and Bernalillo Coun-\nty. The most significant of these is a Title VI Civil Rights Complaint, which the SouthWest Organizing \nProject filed in 2014 with the US Environmental Protection Agency against the City and County. The \ncomplaint asserted that local decision-makers have marginalized minority communities, exposing them \nto “an unequal burden of air pollution and the concomitant adverse health effects.” The complaint is now \nunder negotiation with the City. Mediation could result in a process for a community-specific air quality \nmonitoring program, a cumulative air impacts ordinance, and an environmental justice ordinance.\nAfter President Trump eliminated the Obama-era Methane Rule for oil and gas operations on federal \nland, Governor Lujan Grisham established an Advisory Panel to clarify technical issues associated with \nan eventual state methane rule. The Law Center was represented on the panel, which issued a techni-\ncal report at the end of 2019, and we will help draft the new rule and ensure effective public comment.\nWATER\nAs part of the Trump administration’s war against environmental and health regulation, the US Environ-\nmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a change to the “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) \nRule, which defines what waters are protected by the federal Clean Water Act. The Law Center wrote \nextensive comments on the proposed rule. In early January 2020, the EPA published the final rule, un-\nder which the vast majority of surface waters in the state will lose all federal protection against pollution. \nThe Law Center is likely to join one of the many law suits that will be filed in this matter. (Clients: Amigos \nBravos & Gila Resources Information Project).\nResidents pack the Upper Pecos Watershed Association office in June 2019 to discuss the Tererro mine. Photo: NMELC staff\nIn May, we sent a Notice of Intent (NOI) to sue to the US Air Force over its handling of groundwater contam-\nination from the bulk fuel leak at Kirtland Air Force Base. Discussions with the Air Force stalled and in \nFebruary 2020, the Law Center filed suit against the Air Force. In a separate case, the Law Center’s clients \nfiled an Amici Curiae – “Friends of the Court” – brief supporting the New Mexico Attorney General and the \nNew Mexico Environment Department litigation to get the Air Force to conduct prompt cleanup of per- and \npolyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at Cannon Air Force Base and Holloman Air Force Base. (Kirtland \nclients: SouthWest Organizing Project, New Mexico Voices for Children, State Senator Antoinette Sedillo \nLopez, State Senator Mimi Stewart, State Representative G. Andres Romero, and three individual residents \nof the impacted area; PFAS clients: the above three state legislators).\nThanks to your support, we have had success with an issue that will become more common as climate \nchange affects surface water availability: groundwater withdrawal permit applications. In January, a State \nDistrict Court judge denied the groundwater pumping application of Aquifer Science in the East Mountain \narea of Albuquerque. The judge ruled that over 100 domestic wells would be impaired by the proposed \npumping and – importantly – that the Applicant and the Office of the State Engineer (OSE) did not consider \nclimate change science and the impact of future drought. In a subsequent ruling on cost recovery, a judge \nfound that the OSE was liable for part of the cost for expert witness fees and related costs. Both Aquifer Sci-\nence and the OSE have appealed. Our clients won another victory in the 12-year struggle against Augustin \nPlains Ranch (APR) for a State Engineer permit to withdraw 17 billion gallons of groundwater annually. \nBoth APR and the OSE have appealed. New Mexico Copper Corporation (NMCC) sought to acquire water \nrights for use at a proposed copper mine near Hillsboro, NM. A December 2017 court decision on the Cop-\nper Flat Mine Water Rights Adjudication significantly limited the amount of water available to the mine. In \nApril 2019, we filed a cross-appeal, arguing that the original decision needed to go further and find that the \nclaimants have no available water rights. (Aquifer Science clients; more than 50 individuals; Agustin Plains \nRanch clients: nearly 100 ranchers, farmers & other property holders; Copper Flat Water clients: Hillsboro \nMutual Domestic Water Users Association).\nWe appealed the Water Quality Control Commission’s (WQCC) newly adopted Water Quality Act Variance \nRule with the New Mexico Court of Appeals, arguing that the new rule violates several aspects of the New \nMexico Water Quality Act, in part by limiting public participation and by granting variances in perpetuity. \n(Clients: Amigos Bravos & Gila Resources Information Project).\nIn June, the Water Quality Control Commission (WQCC) sup-\nported our Motion to Vacate and Remand the Petition for \nReview of groundwater discharge permit DP-1132 for Los \nAlamos National Laboratory's (LANL) Radioactive Liquid \nWaste Treatment Facility. The Motion was based on the fact \nthat the Hearing Officer, at the time of the hearing on the \npermit, had a job application at LANL and subsequently was \nhired by the Lab. We are also nearing the end of a case in-\nvolving the 2005 Consent Order between the NMED and \nLANL management. Under the Order, LANL missed multiple deadlines and accrued potentially $300 \nmillion in fines. Governor Martinez’ Environment Department adopted a new Consent Order in 2016 that \nlacked deadlines or enforcement mechanisms for cleanup. We sued and a federal District Court judge al-\nlowed the case to move forward, including possible civil penalties, stating that neither the Department of \nEnergy nor Lab management had been able to document that violations had stopped or that they would \nnot occur in the future.

Our staff now numbers eleven, all working to protect New Mexico’s air, land, \nwater and communities.\nAs you will read in our Top 10 Stories of 2018, we and our clients achieved a significant victory \nin the Augustin Plains Ranch water grab case, protecting millions of gallons of drinking water \nfrom being siphoned off for private gain. On the other hand, there was a hard defeat in the NM \nSupreme Court on the Copper Rule – allowing pollution of groundwater below any copper \nmine in the state – and a setback when the Mt. Taylor uranium mine “return to operational” \npermit was granted. Other cases are progressing.\nThank you for your continued support,  \nwhich makes all this work possible.\nYours truly,\nDouglas Meiklejohn \nExecutive Director\n2018\nNMELC Annual Report\nLaw Center Board of Directors  \n(Current)\nRamon Padilla, President, Las Cruces\nJuan Reynosa, Vice President, Albuquerque\nStuart Bluestone, Secretary, Santa Fe\nHarry Browne, Treasurer, Silver City\nJohana Bencomo, Las Cruces\nMichael Casaus, Albuquerque\nEileen Gauna, Albuquerque\nSusanne Hoffman-Dooley, Santa Fe\nDonna House, Ohkay Owingeh\nRenee Ingold, Fallbrook, CA\nLaw Center Staff  \n(Current)\nOffice dogs Arlo, Brisa, Lulu\nJon M.

The Ranch has appealed the decision. (Clients: nearly 100 ranchers, farmers, & other property \nowners; attorneys: Douglas Meiklejohn & Jaimie Park).\nSantolina Proposed Development – Our \nclients have appealed the Level A Master \nPlan to the Court of Appeals and the Level \nB1 plan to District Court. The developer, \nWestern Albuquerque Land Holdings, has \nnot met the requirement to show where it will \nget water for the projected 90,000 residents on \nthe West Mesa. The Albuquerque Bernalillo \nCounty Water Utility Authority has not made \na commitment to provide water and sewer \nservices and has advised the developers that \nsubstantial infrastructure needs to be built to \nuse recycled water for water service. (Clients: \nSouthWest Organizing Project, NM Health Equity Working Group, Center for Social Sustainable \nSystems, neighborhood & acequia associations, several individuals; attorneys: Douglas Meiklejohn \n& Jaimie Park).\nCopper Mine Rule – The New Mexico Supreme Court upheld the Copper Mine Rule. The Rule sets \nthe “point of compliance” with water quality standards outside a mine pit’s area of open hydrolog-\nic containment. This “strategic containment” is contrary to the Water Quality Act’s purpose of pre-\nventing and abating water pollution. Other industries see the \nRule as a model for easing permitting and reducing opportu-\nnities for public participation. (Clients: Amigos Bravos, Gila \nResources Information Project; attorneys: Douglas Meiklejohn \n& Jaimie Park).\nCopper Flat Copper Mine – Copper Flat is the first cop-\nper mine permit process under the Copper Rule. The state \nEnvironment Department (NMED) granted a groundwa-\nter discharge permit and our clients petitioned the Water \nQuality Control Commission (WQCC) for a review. Separately, the Mining & Minerals Division \n(MMD) held a mine operating permit hearing. Our clients oppose the three regulatory require-\nments remaining for a mine permit: 1) an NMED Determination that permitted activities will \ncomply with environmental standards; 2) approved financial assurance; and 3) Bureau of Land \nManagement approval of the proposed mining operation. (Clients: Turner Ladder Ranch, Hillsboro \nPitchfork Ranch, Gila Resources Information Project; attorneys: Charles de Saillan & Jaimie Park).\nMt. Taylor Mine – The Mining Commission approved the Mt. Taylor Mine “return to operational” \npermit. The decision essentially means anything a mining company does that “disturbs” the land \nis mining and that “mining” does not require ore extraction. The mine was in its 19th year of \n“standby” status and would have had to begin reclamation in late 2019. The decision allows the \nmine’s owner, Rio Grande Resources, to avoid mine reclamation. Our clients have appealed the \ndecision to the 1st Judicial District Court. (Clients: Amigos Bravos, the Multicultural Alliance for a \nSafe Environment; attorney: Eric Jantz).\n4  5\nLos Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Consent Order – A US District Court judge ruled that \nthe portion of our client’s lawsuit seeking penalties can go forward. Our clients had sued LANL \nmanagement and the Department of Energy (DOE) over repeated violations of the 2005 Consent \nOrder on cleanup, accruing $272 million in possible fines. In allowing the case to proceed, the \njudge noted that the DOE and LANL management had not proven that violations would not con-\ntinue. (Client: Nuclear Watch New Mexico; attorney: Jon Block).\nLANL Discharge Permits – It was a busy year for discharge permits at LANL. Our client, \nCommunities for Clean Water (CCW), received a hearing on groundwater discharge permit (DP) \n1793, which regulates disposal of wastewater generated by the monitoring and cleanup of chro-\nmium, RDX, and perchlorate in the drinking water aquifer under LANL and the Pueblo of San \nIldefonso. The hearing resulted from a 2017 Court of Appeals decision for \nour clients that NMED and the WQCC violated the Water Quality Act in \npreviously denying a public hearing on the permit. CCW also challenged \nDP-1132, which regulates the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility \n(RLWTF), arguing that because there is no discharge from the facility, \na permit under the Water Quality Act is inappropriate and the facility \nshould be regulated as a hazardous waste site under the more stringent \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The case is on appeal to the WQCC. In a sepa-\nrate case, Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety (a member of CCW) asked Region 6 of the EPA \nto remove the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) discharge permit for \nOutfall 051 from the RLWTF because there is no longer a discharge. Region 6 refused, as did the \nEPA Environmental Appeals Board. The case is now at the federal 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. \n(Attorney: Jon Block).\nSunport Extension/Woodward Improvements – Mayor Keller withdrew Albuquerque’s sup-\nport for the Sunport Boulevard Extension west across I-25 down to Broadway. That project and \nthe Woodward project from Broadway to 2nd Street are almost entirely within the City. In July, \nour clients submitted comments on Bernalillo County’s third Environmental Assessment, arguing \nthe EA did not meet Federal Highway Administration requirements and that the County, which \nis pushing the projects, failed to address air quality-related health impacts. (Clients: SouthWest \nOrganizing Project, Steven & Esther Abeyta; attorney: Jon Block).\nSouth Valley Air Quality Issues – Our clients filed a Petition for a hearing with the Albuquerque-\nBernalillo Air Quality Control Board on yet another air quality permit in the South Valley, this \ntime for a hot mix asphalt plant. The Board has refused in the past to consider cumulative impacts \non air quality when making permit decisions. In 2016, the EPA agreed to investigate a federal \nTitle VI civil rights complaint our clients filed claiming a disproportionate burden on low-income \ncommunities and communities of color. The investigation has been on hold pending the Board’s \ndecision on engaging in mediation with our client. (Clients: SouthWest Organizing Project, Esther \n& Steven Abeyta, Mountain View Neighborhood Association, Nora Garcia; attorney: Eric Jantz).\n Water Quality Rule Changes – NMED filed a petition to amend Water \nQuality Act regulations with the WQCC, which adopted a new ground-\nwater discharge rule granting variances in perpetuity. Variances allow \nfacilities to avoid compliance with regulations and had been limited to \nfive years. The new rule eliminates the mandatory public notice and \npublic hearing on a variance every five years. Our clients appealed \nthe decision to the Court of Appeals. NMED withdrew another pro-\nposed rule change to allow “minor changes” to permits without pub-\nlic notice or a hearing. “Minor” changes could include significant \npermit information such as change in discharge location, increase in \ndischarge volume, and change in discharge quality.

It finally obtained that permit in 2013, which led the Law Center and its clients to challenge the City/County Air Quality Control Board for failing to take into account “cumulative air quality impacts” (how all of the air pollution in the neighborhood affects residents – not just the emissions from one facility) and therefore failing to uphold their mandate under the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act to ‘prevent or abate air pollution.’ The City Environmental Health Department claims it is too poor to monitor air quality in the neighborhood, yet spent more than $100,000 on attorneys and experts to challenge our clients. An appeal hearing was held in early 2017. In June 2018, Honstein relocated to Broadway Blvd SE and submitted a modified permit for double the annual throughput.\nLATEST NEWS:\n04/22/2019 – Albuquerque Environmental health Department approved Honstein’s permit modification\n03/14/2019 & 03/21/2019 – The Environmental Health Department held a Public Roundtable (3/14) and a Public Information meeting (3/21) on the Honstein permit modification\n09/2062018 – Honstein filed a permit modification with the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department.

Rio Grande Resources received its first Standby permit in 1999. Under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act, operators are allowed a maximum of 20 years in Standby status through up to 4 permits of 5 years maximum each. Standby allows an operator to temporarily halt production without having to close and cleanup its mine while waiting for conditions to improve so production can start again. The operator is supposed to prevent contamination from leaving the mine site, but the Mt Taylor mine continues to leak contamination into groundwater. This case is significant because of the culturally-sensitive lands that the mine impacts and because it includes a potentially precedent-setting test of how the Mining Act is enforced against “zombie” mines – mines that are neither operational nor cleaning up. In December 2019, Rio Grande Resources suddenly announced it was closing the mine and would move to remediate the site.\nLATEST NEWS:\n03/25/2020 – The NM Court of Appeals denied our clients’ petition for a writ for certiorari (request to review a lower court decision) regarding the District Court’s ruling on our appeal of the Mining Commission decision to allow Mt Taylor mine to return to active status. Even though Rio Grande Resources has decided to close the mine, the case raised important issues about the process for mines going into “standby” status and coming back into “active” status\n12/03/2019 – In a surprise move, Rio Grande Resources notified the Mining and Minerals Division that it was closing the Mt Taylor mine and would son begin reclamation procedures. Read our press release.\n02/28/2019 – We filed our Statement of Appellate Issues with the First Judicial District Court\n08/24/2018 – Our clients appealed the Mining Commission decision to the First Judicial District Court\n07/27/2018 – The Mining Commission issued its Final Order explaining the basis for its July 2017 decision to uphold the return to active permit for the Mt Taylor mine. The Order allowed a mining permit even when no actual ore production will take place. The Law Center and its clients, MASE and Amigos Bravos, issued a statement commenting on the Commission’s decision.\n07/17/2018 – The Mining Commission upheld the Active permit; John Heaton, Chair of the Commission, was forced to recuse himself after public comment at the hearing revealed a conflict of interest because of his leading role in promoting the Holtec interim nuclear waste storage facility in SE New Mexico.\n02/28/2018 – MASE & Amigos Bravos filed a Petition for Review of the permit approval.

He saw first-hand, month after month, that MobilOil could not clean up the water that it polluted with the process.\nWhen he learned that Hydro Resources, Inc. sought to open a new ISL mine near his home, he organized his neighbors into the Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM – see videos below from two ENDAUM members). Two years later, in 1996, they approached the New Mexico Environmental Law Center for legal assistance. We have represented ENDAUM ever since.\nIt’s been an historic case, with work at the local, state, national and international levels. The stakes are high: the Westwater Canyon Aquifer currently supplies approximately 15,000 residents of the Eastern Agency of the Navajo Nation. In addition, the tribal water planners declared that the aquifer will be an important future source of water to meet growing demands in the future. The mines and processing plant would also add radioactive air emissions to an airshed that already exceeds federal air quality standards for radiation.\n“If these mines succeed in opening, it will send a chilling message to communities near uranium ore: uranium is worth more than your water … more than your air … more than you and your neighbors.”\nAT STAKE:\nMillions of gallons of potential drinking water.\nChristine’s Fight Against Uranium Mining\n“It’s not over.” 13 Years Fighting Uranium in NM\nWatch the ENDAUM v.

It would require nearly 20 million gallons of water per day, at least 20 schools, and two interchanges on I-40. Unfortunately, politicians have approved Santolina’s first level of approvals – despite the fact that developers have failed to show where they will get their water and how they will construct this massive undertaking without cost to Bernalillo taxpayers. “Santolina” is a complex set of cases related to different levels of the planning approval process. Cases involve: the Zone Map Amendment; the Level A Master Plan (Level A is the entire 13,000 acre site); the Level B.1 master plan (the B level is for discrete parts of the overall development covering several thousand acres); the Development Agreement for provision of water and wastewater. These cases are in various stages in District Court and the state Court of Appeals.\nLATEST NEWS:\nUpdates are organized based on the planning issue involved; a couple of the updates cover multiple issues – for example, updates on 12/21/2015 and 05/04/2016 under the Level A Master Plan deal with court filings covering the Zone Map, the Level A Master Plan, and the Development Agreement.\nZone Map Amendment\n06/06/2017 – NMELC files Motion for Clarification and Memorandum in Support of Motion for Clarification.

It wants more than 17 billion gallons of publicly owned water and has never said what it will do with it, except sell it to someone, somewhere, for something. We persuaded the State Engineer to deny the application in 2012, and then persuaded a state District Court judge to rule against the Ranch’s appeal. On August 1, 2018, the State Engineer denied the most recent application as speculative. If we do not stop this privatization scheme once and for all, the precedent it would set could dry up rural communities throughout New Mexico.\nLatest News:\n07/25/2019 – The 7th State Judicial District Court granted our Motion for Summary Judgment in Augustin Plains Ranch’s appeal of the August 2018 denial of its application by the State Engineer. Catron County had also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which the judge also granted. Motions from the Ranch and the State Engineer were not considered once our Motion was granted. Judge Reynolds’ ruling was based on his finding that he had already decided the issues presented by this Augustin Plains Ranch application when he denied the application filed by the Ranch in 2007 and 2008.

An estimated 24 million gallons of jet fuel is migrating through Albuquerque’s aquifer towards one of the City’s biggest drinking water well fields. The Air Force ignored indications as far back as the early 1980s that there might be a problem with its underground fuel system until 1999, when it became painfully obvious. After 20 years, the Air Force has yet to fully delineate the plume of groundwater contamination and a final remedy has neither been evaluated nor implemented. There is no written work plan for completing the investigation or implementing cleanup of the groundwater contamination and no written schedule or enforceable milestone deadlines for doing so …if we are not successful in winning speedier, more effective cleanup, there may be no urgency until drinking water wells start becoming contaminated.\nLATEST NEWS:\n02/03/2020 – Our clients filed a Complaint against the U.S. Air Force and the Department of Defense. Following our Notice of Intent to Sue in May 2019, we began discussions with the Air Force and sent them a draft consent decree, containing a cleanup schedule and potential penalties for failure to meet cleanup milestones.

On the mining side, the Bureau of Land Management has to complete an environmental impact statement (EIS) because part of the proposed mine site is on federal land. New Mexico Copper Corporation submitted a mine operating permit application to the Mining and Minerals Division and a groundwater discharge permit application to the NM Environment Department. Those applications had hearings in September and October 2018. The main issue with this proposed mine is its potential impact to ground and surface water quality and quantity in Sierra County.\nLATEST NEWS:\n10/22/2018 – There is a hearing Oct 23-4 (possibly extended in to Oct 25-6) on the Mining & Minerals Division mine operating permit for Copper Flat Mine.

The SWP is supposed to be a strategic management tool that provides the Legislature, water managers, and the regional planning districts with a clear vision and policy direction for managing the state’s waters. In June 2018, the ISC released a draft State Water Plan update for public comment. The Law Center staff and Board reviewed the draft SWP, found it fundamentally flawed, and decided to devote resources to provide extensive comments on the SWP with the hope of improving the Plan so that it can provide the vision and direction the State and its communities need to build a more resilient water management future.\nLATEST NEWS:\n08/24/2018 – The Law Center filed comments on the draft State Water Plan. Amigos Bravos, a client of the Law Center on several cases (but not on the State Water Plan), also filed comments; included are two attachments: one is a draft 2016 report on the Water-Energy Nexus in New Mexico (the final version will come out soon) and the other is a report on how agencies can promote community participation. Santa Clara Pueblo filed comments.\n08/17/2018 – The Law Center posted draft Talking Points ahead of its final comments to the ISC.\n07/09/2018 – The Interstate Stream Commission released its draft update of the State Water Plan (SWP) for public comment. The public comment period was extended to August 25, 2018. The SWP is in three volumes: Part I: Policies, which is a very general listing of unranked goals and strategies; Part II: Technical Report, which is the most important part of the SWP, despite its title; Part III: Legal Landmarks, which is a useful overview of the legal basis for water planning in New Mexico.\n12/13-14/2017 – State Water Planning Town Hall, “Advancing New Mexico’s Water Future”, attended by over 200 people from across the state. The Town Hall was convened by the Interstate Stream Commission and facilitated by New Mexico First.

King of Church Rock once worked in the mines that line the Rio Puerco between Red Water Pond Road Community and Church Rock. The United Nuclear spill of 1979 into the Rio Puerco – the largest accidental release of radiation in US history – surged through the land that he and his family call home. He joined ENDAUM in its early days, and has become a leader in the fight to prevent new uranium mining in Diné communities. Following are excerpts from a video interview with Larry.\n“When I first joined in 1997, I didn’t see myself twenty years down the road, or even several years later, working on this. I thought maybe it would be resolved in three years – no more than 10 years. But twenty years later, we’re still here. It’s a long and hideous process. A lot of sleepless nights. A lot of worries.”\n“Our organization, with the help of the Law Center and other groups, was able to educate our elected Tribal officials and our President at the time… We were also successful in getting a Navajo Nation law passed to ban uranium mining in Navajo Country.”\n“A total ban on new uranium mining… and cleanup. Compensate the workers [who worked in the industry after 1971 who do not qualify for the federal Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]. That would be justice.”\n“Advice for communities just starting a fight against a big polluter: be persistent, be vigilant, don’t give up. Your first target would be your elected officials. Target them, educate them. From there, once you get all of those people on your side, it’s easy.”\n“If the Law Center disappeared…that would be a huge, tremendous loss. We’d have to start from ground zero. I would be forever in shock because the companies that we’ve been so far lucky to keep away from our communities, once they found out, they would come charging in. That would be a huge catastrophe.”", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "d3dfd457392c0afe2e69a791e35a4bdd1b6eef0e270bca6346c21b071e169ead", "out_path": "raw/html/https_nmelc.org_2017_12_14_larrys-story.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

Imagine driving there and back just so you could talk to the people who will decide what happens in your backyard. That’s what Maria Elena Bejarano and Betty Gonzalez did just to be a part of the public process and to have their voice heard. They wanted to tell those people what it’s like to live near a mega-dairy with hundreds of cows just across the road.\nThey were the only community members available to go to the public hearing back in the Spring, but the dairies, “they’re well represented at these meetings,” says Betty. Other community members, Maria Elena explains, “are concerned, but they feel they can’t do anything. That’s one of the basic things that I hear from them: ‘What can we do? They got more than what we can fight them with.’”\n“Most meetings take place in Albuquerque or Santa Fe,” says Betty, “and we are at the southern end of the state. Trying to get people to go up there…it’s hard. We don’t have the resources. When we go, we make the trip all in one day. We take our own car, we pay for our own gas, you know? But we feel that it’s…”\n“…important enough,” says Maria Elena.\nOther community members, Maria Elena explains, “are concerned, but they feel they can’t do anything. That’s one of the basic things that I hear from them: ‘What can we do? They got more than what we can fight them with.’”\nThese women, both proud grandmothers, have been living in this community for over thirty years each. They moved here to Anthony to be close to their families, to raise their children in a rural environment and have them close to their generational roots. Their neighborhood wasn’t always such a hard place to live. “When I moved here in 1978, I didn’t even know there was a dairy,” says Maria Elena. “It didn’t smell. Then they started increasing the number of cows and that’s what caused it to get bad.”\n“I will be here,” pointing to her kitchen sink, “peeling chiles, washing dishes, all that good stuff and there it is,” the overwhelming stench of manure. Maria Elena goes on to explain how the flies got so bad last year. “One time my cousin came over and out of three doors she didn’t know where to come in. It was just packed with flies. They were on everything.”\n“That’s the thing,” adds Betty. “We can’t enjoy anything outside.”\nThe Del Oro Dairy is about 600 feet from Maria Elena’s home and stretches about a half mile long. It is one of several mega-dairies in the area and is one of the smaller operations. A short drive down Interstate 10 past Las Cruces shows why the area is called “Dairy Row”.\nLaw Center Attorney Jon Block represents Rio Valle Concerned Citizens in its efforts to get existing groundwater contamination along Dairy Row cleaned up. Rio Valle Concerned Citizens is also working with the Law Center and other communities around New Mexico that are impacted by dairies to protect the existing “Dairy Rule,” which was adopted in 2010. The Dairy Industry has tried to overturn it since 2011 and has now petitioned the Water Quality Control Commission to gut it.\n“We want to know that our well water is going to be protected,” says Betty. “Everything depends on water, so we’ve GOT to do something.”\n“We’re trying,” says Maria Elena.\nWhen thinking back on the time spent living with swarms of flies and the smell, Maria Elena reflects…", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "077caa96c771e755c26f16a901f9572379fa15145cc45f523853559e4a8e81a2", "out_path": "raw/html/https_nmelc.org_2014_10_14_maria-elena-and-betty-story.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

Since May 14, the federal government has placed four New Mexico uranium mining projects on a national priority list, with three of them flagged for expedited permitting.\nMining projects in the region, shuttered since the end of the Cold War, carry a tarnished legacy: spiking cancer rates in the region and contaminated local aquifers, according to the Environmental Protection Agency — contamination that some people contend has not yet been cleaned up.\nNow, after 50 years, mining projects are back on the table, as the White House looks to New Mexico uranium to anchor a domestic supply chain.\nTogether, the New Mexico projects targeted by the current administration could generate over 500 jobs, at least $400 million in local economic impact and a 30-year domestic uranium supply, the mining companies estimate.\nNorthwestern New Mexico is a historic leader in uranium mining, producing more than any other district during the Cold War, according to data by the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. The agency estimates the region to be the seventh in total world uranium production, behind East Germany, the Athabasca Basin in Canada, Australia, South Africa, Russia and Kazakhstan.\nBut since the Cold War’s end, the U.S. has tilted its uranium portfolio toward foreign imports. As of 2023, nearly 99% of uranium used in nuclear energy generators was imported, data from the U.S. Energy Administration shows.\nThe four mining projects that have been highlighted by the White House to “advance President Trump’s bold agenda to make America energy dominant again,” according to a recent executive order, are: the Grants Precision In Situ Recovery Project, added on May 14; La Jara Mesa and Roca Honda, two more uranium mining projects near Grants, added to the list on May 22; and the Crownpoint and Church Rock uranium mines — near the Navajo Nation, added May 30.\nDon’t miss the latest Albuquerque business headlines! Sign up here for ABF newsletters and make sure to download the app.\nInclusion on the list places the projects on a federal permitting dashboard, tracking progress and streamlining communication between stakeholders, which is expected to expedite the permitting process.\nOne project that was formerly on the list, Utah’s Velvet-Wood mine near Moab, was permitted in a record 11 days in response to a “national energy emergency,” declared by President Trump. The Utah mine produces a fraction of New Mexico’s uranium deposits.\n‘Mine,’ or yours?\nDespite placement on the list, some of the mining projects still must win state permitting approval — a process that could take years — and requires extensive review by the New Mexico Mining Minerals Division (NMMMD). The agency also reviews the projects’ reclamation plans, which determine mine cleanup after the minerals have been extracted.\nThe federal permitting process does coordinate, and thereby, expedites, U.S. Forest Service and National Environmental Protection Agency permitting, according to Kim Casey, Investor Relations manager at Energy Fuels Inc, the company in the process of permitting the La Roca Honda mine.\nBut, “Even with the federal fast-tracking, the state of New Mexico has indicated that it will require the same processes it always has, and will rigorously review all permit applications,” said Maslyn Locke, senior attorney at the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, in an email exchange with Business First. “On (the) Navajo Nation, for example, under the Diné Natural Resources Protection Act, new uranium mining is not allowed on tribal land. Any attempt to do so would likely be challenged.”\nAnother challenge could be that some of the mining projects would require transporting uranium or mining equipment over Navajo lands, which is forbidden by a statute enacted in 2012, said Stephen Etsitty, executive director of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protections Agency in an interview with Business First. Other Navajo statutes include a moratorium on mining and processing uranium on Navajo lands.\nRead more.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "33b022613ebee8ae70a1f1a80c3406a2ffd4a6023637976dd9d8ca769d9fcc2d", "out_path": "raw/html/https_nmelc.org_2025_06_26_high-priority-new-mexico-uranium-mining-projects-get-federally-fast-tracked-amid-push-for-us-energy-security.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

This is especially true in states trying to meet growing energy demands driven largely by artificial intelligence and data centers. In many cases, states are setting their sights on small modular reactors, or SMRs, which have a smaller physical footprint compared with large reactors and can potentially come online sooner.\nThese developments mean the U.S. will need a reliable supply of uranium, a key element in the production of nuclear fuel. With uranium exports from Russia, one of the main suppliers of the mineral to the U.S., diminished by the Russia-Ukraine war, the U.S. is seeking alternative sources of uranium for its 54 reactors.

The Sunland Park and Santa Teresa Community facilities each tested below the Environmental Protection Agency maximum contaminate level for arsenic of 10 parts per billion (ppb), according to a CRRUA news release.\nThe utlity has been conducting voluntary monthly testing of its treatment facilities since February 2024 through Eurofins Environment Testing; an independent water lab certified by the New Mexico Environment Department. According to CRRUA, the Industrial Park facility sample was collected on April 23 and showed 12 ppb.\nCRRUA executive director Juan Crosby insisted the water was safe to drink.\n“When we received the test results for the Santa Teresa Industrial ATF, we immediately implemented protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs) we initiated in partnership with NMED, and adjusted treatment that lowered the arsenic level to below the MCL,” Crosby said in a news release. “At no time was the public health at risk. The water continues to meet NMED and EPA standards and is safe to consume.”\nCrosby said CRRUA will conduct additional tests on May 13 and May 20.\nWhile the failed test was a voluntary test, CRRUA has passed NMED’s 2025 first quarter arsenic test and has passed four quarterly tests by the state.\nThe utility recently announced it had addressed all but three deficiencies identified by the NMED in a 2023 sanitary survey.\nYet Sunland Park and Santa Teresa residents continue to express concerns over water quality.\nIn a May 9 letter to the CRRUA board, the Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County called for the establishment of a citizen advisory committee that consists of Santa Teresa and Sunland Park community members rather than CRRUA officials or staff.\n“The Committee serves to aid and ensure CRRUA meets its public duty to provide consumers with clean, safe, and affordable water and wastewater services,” the letter read.\n“However, if the Committee is primarily composed of CRRUA’s own staff, Board members, and supporters, it is highly unlikely that the Committee can effectively fulfill its purpose and address the needs of Sunland Park and Santa Teresa community members. To create a Citizen Advisory Committee that is not reflective of the communities CRRUA serves is, instead, yet another way in which CRRUA continues to fail to honestly build trust with the communities CRRUA has historically and continuously harmed.”\nRead more.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "79bb6ee52a626cf2c037a2ac9e9a0544444f8870b7c1912055250d0c18501e11", "out_path": "raw/html/https_nmelc.org_2025_05_13_crrua-reports-santa-teresa-treatment-facility-fails-arsenic-test.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

We continue to be the only public interest nonprofit law centerin New Mexico focused on environmental justice legal work and one of few acrossthe nation representing clients fighting against the toxic legacy of uranium mining. \nAlthough the work of NMELC has always been instrumental in advancing anddemanding justice, the current historical moment has made our legal serviceseven more critical and urgently needed. \nSince January 20, on an almost daily basis, we continue to witness attacks wieldedagainst our democracy, on our human rights, and the unjust targeting of communitieswho have already faced great oppression in our country. This targeting has beenrelentless and is personal because it includes our families, neighbors, allies, clients,and nonprofits.\nThe reality we are facing feels grim under this administration with extractive miningbeing prioritized and fast tracked with minimal environmental review; with nonprofitstatuses being scrutinized and questioned; with the possible repeal of environmentalregulations meant to protect us; among others.

Part 7,\nprohibit the City of Albuquerque and its City Council, as recipients of federal funding, from discriminating against individuals\non the basis of race, color, or national origin. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the City violated Coalition members’ civil\nrights when the City Council passed legislation in an unlawful attempt to purge the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality\nControl Board and place a moratorium on the Board’s ability to take action during the HEEI rulemaking hearing. \nThe Mountain View Coalition asked EPA to: \n1) Conduct an investigation into the City of Albuquerque and its City Council’s discriminatory conduct and interference in the\nHEEI Rulemaking; 2) Hold a public listening session and an opportunity for community members to submit comments on the\nCity’s discriminatory actions; 3) If warranted, reduce or eliminate federal funding for the City of Albuquerque; and 4) Take all\nother actions to ensure that the City and its Council come into and remain in Compliance with Title VI. \nOn January 17, 2025, EPA accepted the Civil Rights Complaint for investigation to determine, “whether the actions of the City\nCouncil surrounding the Air Board’s rulemaking proceeding and issuance of the HEEI Rule discriminated against persons in\nAlbuquerque on the basis of race, color and national origin, in violation of Title VI …” This decision by EPA was great news\nfor community members and a small but important environmental justice victory.\nSince the promulgation of the Health, Environment and Equity Impacts (HEEI) Rule in December 2023, members of the\nMountain View Coalition, made up of the Mountain View Neighborhood Association, Mountain View Community Action and\nFriends of Valle de Oro, along with NMELC, continue to fight for environmental justice and clean air in Albuquerque and\nBernalillo County. \nAs we’ve previously shared, what started out as one rulemaking has proliferated into three district court lawsuits, two cases in\nthe Court of Appeals, multiple civil rights complaints and continuous engagement with the City of Albuquerque\nEnvironmental Health Department (EHD) and its implementation of the rule.\nMountain View Coalition/HEEI Title VI Complaint\nCASE UPDATES\nBY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & KACEY\nHOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY \n\n\nThe Mountain View Coalition, through an Inspection of Public Records Act request, obtained the City’s response to MVC’s\nComplaint, in which the City makes several frivolous arguments, ultimately claiming that EPA cannot investigate the Council for\nits discriminatory acts because it is inexplicably not required to comply with civil rights laws. But the City of Albuquerque and its\nCity Council are not immune from, nor above, federal law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color and national\norigin. The Coalition has provided EPA with written comments supporting EPA’s authority to investigate the City and correcting\nthe City’s many incorrect factual assertions. \nThe Mountain View Coalition continues to engage with EPA to provide information that better informs the investigation of the\nCity of Albuquerque, and remains hopeful that EPA will issue a finding of discrimination against the City to ensure the City\ncomes into compliance with its obligation to respect community members’ civil rights. \nThe Coalition also submitted a Request for Compliance Review of EHD, asking EPA to thoroughly investigate and review\nEHD’s compliance with Title VI. EHD has an ongoing and extensive history of civil rights violations. During the HEEI\nproceedings, EHD discriminated against communities of color by failing to provide logistical support to the Air Board as the New\nMexico Air Quality Control Act requires and consistently collaborating with polluting industry to undermine the community’s\neffort to improve air quality. \nEHD was previously the subject of a similar Title VI Complaint filed in 2014, when community groups submitted a complaint as\na result of EHD’s failure to consider the cumulative impacts of health factors, social factors, and additional air pollution burdens\nin already overburdened areas and EHD’s pattern and practice of discriminatory air pollution permitting. EPA has also accepted\nan additional Title VI Complaint for investigation, filed on May 30, 2024 by community allies Los Jardines Institute and the\nNatural Resources Defense Council, for EHD’s discriminatory conduct during the HEEI rulemaking. \nOur legal work alongside the Mountain View Coalition is a fight against environmental racism and for stronger regulations to\nbetter protect community members’ health. \nIn addition to the lawsuits pending before the district court and the Civil Rights complaints, National Technology and Engineering\nSolutions of Sandia (NTESS), a subsidiary of Honeywell International and the contractor that operates Sandia National Lab, and a\ngroup of industry permittees, appealed the HEEI Rule the Air Board adopted to the New Mexico Court of Appeals. The industry\ngroups assert, among other things, that the Air Board did not have the authority to adopt the rule. The Mountain View Coalition\nintervened in the appeal of the HEEI Rule to defend the Rule’s validity. \nOn April 2, 2025, NMELC filed two Answer Briefs with the Court of Appeals, responding to both NTESS and a set of industry\ngroups, including Albuquerque Asphalt, Black Rock Services, Mountain States Construction and the New Mexico Chamber of\nCommerce. Both Answers support the Air Board’s authority to adopt the HEEI Rule, as well as clearly articulate the scientific and\ntechnical evidence supporting the requirements of the HEEI Rule itself. While some additional briefing may occur, the Mountain\nView Coalition now awaits a decision from the Court of Appeals and is hopeful the Court will uphold the Board’s decision to adopt\nthe HEEI Rule.\nMountain View Coalition/HEEI Appeals\nBY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & KACEY\nHOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY \n\nTwo weeks after EPA’s visit, however, CRRUA again provided residents with discolored water for days. Reports of poor water\nquality circulated from family homes and businesses alike, including the Sunland Park Senior Citizen Center.\nFollowing the latest water quality crisis, on March 7, NMELC, alongside community members and advocates, submitted a list of\nwritten demands to CRRUA, the City of Sunland Park, and Doña Ana County. The demands included that CRRUA establish\npreventive and protective measures in the event of impacted water quality; provide arsenic testing strips and clean third-party\nwater to all households; implement a rate increase moratorium for the next four years; and make CRRUA’s public meetings more\naccessible. Empowerment Congress, residents, and community advocates then made these demands clear at each public body’s\nmeetings in March, additionally requesting Doña Ana County Board Commissioner Gloria Gameros replace Commissioner\nShannon Reynolds on the CRRUA Board – which the County Board finalized on March 25. \nCommunity members and advocates continue to demand action, accountability, transparency, and change, and NMELC remains\ncommitted to working alongside our clients and community members in the fight for clean and safe drinking water. \nIn Southern New Mexico, Sunland Park and Santa Teresa residents, community advocates, a nonprofit organization called\nEmpowerment Congress, and NMELC continue to organize for consistently clean and safe drinking water. Following NMELC\nand community members’ October 2024 meeting with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), NMELC, on behalf\nof residents and community advocates, submitted a Formal Request to EPA to inspect the Camino Real Regional Utility\nAuthority (CRRUA) for compliance with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act on December 20, 2024. As a result, on February\n4, 2025, EPA conducted an on-site inspection of CRRUA, and we continue to wait for EPA’s release of its inspection report.\nSunland Park & Santa Teresa Water Quality Case\nBY KACEY HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY; ANN\nMCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY\nProposed Uranium Mining at La Jara Mesa/Roca Honda/\nCrownpoint/Churchrock\nBY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR & ANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY\nWith Executive Orders “unleashing” American energy “dominance” and directing the U.S. Department of Justice to evaluate state\nand local laws that might stand in the way of unregulated energy mineral exploitation, with the goal of filing lawsuits to overturn\nthose laws, communities that have struggled under the weight of historic uranium extraction are again in the crosshairs. Because\nDiné, Acoma, and Laguna communities are still contaminated from Cold War era mining, the federal government’s rush to\nexploit minerals it designates as “critical,” such as uranium, is particularly concerning. The federal Executive Orders are intended\nto significantly narrow public participation and input on uranium and other “critical” mineral projects.  \nThese unilateral executive actions, although likely illegal, could have significant effects on New Mexico communities. The\nExecutive Orders force federal agencies to cut corners with environmental, public health and cultural reviews and limit the ability\nof affected communities to take legal action in response. Proposed conventional uranium mining projects at La Jara Mesa\n(Laramide Resources) and Roca Honda (Energy Fuels) could be fast-tracked into development, while those projects’ effects on\nprecious water resources and Indigenous cultural values are minimized or ignored. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is\nlikely to greenlight proposed In Situ Leach uranium mining in the Diné communities of Churchrock and Crownpoint, which will\nput thousands of people’s future drinking water at risk.  \nFortunately, New Mexico has robust state laws to protect water and ensure that when mining occurs, it is done as responsibly as\npossible. Alongside our clients, NMELC will take every measure necessary to ensure communities are protected from the\ndevastation that the uranium extraction industry has and will continue to cause. \n\n\nRed Water Pond Road Community/Quivira WasteRemoval Project\nBY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY;\nANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY\nHomestake Barrick Gold (Homestake) created a heavily contaminated uranium mill Superfund site five miles north of Milan, New\nMexico. The Homestake mill site is so contaminated that two federal agencies oversee the cleanup of the radioactive waste: the\nNuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the EPA. Homestake continues its incessant efforts to loosen or end the groundwater\ncleanup requirements imposed by the NRC and the EPA.  \nIn 2023, Homestake applied to have “alternate concentration limits” of radioactive uranium approved by the NRC, which would,\nif granted, significantly relax groundwater cleanup standards for uranium and other toxic heavy metals. Also, by expanding the\nland boundaries at which uranium contamination levels are measured, Homestake anticipates its groundwater contamination will\nspread and hopes to extend its “point of compliance” with New Mexico groundwater standards as far as it can. To support its\napplication, Homestake bought land and homes from private landowners downgradient of the mill site, essentially forcing them\nout of the area so Homestake could more quickly cease its groundwater cleanup efforts. Many landowners sold to Homestake\nbecause of economic pressures and the ongoing presence and long term reality of contaminated groundwater from the mill site. In\naddition to its attempt with the NRC to abdicate responsibility for the contamination, Homestake also seeks an EPA waiver of its\nstandards by asserting it is “technically impractical” to clean up the groundwater to EPA’s current requirements. \nThe Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment (MASE) community and the remaining landowners continue their unwavering\nadvocacy and scrutiny of these two applications and the studies being conducted by Homestake to support its attempts to lower or\nend the NRC and EPA cleanup standards. \nWhen the U.S. EPA announced at the end of 2024 that it would be removing the waste from the historic Quivira uranium mine\nout of the Red Water Pond Road community to a properly engineered site at the Red Rock Landfill property, community\nmembers were thrilled. For the first time, the federal government had listened to a uranium impacted community’s wishes and\nagreed to move waste offsite rather than bury it in place. However, as the New Year wore on, Red Water Pond Road community\nmembers realized their fight wasn’t over.  \nDuring New Mexico’s legislative session, Senator George Muñoz introduced legislation that would have prevented the New\nMexico state agencies from granting necessary permits to the Red Rock Landfill for mine waste disposal. Uranium impacted\ncommunities from around the state turned out to testify against the proposed legislation, and during a committee hearing on\nMuñoz’s bill, were stunned to learn the bill was drafted and introduced on behalf of the Navajo Nation who had previously\npurported to support the uranium-impacted residents’ request. Rather than honor the will of its own people, the Navajo Nation\nattempted to stop mine waste relocation in favor of “treating” the mine waste with experimental technology that could allegedly\nbenefit the Navajo Nation financially.  \nVocal opposition led the committee to table Senator Muñoz’s bill, but community members now have a renewed sense of\nvigilance to stave off threats from the uranium mining industry, industry allies in the New Mexico government and their own\ntribal government. The EPA recently confirmed it intends to move forward with the mine waste removal plans. The Red Water\nPond Road community, with the NMELC’s support, will continue to make sure the Quivira Mine waste is removed from its\ncommunity and stored in a facility that protects the air, land and water of all communities.\nHomestake/Barrick Gold Mill Waste Cleanup\nBY ANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY & ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR \n\nCLIENT HIGHLIGHT\nLarry King, member of Eastern Navajo Diné Against UraniumMining (ENDAUM) at Navajo Nation Council protesting pro-uranium policies.

VIRGINIA NECOCHEA, \nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n\nJust north of Milan, the Homestake Uranium Mill, which closed in 1990, has left behind a total of 22 milliontons of uranium-laden waste, in two piles—both unlined and uncapped. One of them is a mile long and 400feet high. This mesa of highly toxic rubble has been seeping uranium and other contaminants intogroundwater for decades, forcing the residents of the area to leave their homes, family farms and ranches,because it was not safe to live there. This is yet another story of a community destroyed by the uraniumindustry.The Homestake Mill operated from 1958 until 1990, processing uranium ore into “yellow cake,” the form ofuranium usable for nuclear energy. It operated under a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC), which included a requirement that the contamination caused by the mill would be cleaned up afterthe mine closed. Water contamination from the uranium mill was first detected in 1961. In 1983, theHomestake Mill was placed on the National Priorities List, making it a Superfund Site. The EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) is responsible to ensure the clean up of Superfund Sites. So now, both the NRC andthe EPA have responsibility for the clean up. During the decades of so-called “clean up,” the contamination has become worse. What started as thecontamination of one aquifer—the shallow, Alluvial Aquifer—has grown into the contamination of fiveaquifers—the Alluvial, Upper Chinle, Middle Chinle, Lower Chinle, and even the pristine San Andres Aquifer.Not surprising, since Homestake Barrick Gold had been flushing the large tailings pile with water, pushingthe contamination out of the pile and into the ground and water below. Rather than applying the best science and technology and implementing a clean up plan that would actuallywork, Homestake Barrick Gold is now asking the EPA and the NRC to let them off the hook. They say theyhave tried and failed to clean up and they want to walk away from the mess they created.  We are workingwith our clients, the Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment (MASE), and the Blue Water ValleyDownstream Alliance, to try to convince the EPA and the NRC to hold Homestake Barrick Gold’s feet to thefire and to insist that their highly toxic massive mess is cleaned up. Our fresh water resources are far tooprecious to allow anything else.\nenvironmental racism should not be interpreted as a personal attack.  Talking openly about racism is aninvitation for all of us to confront this moment of racial reckoning and strive for transformation.I end this with the following question: What does this mean for people who want to support the movement,especially in this momentous time? It means listening and learning from the most impacted communities. Itmeans standing alongside communities in their demands for environmental justice. It means that we are willingto open our hearts and minds to real change and that we will take every opportunity to hold our leadersaccountable to those who have endured the most harm. It means that we will have the courage and the patienceto continue on this life-long path toward achieving true justice. \nI thank every one of you for your ongoing support of NMELC— we wouldn’t be here without you! We sincerelyhope that you continue the journey walking alongside us as we remain dedicated to providing high quality legalservices and support to communities across New Mexico who are fighting for environmental justice. \nIn solidarity,\nBY GAIL EVANS, STAFF ATTORNEY\nHomestake Barrick Gold Uranium Mill Superfund SiteCASE UPDATES\n\nBY DOUGLAS MEIKLEJOHN, STAFF ATTORNEY\nProposed Santolina Development Update\nFor the Law Center’s clients, the Law Center appealed those Board decisions to the District Court inAlbuquerque. The District Court: 1) affirmed the Board’s approval of the Level A Master Plan; 2) reversed theBoard’s approval of the zone map amendment; and 3) refused to review the Board’s approval of the SantolinaLevel A Development Agreement.\nThe Law Center appealed the District Court’s decision affirming the Board’s approval of the Level A MasterPlan and refusal to review the Board’s approval of the Development Agreement to the Court of Appeals.WALH and the Board appealed the District Court’s decision reversing the Board’s approval of the zone mapamendment to the Court of Appeals. \nIn December of 2020, the Court of Appeals affirmed all of the District Court rulings, which means that WALHdoes not have the zone map amendment that it needs for Santolina.   Recently WALH (joined by the Board)asked the State Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals' ruling invalidating the Board's approval of thezone map amendment. We are resisting WALH's effort. We also have asked the Supreme Court to review theCourt of Appeals’ rulings upholding the Board’s approval of the Master Plan and the Development Agreement.\nSecond set of cases\nThese cases involve the Board’s 2017 approval of the Santolina Level B.1 Master Plan and the Board’s 2018approval of the Santolina Level B.1 Development Agreement. On behalf of our clients, the Law Centerappealed these two Board decisions to the District Court, but the District Court affirmed those two Boarddecisions. Again on behalf of our clients, the Law Center appealed those District Court decisions to the StateCourt of Appeals. The cases have been briefed, and we are waiting for decisions by the Court of Appeals.\nThis involves two sets of cases. Kendra Palmer, JaimiePark, and I worked on the first set of cases, and KendraPalmer, Gail Evans and I are working on the second set ofcases.First set of casesIn 2015, the Bernalillo County Board of CountyCommissioners approved: 1) the zone map amendment sought by WesternAlbuquerque Land Holdings (“WALH”) changing thezoning where the Santolina development is proposedfrom Agricultural to Planned Communities; 2) the Level A Master Plan for the proposed Santolinadevelopment; and 3) the Santolina Level A DevelopmentAgreement between WALH and the Board.\n\nHonstein Oil Company\nAbuquerque/Bernalillo County Joint Air QualityControl Board’s (Control Board) permit allowing theHonstein Oil Company to operate a bulk fuelterminal in Albuquerque’s South Valley threatenscommunity health. Residents of the South Valleystruggle with chronic health conditions linked to airpollution which will be exacerbated by Honstein’sactivities.  \nThe Law Center's clients appealed the ControlBoard's decision, arguing thatAlbuquerque/Bernalillo County's air pollutionregulatory agency had a statutory obligation toconsider public health when issuing individualpollution permits.  Unfortunately, in October 2020,the state court of appeals sided with the ControlBoard and rejected our clients' appeal.  \nDespite the setback, the Law Center will continue towork with impacted communities to address thedisproportionate concentration of polluting facilitiesin their neighborhoods. A coalition of Southside residents has formed inresponse to concerns about public health. Manyresidents see the location of so many pollutingbusinesses near their homes and area schools, parksand athletic fields as environmental racism.\nIf the air pollution permit is issued, as anticipated,then the applicant will apply to Santa Fe County forpermission to consolidate its two existing asphaltplants into a single plant with the right to operate24/7, 365 days per year.\nSouthside residents and concerned residents of SantaFe are encouraged to voice their concerns at thepublic hearing for the Air Quality Permit on March 22.\n“THIS AREA HAS RAPIDLY TAKEN ONTHE CHARACTERISTICS OF ASACRIFICE ZONE.” — MIGUEL ACOSTA, EARTH CARE CO-DIRECTOR\nSanta Fe Asphalt\nBY ERIC JANTZ, STAFF ATTORNEY\nBY ERIC JANTZ, STAFF ATTORNEY;\nMASLYN LOCKE, STAFF ATTORNEY\n\n\nIn early 2019, then District Court Judge (now State Supreme Court Justice) Shannon Bacon entered adecision in our clients’ favor denying Aquifer Science’s appeal from a ruling by the State Engineer dismissingAquifer Science’s application to appropriate ground water from the Sandia Basin and a small part of the Rio  Grande Basin.  Later, in early 2020 District Court Judge Clay Campbell entered an order granting our clients their costs,including the fees paid by our clients to their experts.  The order that our clients’ costs be paid provided thatAquifer Science and the State Engineer are jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the costs,which means that each of them – Aquifer Science and the State Engineer – is liable to our clients for theentire amount of the costs, although our clients can only recover their costs once.  \nIn the summer of 2019, Seventh Judicial District CourtJudge Matthew Reynolds denied the appeal that theAugustin Plains Ranch filed from the State Engineer’s denialof the Ranch’s application to appropriate 54,000 acre feet ofground water per year from the San Agustin Basin.  TheRanch then filed an appeal to the State Court of Appeals,and the attorneys for the Ranch filed the Ranch’s Brief inChief in October of 2020.  \nFollowing the filing of the Ranch’s Brief in Chief, we werescheduled to file our Answer Brief on behalf of our clientsduring November of 2020.  Due to two requests forextensions of time that were granted by the Court ofAppeals, our Answer Brief is now due on March 12th.\nBY DOUGLAS MEIKLEJOHN, STAFF ATTORNEY\nAugustin Plains Ranch\nAquifer Science Effort to Appropriate Ground Water fromthe Sandia Basin and a Small Part of the Rio Grande Basin\nBY DOUGLAS MEIKLEJOHN, STAFF ATTORNEY; GAIL EVANS STAFF ATTORNEY;\nKENDRA PALMER, PARALEGAL\nIn 2019, the Trump administration issued final regulations defining the term “waters of the United States” under thefederal Clean Water Act. This definition is a crucial one; it establishes the scope of Clean Water Act jurisdiction,permitting, and water quality protection. The Trump administration rule, among other things, completely eliminatedClean Water Act jurisdiction and protection over all ephemeral streams.This rule leaves some 90% of New Mexicostreams unprotected.In June 2020, the Law Center filed a lawsuit on behalf of our clients against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the agencies that had issued the rule. The lawsuit challenges the rule as unlawfulon several substantive grounds. The federal agencies have sought a stay of the proceedings while officials in the Bidenadministration decide whether to repeal or replace the rule. In addition, in the Law Center filed an amicus brief in afederal appeals court supporting the State of Colorado in a similar challenge to the Trump rule.\nBY CHARLES DE SAILLAN, STAFF ATTORNEY\nWaters of the United States\n\nNew Mexico Terminal Services applied for a permitfrom Albuquerque Environmental HealthDepartment (EHD) to construct a hot mix batchasphalt plant at 9615 Broadway SE, just south of theValle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge in theMountain View neighborhood. \nThe proposed plant would be built next to the RioGrande river and the bosque, the beloved greencorridor that runs through the state’s largest city.Mountain View is a community of approximately4,000 residents, who are predominantly low-incomepeople of color.\nThe neighborhood has been saturated with dozens ofindustrial companies that have contaminated the air,water and land with toxins and hazardous wastes. Infact, Mountain View has been designated by the EPA(along with San Jose, its neighbor to the north) as anenvironmental justice community, meaning it hasalready been identified by the federal government asan impacted community facing the disparate impactsof environmental pollution.

The lawsuit – which was filed in the U.S.District Court for the District of New Mexico – soughtreversal of the agreement made by the U.S.Department of Energy and the New MexicoEnvironment Department (during the Martinezadministration) to replace the 2005 Consent Order forcleanup of pollution at Los Alamos National Laboratorywith a much weaker 2016 Consent Order. \nSpecifically, the lawsuit sought to:  1) require reinstatement of the 2005 Consent Order and 2) require the U.S.Department of Energy to pay the penalties that it owed for failure to meet deadlines set by the 2005 Consent Orderduring the time that the 2005 Consent Order was still in effect. \nSeveral years ago, the U.S. District Court Judge dismissed Nuclear Watch New Mexico’s claim that the 2005 ConsentOrder should be reinstated.  However, the Judge refused to dismiss Nuclear Watch’s claim that the U.S. Department ofEnergy should be required to pay the penalties owed for failure to meet deadlines under the 2005 Consent Orderbefore that Consent Order was superseded by the 2016 Consent Order.  \nNuclear Watch New Mexico, the Law Center and our co-counsel John Stroud (who is a private attorney in Santa Fe)have been engaged in discussions with the U.S. Department of Energy to determine whether we can settle NuclearWater New Mexico’s claim that the U.S. Department of Energy must pay the penalties that are at issue.  Thosesettlement negotiations have recently been joined by the New Mexico Environment Department – which intervened inthe litigation – and they are ongoing.  The negotiations are confidential.\nBY DOUGLAS MEIKLEJOHN, STAFF ATTORNEY\nNuclear Watch New Mexico v.

On April 26th, we filed a brief inresponse to their motion to dismiss. NMELC presented arguments in a July 21st hearing on the United States’ motion todismiss our lawsuit. The court has not yet ruled on the motion.\n\n\"PAWA UNDERSTANDS THAT WITHOUT WATER\nTHERE IS NO LIFE, JOBS, OR ECONOMY, THAT\nTHE MINE SUPPORTERS WHO LOOK TO JOB\nCREATION HAVE NOT YET UNDERSTOOD THEIR\nOWN NEED FOR WATER, AND THAT THE\nWATER NMCC (NEW MEXICO COPPER\nCORPORATION) FALSELY CLAIMS TO OWN\nWOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO SUPPLY THE\nNEEDS OF A CITY THE SIZE OF SILVER CITY\nSUPPORTING A LARGE ECONOMY WITH MANY,\nMANY TIMES THE JOB POTENTIAL OF COPPER\nFLAT MINE.\" \n- PERCHA-ANIMAS WATERSHED ASSOCIATION\n(PAWA)\nThe Tererro Mine, another proposed mining operation, would be located in the Upper Pecos River watershed, near thesite of the old Tererro Mine. The old mine, which operated in the 1930s, has left behind a legacy of tailings and minewastes that continue to threaten the Pecos River. The proposed new mining operation would extract copper, zinc, lead,gold, and silver. So far, the mining company has sought regulatory approval only for mineral exploration activities,which includes the drilling of up to 30 borings several thousand feet deep.\nThe Law Center and its client are part of a coalition of environmental, wildlife, community, and tribal organizationsopposing the mine. The coalition has advocated for strong conditions in the exploration permit under the New Mexico  Mining Act. A public hearing on the exploration permit will probably be held in the spring of 2021. In addition, thecoalition has requested that the U.S. Forest Service conduct an environmental assessment of the exploration proposalunder the National Environmental Policy Act. The Forest Service, in response, has reversed its earlier position andagreed to conduct the assessment.\nCopper Flat Mine\nThe Copper Flat Mine is a proposed open-pit copper mine near\nHillsboro in Sierra County. Mining operations, if they occur,\nwould have the potential to contaminate groundwater through\nnaturally-occurring fractures in bedrock, posing significant\nthreats to water quality and fragile ecosystems. The mine will\nalso leave behind a large pit lake that will exceed water quality\nstandards. The lake will draw in surrounding groundwater and\ncause it to evaporate.\nIn collaboration with clients and other grassroots partners, the\nLaw Center is working in several forums to oppose the mine and\nto mitigate its potential harmful effects. First, the Law Center has\nchallenged the groundwater discharge permit for the mine in\nagency regulatory proceedings. In 2018, we appealed the permit\nto the New Mexico Court of Appeals.\nThe case has been briefed, and we are awaiting a decision from\nthe court. Second, in a separate agency proceeding, we have\nchallenged the operating permit for the mine under the New\nMexico  Mining Act. In early 2020, responding to the Law\nCenter’s arguments, New Mexico state regulators determined\nthat the mine operator had not demonstrated it has sufficient\nwater rights to operate and reclaim the proposed mine. \nThe permit apparently will not be issued until the operator makes\nthis demonstration. Third, we are opposing the transfer of water\nrights to the mine in proceedings before the Office of the State\nEngineer and in the New Mexico Court of Appeals.\nBY CHARLES DE SAILLAN, STAFF ATTORNEY\nTererro Mine\nBY CHARLES DE SAILLAN, STAFF ATTORNEY\n\nNew MomentumIn September 2020, we held two online Meet & Greet events.

Antoinette Sedillo\nLopez and Sen. Liz Stefanics, sought to protect fresh water from being used in fracking and would have\nprohibited oil and gas waste water from being used off of oil fields. Although SB 86 passed its first committee,\nSenate Conservation, it was unfortunately tabled in Senate Judiciary, in a unanimous vote that included the\nSenate Democrats. The reality is that the oil and gas industry plays a huge role and has a major influence at the\nRoundhouse. Organizations and coalitions are strategizing on next steps to address the stronghold of oil and\ngas and to address what have been viewed as problematic processes at the legislative session. The bottom line\nis that frontline communities remain vulnerable to environmental contamination from \"produced\" water.\nThis bill creates private rights of action in the environmental statutes: the Air Quality Control Act, the Water\nQuality Act, the Hazardous Waste Act, the Solid Waste Act, and the Oil and Gas Act (a private right of action\nprovision already exists in the Mining Act). Rep. Georgene Louis is sponsoring this bill. HB-50 would be an\nimportant step towards environmental justice in New Mexico; it ensures that individuals can sue to protect the\nenvironment, rather than leaving enforcement solely to the state agencies.\nHB-50  Private Right of Action\nSB-8  Local Government Air Quality Regulations\nThis bill removes the clauses in the Air Quality Control Act and the Hazardous Waste Act that bar the\nEnvironmental Improvement Board, local governments and the NM Environment Department from adopting\nregulations that are “more stringent than\" federal regulations. This legislation would make it easier for the\nEnvironment Department to regulate ozone precursors (VOCs and NOx) from oil and gas production. Reducing\nVOC and NOx emissions effectively reduces methane emissions, and combats climate change. Sen. Peter Wirth\nand Sen. Linda Lopez are co-sponsoring this bill, and Rep. Andres Romero will carry it in the House.\nSB-296  Increasing Penalties for Environmental Violations\nSB-86  Protect Our Water Bill\nThis bill increases the Maximum Civil Penalties that can be collected under the environmental statutes by\nadjusting the penalty amounts for inflation that has occurred since the passing of each penalty provision. This\nbill covers the penalty provisions in the Air Quality Control Act, the Water Quality Act, the Hazardous Waste\nAct, the Solid Waste Act, and the Mining Act. The bill doubles the maximum penalties under these laws. It does\nnot cover the Oil and Gas Act because that Act’s penalty provision was amended in 2019. Right now, the same\nmonetary penalties have been on the books for 30–40 years. Monetary penalties are our best way to push\npolluters to change their practices and not violate New Mexico’s environmental protection laws. Sen. Brenda G.\nMcKenna and Sen. Jeff Steinborn are co-sponsoring this bill.\nThe Climate Solutions Act (HB 9) establishes nation-leading carbon pollution-reduction targets to benefit\ncurrent and future generations while ensuring that all New Mexicans will benefit from the increased jobs\nprovided in a green economy. The bill ensures that most impacted and historically disadvantaged communities\nhave a seat at the table to create a more diversified and resilient economy as we move to a net-zero-carbon\nfuture. The bill is sponsored by Reps. Melanie Stansbury and Angelica Rubio; HB 9 passed through House\nEnergy, Environment & Natural Resources Committee and, after being rolled over three times in a week, it has\nstalled on a vote in the House State Government, Elections & Indian Affairs Committee. There is a shift by\nproponents of the bill to support HB 297 and SB 112 which fund just transition and energy targets.\nHB-9  The Climate Solutions Act\nSave the Date: Our annual post legislative round-upevent will take place April 1st at 5:30 p.m. Registration for the link is on our webpage. \n\nNMELC Board of Directors Elects New Officers\nRamón is a high school social studies teacher at Alma d’arte Charter High School and\ncollege instructor in the College of Education at New Mexico State University.

City of\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico, challenging the validity of the Albuquerque City Council’s Resolution and Ordinance (calling for a\npurge of the Air Board and a moratorium on their ability to take action to improve residents’ quality of life) and the City’s\nillegal interference with the Rulemaking Proceeding; GCC Rio Grande, Inc., et al. v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air\nQuality Control Board, City of Albuquerque, challenging the validity of the adopted HEEI Rule and the Air Board’s authority\nand jurisdiction to adopt the HEEI Rule; and Mountain View Community Action et al. v. City of Albuquerque, also challenging\nthe validity and legality of the Council’s Resolution and Ordinance, as well as the City’s illegal interference with the\nRulemaking Proceeding and Complainants’ constitutional right to petition the government. \nIn addition to the lawsuits pending before the district court, National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia\n(NTESS), a subsidiary of Honeywell International and the contractor that operates Sandia National Lab, and a group of industry\npermittees have filed appeals of the rule adopted by the Air Board to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, asserting, among other\nthings, that the Air Board did not have the authority to adopt such a rule. The Mountain View Coalition has intervened in the\nappeals of the HEEI Rule to defend the Rule’s validity and will be submitting briefing to the Court in 2025.\nNMELC, on behalf of the Mountain View Coalition, also submitted two requests to the Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA), asking EPA to review the City of Albuquerque’s and the City of Albuquerque’s Environmental Health Department’s\n(EHD) compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the EPA’s implementing regulations (collectively, “Title\nVI”). Specifically, the Mountain View Coalition filed a Title VI Complaint with EPA’s External Office of Civil Rights\nCompliance, alleging that the City of Albuquerque violated Coalition members’ civil rights when the Albuquerque City Council\ninterfered with the December 2023 HEEI Rulemaking. The Coalition also submitted a Request for Compliance Review of\nEHD, asking EPA to thoroughly investigate and review EHD’s compliance with Title VI. EHD has an ongoing history of civil\nrights violations. In addition to EHD’s discriminatory conduct and interference with the HEEI rulemaking proceeding— \nSince the promulgation of the Health, Environment and Equity Impacts (HEEI) Rule in December 2023, members of the\nMountain View Coalition, made up of the Mountain View Neighborhood Association, Mountain View Community Action and\nFriends of Valle de Oro, along with NMELC, have been hard at work continuing to fight for environmental justice and clean air\nin Albuquerque and Bernalillo County. What started out as one rulemaking has resulted in three District Court lawsuits, two\ncases in the Court of Appeals, multiple civil rights complaints and continuous engagement with the Environmental Health\nDepartment’s implementation of the rule.\nMountain View Coalition/HEEI Ruling & Its Aftermath\nCASE UPDATES\nBY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY; KACEY\nHOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY & ANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY\n \n\n\nIn Southern New Mexico, Sunland Park and Santa Teresa residents continue to organize and hold the Camino Real Regional\nUtility Authority (CRRUA) accountable for CRRUA’s ongoing provision of unsafe drinking water; lack of transparency and\naccountability to community members; and continuous overcharging on resident’s utility bills. NMELC first began working\nalongside community members in February 2024 on this critically important environmental justice issue, after residents\nreached out to us following CRRUA’s failure to timely act, respond to, and notify residents of dangerous arsenic contamination\nlevels to the public water supply for over a week in 2023. The 2023 winter water crisis, however, is not the first time CRRUA\nhas failed to provide the public with safe drinking water and to notify residents of dangerous arsenic contamination levels, as\nCRRUA has repeatedly violated federal and state drinking water laws and regulations for more than a decade, since 2012. \nFollowing the 2023 winter water crisis, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) launched an investigation into\nCRRUA, finding CRRUA had injected an unknown amount of caustic soda into the public water supply and failed to properly\nmonitor and maintain its facilities, causing elevated pH and arsenic levels in the public water supply. NMED’s investigation\nalso revealed CRRUA had turned off and bypassed three of CRRUA’s four arsenic treatment facilities for the past year –\ndespite none of CRRUA’s operators and staff knowing how to properly and safely bypass these systems, as a third-party\nevaluation into CRRUA’s facilities and operations revealed in August 2024.  \nDespite CRRUA continuing to provide residents unsafe water, with arsenic contamination levels yet again above federal health\nstandards in June 2024, CRRUA raised residential water and wastewater rates on July 1, 2024, stating these rate increases were\nnecessary to ensure residents received water without significantly high arsenic levels. CRRUA ultimately shifted its\nresponsibility to provide safe and clean water to the public onto the residents of Sunland Park and Santa Teresa, a\npredominantly Hispanic community, with 91% of residents identifying as Hispanic, and with many residents who are elderly,\nworking class or low-income. In fact, 52% of residents in Sunland Park and Santa Teresa are low income and, in Sunland Park,\nspecifically, EHD’s inaction leading up to and during the hearing in order to allow EHD’s discriminatory air permitting\npractices to continue—EHD has been the subject of additional Title VI Complaints since 2014, when community groups filed a\ncivil rights complaint as a result of EHD and the Air Board’s failure to consider the cumulative impacts of health factors, social\nfactors, and additional air pollution burdens in already overburdened areas and EHD’s pattern and practice of discriminatory air\npollution permitting. NMELC and the Coalition are awaiting a decision from EPA on whether or not EPA will investigate\nEHD’s ongoing noncompliance with Title VI. \nFinally, NMELC and the Mountain View Coalition have been engaging with EHD’s development of an Overburdened Areas\n(OBA) Map. Under the HEEI Rule, EHD must develop a map of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County to be used in the air\npollution permitting process. The OBA Map, when completed, should show the most overburdened communities and, if a\npolluting facility wants to locate in that area, it will need to apply additional pollution mitigation measures in order to operate\nthere. EHD’s initial version of the OBA Map inexplicably failed to include Mountain View as an overburdened area. NMELC\ndrafted comments on EHD’s mapping process, urging EHD to utilize techniques used for overburdened area maps across the\nUnited States. On October 17, 2024, EHD released an updated version of the OBA Map, which now rightfully includes\nMountain View as an overburdened area. The final version of the OBA Map is expected to be released in January 2025. \nFighting for Clean & Safe Drinking Water in Sunland\nPark/Santa Teresa\n BY KACEY HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & ANN\nMCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY\n\nand the New Mexico Open Meetings Act, as well as for fraud, waste, and abuse of public funds. On August 19, OSA\nresponded, publicly announcing OSA’s investigation into CRRUA and committing to include the allegations and evidence\nprovided within NMELC’s request into OSA’s investigation, as well as offering to consider providing residents with\nopportunities to submit public comments on the investigation. \nHowever, OSA reneged on these statements, instead continuously failing to respond to community efforts to coordinate a\npublic listening session and public comment portal until, on September 24, OSA issued a letter stating it had concluded its\ninvestigation into CRRUA and found no evidence to support findings of CRRUA’s misuse of public funds. Notably, OSA’s\nclosure letter was the first time OSA had notified NMELC that OSA had limited the scope of its investigation to one public\nfund identified by NMED – in direct conflict with OSA’s previous statements to NMELC. Meanwhile, DOJ has yet to respond\nor provide NMELC with any information about DOJ’s investigation into CRRUA. \nWithin the same week as OSA’s abrupt closure of its investigation, on September 16, NMED and the New Mexico\nDepartment of Health (DOH) hosted a public town hall in Sunland Park to speak directly with residents about their ongoing\nissues with CRRUA. Both NMED Secretary James Kenney and NMDOH Secretary Patrick Allen attended. The public town\nhall lasted nearly three hours, as residents shared with the state agencies their frustrations, experiences, and ongoing concerns\nabout the safety of CRRUA’s water supply, as well as the ongoing lack of transparency from CRRUA, NMED, and other state\nofficials. \nIn response, NMED Secretary Kenney publicly committed to visiting residents’ homes the following day to collect water\nsamples to test and compare to CRRUA’s most recent test results. While NMED did visit residents’ homes on September 17,\nand appeared to collect water samples, an Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) request by NMELC revealed NMED never\nconducted any tests on residents’ water samples. \n \n Despite CRRUA continuing to provide residents unsafe water, with\narsenic contamination levels yet again above federal health standards\nin June 2024, CRRUA raised residential water and wastewater rates.\n  \nnearly one in three households are below the federal poverty line. CRRUA’s practice of shifting the financial burden of\nproviding residents the clean and safe drinking water they inherently have a right to thus further exacerbates the socioeconomic\nbarriers and disproportionate burdens Sunland Park and Santa Teresa residents already face and carry.\nIn response to CRRUA’s outrageous move to increase residential rates, community members posed several questions directly\nto Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham at her public town hall in Las Cruces on July 25, requesting the state’s assistance and\nleadership in protecting Sunland Park and Santa Teresa residents and holding CRRUA accountable. In response, the Governor\nmade several revealing statements and strong commitments, stating, “Money has gone to clean up the water, but that never\nhappened,” and promising to provide Southern New Mexico with clean water. \nOn August 2, NMELC, working alongside community members and Empowerment Congress of Dona Ana County, filed a\nrequest for the New Mexico Department of Justice (DOJ) and New Mexico Office of the State Auditor (OSA) to investigate\nCRRUA for any and all violations of environmental protection laws, financial and consumer protection laws,\n\nSouthside Santa Fe Civil Rights Complaint & LanguageAccess\nBY MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & KACEY HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY\nOn May 10, 2024, NMELC filed additional evidence of NMED’s intentional discrimination against New Mexicans with limited\nEnglish proficiency, showing that the hearing officer that denied a primarily-Spanish speaking resident the use of an interpreter\nand ultimately issued an air pollution permit to an asphalt plant located less than one mile from low-income community\nmembers and community members of color on Santa Fe’s Southside later denied a similar air pollution permit application for a\nfacility to be located more than one mile away from a primarily white, English-speaking affluent community in Alto, New\nMexico. \nUnfortunately, on July 30, 2024, ECRCO ultimately informed us that they would be closing the investigation into the\nComplaint, stating that NMED had solved its discrimination problem by creating a powerpoint slide that could be used to\neducate the public on how to use Zoom’s interpretation feature – completely ignoring NMED’s ongoing pattern of\ndiscrimination against residents of New Mexico with limited English proficiency. Despite requests for reconsideration, ECRCO\nhas maintained its position. The fight continues, however, and the community on Santa Fe’s Southside, as well as NMELC, will\nnot give up on achieving language access for all. Most recently, NMELC alongside WildEarth Guardians, submitted a letter to\nthe state’s Oil Conservation Commission (OCC) opposing the OCC’s baseless decision to deny Spanish interpretation services\nto members of the public during a rulemaking hearing which asked the OCC to better protect residents’ health from oil and gas\nextraction.\nTo date, CRRUA continues to distribute discolored water to residents. Empowerment Congress continues to conduct\ncommunity surveys about residents’ water quality, revealing hundreds of residents with non-consumable water have received\nutility bills costing thousands of dollars from CRRUA. Because CRRUA continues to fail to address residents’ concerns, and\nNew Mexico state agencies and officials continue to overlook these ongoing issues jeopardizing the health and wellbeing of\nSouthern New Mexico residents, NMELC and community members recently met, in October 2024, with EPA to request\nfederal oversight and involvement in the matter. As we move forward, NMELC is committed to working alongside our clients\nand community members to continue applying pressure on all fronts and in all forms in order to secure and protect Southern\nNew Mexicans’ fundamental right to clean and safe drinking water.\n NMELC alongside WildEarth Guardians, submitted a letter to the state’s\nOil Conservation Commission opposing the OCC’s baseless decision to\ndeny Spanish interpretation services to members of the public \nduring a rulemaking hearing.\n  \nOn September 15, 2021, NMELC clients, with the advice of NMELC, filed a civil rights complaint with the Environmental\nProtection Agency’s (EPA) External Civil Rights Compliance Office (ECRCO). Specifically, our client alleged that the New\nMexico Environment Department (NMED) discriminated against our client and their primarily Spanish-speaking community on\nthe Southside of Santa Fe by denying our client and others the use of a Spanish-language interpreter during an asphalt plant\nhearing, in violation of their civil rights. EPA accepted the complaint for investigation and promptly began conversations to\nresolve the issue with NMED.\n\nBY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY; & ANN\nMCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY\nWhen the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published its Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis that proposed\nremoving uranium mine waste from the Quivira mine and disposing it in a state of the art disposal facility at the Red Rock\nLandfill near Thoreau, the Red Water Pond Road community was cautiously optimistic. For the first time, a federal agency\nhad listened to their demands to remove mine waste from their community and off Navajo land rather than simply covering the\nwaste with dirt where it is. The community’s optimism quickly faded, however, when some Navajo Nation officials, people\nfrom outside the Navajo Nation, and New Mexico politicians began challenging the EPA’s proposed disposal plan based on \nerroneous and outright false information. Among the falsehoods opponents spread were that the Red Rock Landfill disposal\nfacility would be taking mill tailings and high-level radioactive waste. Additionally, some Navajo Nation officials asserted –\nwithout proof – that the Navajo Nation and Navajo allottees possess mineral rights underneath the proposed disposal facility. \nThe reality is that the proposed disposal facility presents the least risky alternative for Quivira mine waste disposal. Uranium\nmine waste is not highly radioactive and only presents a health hazard with chronic exposure, such as the exposure to the Red\nWater Pond Road community members. Short-term exposures, such as accidental spills during transportation that are cleaned\nup within hours or days, pose negligible risk. Further, disposing mine waste in a facility that is below surface grade, covered\nand has leak detection systems is significantly safer than covering waste in place. \nThe Red Water Pond Road community and the NMELC will continue to educate the public and decision makers about the\nrisks of disposing waste in a properly engineered facility instead of burying the waste in place. \nAdditionally, NMELC has filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in federal district court to compel the U.S. Bureau of\nIndian Affairs to release documents demonstrating whether the Navajo Nation (or anyone else) owns mineral rights beneath\nthe proposed disposal site. This will finally put to rest the specious claim that building a safe regional uranium mine waste\ndisposal facility would infringe on Navajo mineral rights. \nAugustin Plains Ranch Water Grab \nBY ANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY & MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY \nMore than 100 community members from Catron County crowded in the courtroom in Reserve, New Mexico on April 5,\n2024, to support the State Engineer’s denial of a permit requested by Augustin Plains Ranch to mine and hoard 54,000 acre\nfeet of water a year from the arid San Augustin Plains. The State Engineer denied the permit as speculative as Augustin Plains\nRanch had failed to show a genuine need to pump and hoard the groundwater. Agreeing APR’s request to transfer this water is\npure speculation, Judge Woods ruled from the bench denying the water transfer. \nOn August 23, 2024, after hearing further argument on the oral ruling he made back in April, Judge Woods entered his written\norder for summary judgment denying the water transfer. On September 24, 2024, APR appealed this court order to the NM\nCourt of Appeals, failing to take NO! For an answer and subjecting the citizens of Catron County to yet more costly litigation.\nAPR flagrantly continues to pursue its quest to pump precious groundwater from 30 proposed wells, which it hopes to pipe \nRed Water Pond Community Files FOIA Lawsuit vs.\nBureau of Indian Affairs\n\nCLIENT TESTIMONIALS\nHear what our brave and tireless clients are saying about how NMELC is helping them in their\nfight for clean and safe drinking water:\n“Partnering with the New Mexico Environmental Law Center amplifies work in the fight for clean\ndrinking water. Their legal expertise and dedication to environmental justice are invaluable in the\neffort to hold CRRUA accountable and secure safe, arsenic-free water for the residents of Sunland\nPark and Santa Teresa. Together, we are building a united front to protect community health and\npreservation of their rights.” \n—Daisy Maldonado, Director, Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County\n\"Without NMELC’s help, we would not have made any progress. It is taking time, but at the end of\nthis long journey, something good will come out of it for the community.\" \n—Jose Saldana, CRRUA customer/Sunland Park resident\n“Our organization is very grateful and thankful for the opportunity to have been in collaboration\nwith the NMELC team. With the support of NMELC, our organization has been able to move\nforward with environmental justice in our communities. NMELC understands the importance of\nscarce resources and what we need in our communities to make changes.” \n—VivianFuller,residentofSantaTeresa\nNMELC is supporting Tewa Women United’s work and advocacy to prevent Los Alamos National Labs (LANL)from venting radioactive water vapor, called tritium, into the air in Los Alamos, New Mexico, which will impact13,179 individuals and several neighboring communities, Pueblo Nations, and private landowners within a thirty-mile radius of the proposed venting site. \nThis summer, NMELC assisted Tewa Women United in drafting a letter to LANL urging them not to vent unlessand until their application demonstrated compliance with the ALARA principle – which requires radioactiveemissions to be “as low as reasonably achievable.” LANL has yet to do that, while also refusing to sample theheadspace of the flanged tritium waste containers. It is critical that LANL comprehensively evaluate and sample allaspects of its proposed venting because a very small dose produces a corresponding risk of cancer, posing asignificant threat to public health. In support of Tewa Women United’s ongoing advocacy efforts, NMELC has alsoassisted in the drafting, filing, and negotiations around several Freedom of Information Act Requests, which aredemanding information necessary to understand the severity of the public health and environmental threats posed byLANL’s project.\nWorking with Tewa Women United’s expert, Dr. Arjun Makhijani, we sent out a press release to help inform thepublic about two reports Tewa Women United commissioned, showing that a proposed tritium venting could havetriple the radiation exposure to infants and small children compared to adults. LANL submitted a ventingapplication to EPA Region 6, and that agency as well as the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) hasnot required LANL to consider impacts to infants or young children, in effect, not considering them to be “membersof the public.” Our combined efforts are an attempt to protect the most vulnerable from harmful health impacts inthe face of LANL’s impending tritium venting project, which could begin as early as Spring 2025. \nupstate to municipalities such as Belen and Rio Rancho. Through the entry of Judge Woods’ order in August 2024,NMELC fought alongside Catron County residents against APR’s water grab and to protect the water which residentsrely on for their homes, gardens and livestock. The long course of the APR litigation has included two speculative,nearly identical applications from APR to appropriate groundwater and multiple appeals to both the district court andthe NM Court of Appeals.  The ongoing litigation is a heartbreaking and significant drain on the lives and resourcesof the community members. APR has chosen to continue the drain by appealing Judge Woods’ well considereddecision to support the denial of its requested permit to mine the groundwater.\nTewa Women United & LANL Tritium Venting\nBY MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & KACEY HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY\nSunland Park/Santa Teresa\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR\nGENEROUS SUPPORT\nP.O.

The representatives from the Navajo Nation testified about how living beside\nuranium mine waste piles had turned their community from a thriving place where extended families lived together to a place\nthat is all but deserted because of disease and families making the difficult decision to move away to protect their health. The\nrepresentatives from Ute Mountain Ute Tribe described how living beside the only operational uranium mill in the U.S. has\nprevented them from expressing their cultural identity because contamination from the mill has befouled their medicinal plants,\nceremonial waters and the game they hunted. The representative from the Oglala Lakota Tribe testified how legacy mines and\nongoing in situ leach uranium mining has contaminated waters tribal members use for drinking and for ceremonies.  \nIn stark contrast, the delegation from the United States spent the bulk of its time congratulating themselves on how much\noutreach to tribes has improved and how much money they were planning to spend on tribal programs. Of the agencies\nrepresented—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Interior\n—only the EPA even hinted that the federal government held any responsibility for pollution from uranium exploitation.  \nAfter the hearing concluded, the Indigenous community representatives conducted follow-up visits with the EPA, elected\nofficials and the IACHR’s Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Issues. The thematic hearing has already increased public\nawareness and has helped open the door to further conversation with federal agencies about mine waste disposal. We anticipate\nthat further engagement with the Inter-American system will provide communities with greater leverage in holding the U.S.\ngovernment accountable for the longstanding impacts and harm stemming from the toxic legacy of uranium contamination.   \nAfter the historic promotional visit by Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) Commissioner Roberta\nClarke and Commissioner Esmeralda Arosamena de Troitiño to the Pueblo of Laguna and the Navajo Nation in 2023 to see\nfirsthand how uranium exploitation has affected Native communities, the IACHR held a thematic hearing on the human rights\nviolations resulting from the United States’ uranium exploitation policies. The hearing on February 28 during the\nCommission’s 189th Period of Sessions was the first time the IACHR devoted a thematic hearing exclusively to how the\nU.S.’s policies on uranium exploitation have affected Indigenous communities.  \nInter-American Commission on Human\nRights (IACHR) Hearing in DC\nCASE UPDATES\nBY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR \n\n\nThis option would remove the mine waste entirely from the Red Water Pond Road and Pipeline Road communities. It would\nrequire that the Quivira waste be disposed of in lined, subgradient trenches, equipped with leak detection systems. The\ndisposal facility would be located five miles from any population center. After the trenches are filled, they would be covered\nwith an evapotranspiration cover and monitored in perpetuity. In short, the Red Rock Landfill facility would be a state-of-the\nart disposal facility.  \nFor almost two decades, the residents of Red Water Pond Road have been demanding that the EPA remove mine waste from\ntheir community and they have finally been heard. Unfortunately, much misinformation has been circulating about the risks\nassociated with transporting the Quivira waste and the safety of the disposal facility. The frontline communities who have\nbeen most harmed are undaunted and will continue to advocate for offsite and off-Navajo Nation waste removal. \nQuivira Waste Removal Proposal/Red Water Pond\nRoad Community\nBY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR\nOn March 23, 2024, the U.S. EPA published its Engineering Evaluation/Cost Assessment (EE/CA) on the Quivira mine\nSuperfund cleanup and have, for the first time, responded to the Community’s demands. The Quivira mine complex has just\nover 1 million cubic yards of waste rock that is located within the Red Water Pond Road and Pipeline Road communities.\nThese two Navajo communities have lived immediately adjacent to the Quivira waste piles for decades. The EPA proposed\nfour different alternatives for remediating the waste, but its preferred alternative is to transport the Quivira mine waste out\nof the Red Water Pond Road and Pipeline Road communities and place it in a geotechnically safe facility off the Navajo\nNation on the Red Rock Landfill property. \n For almost two decades, the residents of Red Water Pond Road\nhave been demanding that the EPA remove mine waste from\ntheir community and they have finally been heard. \n\n\nOn December 4, 2023, the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board heard the Mountain View Coalition’s\n(MVC) petition on the proposed Health, Environment and Equity Impacts (HEEI) regulation that would have required the\nCity of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department (EHD) to address the air pollution burden impacting communities\nthat live with a disproportionate concentration of polluting industries and negative health impacts. The highly-contentious\nhearing lasted six days, ending on December 11, 2023 at 8pm, with the Board adopting a very limited version of the HEEI\nrule. \nMountain View Coalition/HEEI Hearing & Its Aftermath \nBY MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR \nDuring the hearing, the MVC and its allies presented substantial evidence indicating the need for the proposed HEEI rule\nand demonstrating how the HEEI rule would have addressed the cumulative impacts of air pollution disproportionately\nimpacting Albuquerque’s low-income communities of color and put an end to the EHD’s ongoing discriminatory air\npermitting practices. Specifically, the HEEI regulation would have prohibited polluting operations from locating within a\nmile of any overburdened community when that operation would substantially increase the risk of cancer or respiratory\ndiseases in the overburdened community. If the operation would not substantially increase the risk of cancer or respiratory\ndisease, the operation would still have to implement stringent pollution control technologies, pollution monitoring and\nreporting measures in order to obtain an air pollution permit. At the 11th hour, as a result of major stressors and political\npressure placed on the Air Board, the HEEI Rule was finally adopted; however, it merely requires the use of specific\npollution control technology by polluting sources located within one mile of an overburdened community. \nIndustry parties, alongside the EHD and the Albuquerque City Council, worked tirelessly to prevent the adoption of the\nHEEI rule, with the Albuquerque City Council going so far as to adopt legislation deeming the rulemaking illegal on the\nsecond day of the hearing. \nThe City Council’s actions have resulted in three lawsuits pending before three district court judges surrounding the\nvalidity and legality of the City Council legislation. On December 5, 2023, the Air Board filed the lawsuit, Albuquerque-\nBernalillo County Air Quality Control Board and the Board of County Commissioners of the County of Bernalillo v. City\nof Albuquerque, New Mexico, challenging the validity of the Council’s Resolution and Ordinance and the City’s illegal\ninterference with the Rulemaking Proceeding. On December 11, 2023, industrial permittees and commercial associations\nfiled the lawsuit, GCC Rio Grande, Inc., et al. v. Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board, City of\nAlbuquerque, \n Industry parties, alongside the EHD and Albuquerque City Council,\nworked tirelessly to prevent the adoption of the HEEI rule, with \nCity Council going so far as to adopt legislation deeming the \nrulemaking illegal\n  \n\nchallenging the validity of the adopted HEEI Rule and the Air Board’s authority and jurisdiction to adopt the HEEI Rule. On\nDecember 11, 2023, Complainants filed their lawsuit, Mountain View Community Action et al. v. City of Albuquerque, also\nchallenging the validity and legality of the Council’s Resolution and Ordinance, as well as the City’s illegal interference with\nthe Rulemaking Proceeding and Complainants’ constitutional right to petition the government. To date, all three lawsuits are\nongoing. Most recently, on January 25, 2024, the Air Board received a favorable ruling in their case, with the issuance of a\npreliminary injunction against the City of Albuquerque, enjoining the City from enforcing the Resolution and Ordinance until\nthe merits of the matter are resolved.\nIn addition to the lawsuits pending before the district court, three groups, including National Technology and Engineering\nSolutions of Sandia (NTESS), a subsidiary of Honeywell International and the contractor that operates Sandia National Lab,\nand the EHD, have filed appeals of the rule adopted by the Air Board to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, asserting, among\nother things, that the Air Board did not have the authority to adopt such a rule. The Mountain View Coalition has intervened\nin the Court of Appeals proceedings to defend the rule adopted by the Board and ensure their communities are protected. \n Santa Fe Civil Rights Complaint\nBY MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & KACEY HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY\nOn September 15, 2021, NMELC clients, with the advice of NMELC, filed a civil rights complaint with the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) External Civil Rights Compliance Office (ECRCO). Specifically, our client\nalleged that the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) discriminated against our client and their primarily\nSpanish-speaking community on the Southside of Santa Fe by denying our client and others the use of a Spanish-language\ninterpreter during an asphalt plant hearing, in violation of their civil rights. EPA accepted the complaint for investigation and\npromptly began conversations to resolve the issue with NMED. Since 2021, however, communications with ECRCO have\nbeen limited—but NMED’s discrimination against New Mexicans with limited English proficiency has not. \nOn May 10, 2024, NMELC filed additional evidence of NMED’s intentional discrimination against New Mexicans with\nlimited English proficiency, showing that the hearing officer that denied a primarily-Spanish speaking resident the use of an\ninterpreter and ultimately issued an air pollution permit to an asphalt plant located less than one mile from low-income\ncommunity members and community members of color on Santa Fe’s Southside later denied a similar air pollution permit\napplication for a facility to be located more than one mile away from a primarily white, English-speaking affluent\ncommunity in Alto, New Mexico. We are currently awaiting any additional response from ECRCO and NMED. \n Santolina Development \nBY MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & KACEY HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY\nSince 2015, NMELC has partnered with clients and communities in a battle to protect the limited water resources of the\nMiddle Rio Grande region. The proposed Santolina development on Albuquerque’s West Side would use more than 3.8\nbillion gallons of water per year, but the developers have never been able to obtain the required water availability agreement\nfrom the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority. The proposed development project has never broken\nground, in large part due to delays and opposition from our dedicated and tenacious clients, in partnership with NMELC\nattorneys and other community allies.\nDespite several rounds of decision-making and approval by the Bernalillo County Board of County Commissioners, the\nproposed Santolina Development still sits vacant, primarily due to the lack of a need for, and water supply to, the\nDevelopment. In October 2023, the University of New Mexico’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research (BBER)\npublished its report entitled the “Potential Impacts of Santolina Development,” confirming what clients and the Contra\nSantolina Working Group have said for over a decade: the Santolina Development will result in a net-cost to the residents of\nBernalillo County in violation of the Planned Communities Criteria and the data relied on by the Santolina developers\nresulted in growth and development targets that were overstated, unreasonable, and overly optimistic. In addition to these\nflawed and unlikely development goals, water scarcity and drought in New Mexico is only increasing, such that any\nadditional development in Bernalillo County would almost certainly harm and impact current water users in the area. \nNMELC is continuing to work alongside the Contra Santolina Working Group to urge the Bernalillo County Commission to\nreview its 2015 approval of the Santolina Development and reconsider whether the Santolina Master Plan is valid, or needed\nat all, in Bernalillo County. \n\nAugustin Plains Ranch Water Grab\nBY ANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY & MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY \nAt a momentous hearing on April 5, 2024, more than 100 community members from Catron County crowded the court room\nand hallways of the Seventh Judicial District court in Reserve, New Mexico to hear oral argument on the Augustin Plains\nRanch LLC’s (APR) continuing and relentless requests to mine and hoard 54,000 acre feet of water a year from the arid San\nAugustin Plains. District Court Judge Roscoe Woods heard arguments from APR and the many allied parties opposing the\nwater transfer including the State Engineer Water Rights Division, the Catron County Board of County Commissioners, the\nHelen Hand Ranch, and two groups of area residents protesting the transfer including one group represented by NMELC. \nAgreeing that APR’s request to transfer this groundwater is pure speculation, meaning that APR had failed to show a genuine\nneed to pump and hoard the groundwater, Judge Woods ruled from the bench and denied the water transfer because it is\ncontrary to New Mexico law. The Judge granted the State Engineer’s Motion for Summary Judgment, ultimately preventing\nAPR from pumping water from 30 proposed wells, which APR hoped to pipe upstate to municipalities north of Socorro such\nas Los Lunas and Belén. Since 2007, NMELC has fought alongside Catron County residents against APR’s water grab and to\nprotect the water which residents rely on for their homes, gardens and livestock. \nThis decision marks a major win for water, people and ecosystems. The long course of the APR litigation has included two\nspeculative, nearly identical applications from APR to appropriate groundwater and multiple appeals from the State\nEngineer’s decisions denying these applications to both the district court and the New Mexico Court of Appeals. This\ndecision, again denying APR’s application, will be precedential for the State Engineer moving forward in determining when\napplications to transfer water are speculative and the applicants do not show an imperative need for the water they seek. It is\nour hope that APR will finally take NO! for an answer.  \nNew Case: Sunland Park/Santa Teresa Water Crisis \nBY KACEY HOVDEN, STAFF ATTORNEY; MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY; & ANN\nMCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEY\nFor years, the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority (CRRUA) has provided Southern New Mexico residents in Sunland\nPark, Santa Teresa, and surrounding colonias (rural communities within the US-Mexico border region that lack adequate\nwater, sewer, or decent housing due to government neglect) with unsafe drinking water. On multiple occasions over the past\nseveral years, arsenic contaminant levels in CRRUA-provided consumer water have remained well above the federal health\nstandards and maximum contaminant levels established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in one instance,\ntesting 80 percent above the federal health standards. \nThis ongoing water quality crisis hit its peak in the late winter of 2023, when residents began reporting, via social media,\nslimy, discolored, odorous, and foul-tasting water. While CRRUA failed to respond or act for days, a later investigation by the\nNew Mexico Environment Department uncovered arsenic contamination in the CRRUA water supply, and the fact that three\nCRRUA arsenic treatment plants had been “offline and bypassed” for more than a year.\nAfter receiving a request for assistance from local community members in February 2024, NMELC is now working alongside\nthe community in their efforts to obtain safe and clean drinking water, as well as more transparency and accountability from\nCRRUA. NMELC continues to support community-led efforts as this ongoing water crisis develops and changes on a nearly\ndaily basis. \n\n\nGIFT ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nTransformative One-Time Gift\nHumbles & Inspires NMELC to\nContinue Our Work\nAs many of you know, we announced on March 21, 2024 that\nNMELC along with 9 other New Mexico organizations, was\nselected from over 6,600 applications from across the nation to\nreceive a generous $2 million dollar one-time gift from\nMacKenzie Scott’s Yield Giving Open Call.\nAll of us at NMELC are humbled and deeply grateful to receive this major gift!

The Air Board will hold a public hearing on the merits of the proposed\nregulation from December 4 to December 8 at the Albuquerque Convention Center. It is critical for community members\nwho care about environmental justice and healthy air quality to speak up during the public comment portions of the\nhearing.\nThe most recent iteration of the HEEI regulation prohibits polluting operations within a mile of any overburdened community\nwhen that operation would substantially increase the risk of cancer or respiratory diseases in the overburdened community. If\nthe operation would not substantially increase the risk of cancer or respiratory disease, the operation would still have to\nimplement stringent pollution control technologies, pollution monitoring and reporting measures in order to obtain an air\npollution permit.  \nIn addition to the HEEI rulemaking itself, MVC has been hard at work fighting a pair of bills that would delay the HEEI\nrulemaking, sponsored by City Councilor Dan Lewis. These bills would dissolve the current Air Board, replacing its members\nwith hand-picked Industry representatives. They also contain many other provisions that would limit the ability of\nAlbuquerque residents and community members to petition the Air Board for rule changes and would put the ultimate\ndecisions about air quality in the hands of the City Council rather than the highly qualified members of the Air Board. These\nbills are nothing more than an illegal power grab. On November 8th, City Council voted 5-4 to approve both bills—as this\ngoes to print we are hoping Mayor Tim Keller vetoes both bills. MVC and NMELC are urging Bernalillo County residents to\nask the Mayor to veto both bills and ask their City Councilors to sustain the veto if necessary. The HEEI regulation is a\nhistoric, precedent-setting regulation that addresses decades of environmental racism in a low-income community of color.\nThis is an important moment in the history of the struggle for environmental justice in New Mexico.\nThe Mountain View Coalition (MVC) continues to refine its proposed Health, Environment and Equity Impacts (HEEI)\nregulation that will require the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department to address the air pollution burden\nimpacting communities that live with a disproportionate concentration of polluting industries and negative health impacts. In\nAugust, the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Joint Air Quality Control Board (Air Board) mandated a series of pre-hearing\nmeetings between stakeholders, which have concluded and, while MVC worked in good faith to address Industry concerns\nwith the proposed regulation, the industrial stakeholders, including the University Of New Mexico Board Of Regents, the\nNational Nuclear Security Administration and Kirtland Air Force Base continue to oppose meaningful measures that would\nprotect overburdened communities. \n Mountain View Coalition/Cumulative Impacts\nCASE UPDATES\nBY MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR \n The HEEI regulation is a historic, precedent-setting regulation \nthat addresses decades of environmental racism in a \nlow-income community of color.\n\nNext, the Commissioners and their staff visited Churchrock and the Red Water Pond Road Community. Historic uranium\nmining has impacted both Churchrock and Red Water Pond Road. Churchrock is the site of the 1979 United Nuclear\nCorporation uranium mill tailings dam break that resulted in the largest release of radioactive material in U.S. history. The\nCommissioners visited old uranium mine sites near peoples’ homes and saw firsthand the Geiger counter readings that\npeople in Churchrock and Red Water Pond Road experience daily. The geiger counter readings were above background, in\nsome cases substantially above background, which raised commissioners’ concerns about their own personal safety. \nThe Commissioners visited Crownpoint next and saw the site of the proposed Laramide/NuFuels uranium processing plant\nthat would process uranium slurry from proposed mines in Churchrock and Crownpoint. ENDAUM member Christine\nSmith showed the Commissioners how close the proposed plant is to her home, her church and the local elementary\nschool, a quarter mile away. Christine shared an emotional account of how the processing plant would affect her and her\nfamily.  \nThe Commissioners wrapped up their visit with a dinner and a presentation to the community about how they could use\nthe regional human rights system to protect themselves. This was truly a historic visit—the first time any Commissioners\nfrom the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have visited Indigenous communities in North America. It is our\nhope that our clients will get a hearing in 2024.\nIACHR Makes Historic Visit to New Mexico\nBY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR\nOn July 26, two members of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and their staff came to New Mexico to\nconduct a promotional visit to uranium impacted communities. Commissioner Roberta Clarke and Commissioner\nEsmeralda Arosamena de Troitiño made this historic site visit to learn how uranium mining has affected Indigenous\ncommunities. The Commissioners first visited the Pueblo of Laguna and met with residents who have lived near the now-\nclosed Jackpile uranium mine. The Jackpile mine operated between 1952 and 1982 and was at one time the largest open-\npit uranium mine in the world. After the mine closed, the operator conducted reclamation activities under the supervision\nof the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of Land Management, but as is often the case, those reclamation efforts\nproved inadequate to protect human health and the environment. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated\nthe Jackpile mine a Superfund site in 2013, and restoration efforts continue today. The Commissioners heard stories of\nhow pollution from the mine has affected Laguna residents’ health and cultural practices. The Commissioners also\nattended the Pueblo’s traditional Feast Day. \n The geiger counter readings were above background, in some \ncases substantially above background, which raised \ncommissioners’ concerns about their own personal safety. \n\nSince Larry King, a longtime community leader and member of Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM)\ndiscovered that Laramide Resources, a Canadian uranium mining company, had set up drill rigs across the two-lane road from\nhis residence in January, the news about Laramide’s proposed uranium mine has grown more ominous. Laramide was\nconducting “confirmatory” drilling regarding the size and quality of uranium deposits that run under the land across from and\nunderneath Mr. King’s residence. Laramide, which purchased Hydro Resources, Inc., the company that has been threatening\nto mine uranium in Churchrock and Crownpoint for decades, failed to notify community members of its project. While the\ndrilling has concluded, ENDAUM is still gravely concerned that project development could begin this year. In a recent press\nrelease, Laramide announced that it had received a $1.7 million dollar grant to work with Los Alamos National Lab to\ndemonstrate that it will be able to restore groundwater it will contaminate if it is allowed to begin operations in Churchrock\nand Crownpoint. No ISL mine has ever restored an aquifer to a state where it can be used for domestic or agricultural\npurposes. Laramide indicated that it intends to begin mining operations within three years. ENDAUM and the Law Center are\ncommitted to pursuing every legal and legislative option to ensure that the community's water, land and air will be protected. \nENDAUM/Laramide Drilling \nBY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR\nRed Water Pond Road Community/Quivira Waste\nFor approximately fifteen years, the Red Water Pond Road Community Association has advocated that uranium mine waste\nfrom the nearby Northeast Churchrock Mine (NECRM) and Kerr-McGee/Quivira mines be moved away from their\ncommunity and off Navajo Nation land. Unfortunately, federal agencies ignored their request for waste from the NECRM,\nchoosing instead to consolidate that waste on top of the mill tailings piles at the nearby UNC uranium mill just about half a\nmile away.  \nThis summer, however, the U.S. EPA finally heard the Community’s concerns and proposed to move the Quivira mine\nwaste to a geotechnically appropriate site away from the community and the Navajo Nation. The EPA proposed moving the\nmine waste to the Red Rock Landfill near Thoreau. This landfill is a below grade facility that is not near populated areas\nand is far from groundwater. It has a liner and leak detection system. In short, it is a site suitable for mine waste disposal\nand is significantly safer than covering the waste in place. The Community will continue to work with the U.S. EPA, the\nNMED and communities along the proposed transportation route to ensure that communities are protected.  \nBY ERIC JANTZ, LEGAL DIRECTOR \n No ISL mine has ever restored an aquifer to a state where it \ncan be used for domestic or agricultural purposes. \n\nSince 2014, NMELC has partnered with community members in a battle to protect the limited water resources of the\nLower Rio Grande Basin. Like vultures circling a carcass, mining interests and water speculators have been drawn to the\nCopper Flat mine site for decades. Overlooking the mesquite landscape and several vital waterways in the northern\nreaches of the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion, the Copper Flat mine site is nestled among the hills just a stone’s throw\nfrom the town of Hillsboro and from rural residents who stand to be adversely impacted by water rights transfers and\nmining operations. The site is within the Hillsboro Mining District, which is already pockmarked by dozens of ill-fated\nmines.\nDespite repeated attempts by multiple mining interests, the Copper Flat mine only operated briefly—for about three\nmonths—in 1982, before shutting down and leaving behind a legacy of contaminated groundwater and a contaminated pit\nlake. The mine has not operated since then.\nThe latest attempt to re-open the mine would require the mining company, New Mexico Copper Corporation, to secure\nwater rights for both the proposed mining operations and reclamation, which will consume a large quantity of water New\nMexico does not have to spare. The mining company has applied to the New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division\n(MMD) of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department for an operating permit but, in order for the operating\npermit application to go forward, the mining company must demonstrate that it holds adequate water rights to operate the\nmine and—more importantly—to reclaim the mine site. \nBY MARA YARBROUGH & ANN MCCARTNEY, STAFF ATTORNEYS \nCopper Flat Mine Cases\nNMELC is currently representing community members in two ongoing water rights cases related to the proposed mining\nproject. One case is a water rights adjudication, involving a determination of water rights water speculators sold to New\nMexico Copper Corporation and the other is a water transfer case, where New Mexico Copper Corporation, seeks to\ntransfer existing water rights belonging to Santa Teresa Capital from Doña Ana County to Sierra County for use at Copper\nFlat mine.\nIn the water rights adjudication, the Third Judicial District court recently filed its findings of fact and legal conclusions,\nafter the Court of Appeals returned the case to the district court for a further look, confirming a limit on the water rights of\nNew Mexico Copper Corporation to 861 acre feet per year (AFY) from their requested declaration of water rights in an\namount of more than 6,000 AFY. Attorneys on the case are finalizing a form of order to submit to the court. NMELC\nattorneys will continue working with our clients to protect the water rights of the Hillsboro Mutual Domestic Water\nConsumers Association from this attempt to re-open the Copper Flat Mine.\nIn the ongoing water transfer case, the mining company is seeking to transfer 2400 acre feet per year of water rights\nbelonging to Santa Teresa Capital to the Copper Flat mine site for mining operations. NMELC represented individual and\norganizational clients opposing this water rights transfer in a two-week hearing in August before the Office of the State\nEngineer (OSE). NMELC attorneys are currently writing post-hearing briefs for submission to the Hearing Examiner for\ndecision, arguing that the OSE’s approval of the transfer would result in unlawful impairment of existing water rights, is\ncontrary to the conservation of water in New Mexico, and is detrimental to the public welfare. While we remain optimistic\nabout the outcome, a decision may not be rendered for several more months.\n\nIn the face of uranium mining’s toxic legacy, community members of Crownpoint and Churchrock united to\nhold government agencies accountable, forming Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM).\nSince 1994, they have been resisting an in situ leach (ISL) uranium mine that would permanently contaminate\ndrinking water.\nCh r i s t i n e  S mi t h  & J o n a t h a n  Pe r r y\nMembers of Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM) \nChristine Smith: “I have been a resident of Crownpoint, New Mexico, for the last 54 years. Presently I live\nless than a quarter mile from the Crownpoint Uranium Processing plant. I have been a teacher for over 27\nyears at Crownpoint Elementary School, which is less than a mile from the processing plant. My siblings,\nchildren, and grandchildren also live within the town of Crownpoint. It was important for me and my\ndaughter, Lynnea in 1996/1997 to begin our work with ENDAUM. NMELC has been instrumental in\nproviding legal services, information, and support to ENDAUM in our fight against uranium mining.\nNMELC continues today to support our efforts to keep Crownpoint residents free from uranium mining, by\nproviding legal services, information, and support to ENDAUM, as in the passing of the Diné Natural\nResources Protection Act of 2005. A coordinated effort between Crownpoint community members and\nNMELC, we began to provide education on uranium issues to Chapter members, Council delegates, and\neven the Navajo Nation President. \nToday, NMELC continues to journey with us on this never-ending\nissue of uranium mining as we bring it to a national level, presenting\nour case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. \n“Water is Life” has become our rallying cry, from the time of our\nancestors to the future generations of the Navajo people.” \nIn the arid San Augustín Plains of central New Mexico, the long battle continues over a private corporation’s push for water\nrights of 54,000 acre feet per year (over 17 billion gallons) of New Mexico’s precious groundwater. Augustin Plains Ranch\n(APR) has been trying to appropriate this groundwater since 2007, through the filing of multiple, nearly identical,\nspeculative applications to the Office of the State Engineer (OSE). Despite its many applications being denied over and over\ndue to the fact that APR cannot demonstrate that it will be able to put the water it seeks to a beneficial use, APR is not\nshowing any signs of accepting “No!” as an answer from the State Engineer, or the New Mexico courts. NMELC represents\nnearly 20 clients who oppose APR’s attempts to procure and hoard this water. This case is one of pure water speculation,\nand its outcome could profoundly impact water speculation law in New Mexico. Summary Judgment Motions asking the\nCourt to dismiss APR’s appeal of the State Engineer’s decision denying APR’s Application in the case will next be heard by\nthe 7th District Judicial Court in Reserve in January 2024, and NMELC attorneys are hard at work preparing briefs to help\ninform Judge Roscoe Woods of our clients’ position on the issues in the case. There are many parties allied in opposition to\nAPR, including the Catron County Board of County Commissioners, the San Augustín Water Coalition, and the Water\nRights Division of the OSE. We are hopeful that January’s hearing will result in a favorable outcome for our clients and the\nbroader state of New Mexico, and again result in the denial of APR’s water grab.\n Augustin Plains Ranch Water Grab \nBY MASLYN LOCKE, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & MARA YARBROUGH, STAFF ATTORNEY\nCLIENT TESTIMONIALS \n\nFor generations, the Mountain View area of Albuquerque was made up of small farms and orchards. But in the\n1970s, the City and developers began changing the zoning of the area from rural, agricultural, to industrial,\ndespite public opposition. Today, over 40% of the land is zoned to allow for manufacturing, leaving residential\nareas surrounded by junk yards, paint facilities, concrete suppliers, asphalt plants, and fertilizer producers. The\nMountain View community has been designated by the EPA as an Economic Justice community because\nresidents are exposed to a higher concentration of industrial pollution compared to more affluent neighborhoods\nacross Albuquerque.\nOffice Manager, Jene Montano, and Development Associate, Alex Rivas sat with community members\nMagdalena Avila and Lauro Silva for an eye and heart opening conversation on the Health, Environment and\nEquity Impacts (HEEI) regulation, environmental justice, and the future of our tierra for the next seven\ngenerations. \nLauro explained that the Mountain View community has been working on HEEI for 19 years; the proposed\nregulation aims to hold polluting industries accountable for the harm they cause and take necessary actions to\nprotect the Earth for seven generations to come. As Lauro stated, “Environmental justice is about liberation.”\nThe community invited NMELC to provide technical assistance, and we continue to be guided by those\nwho are most impacted by environmental degradation. \n. \nMa g d a l e n a  Av i l a  & La u r o  S i l v a\nMember s  of  Mount ai n Vi ew Coal i t i on \nMagdalena shared that during this time of constant roadblocks and\nlack of respect for our Mother Earth, she is motivated and\nreinvigorated by people’s love and fight for the land in New Mexico.\nMagdalena described her connection to our tierra as intrinsically part\nof her being rather than viewing the environment as a separate entity.\nJonathan Perry: \"While working to protect my community and\nhomelands, NMELC has been a crucial partner in our legal arena.

NMELCproudly represents  over a hundred clients—both individuals and groups—fightingon issues that span across the protection of clean air, land, and water. Our cases rangefrom groundwater contamination, air pollution, long term uranium contamination,extractive mining, the protection of limited water resources, among others.\nIn this issue we provide timely updates on two of our most active cases—EasternNavajo Diné Against Uranium Mining's (ENDAUM) commitment to securing athematic hearing in front of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rightsfocused on the long-standing toxic legacy of uranium mining and its impacts toIndigenous and surrounding communities; and our historic and precedent-settingHealth, Environment, and Equity Impacts (HEEI) Regulation that is making its wayin front of the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board despitefierce opposition from industries.\nThese two cases alone—ENDAUM’s Human Rights Case and the HEEI Regulation—are groundbreaking in the precedent they each will set in the environmental justicesector. As we’ve mentioned before, ENDAUM’s petition to the IACHR is only thesecond environmental justice case against the United States deemed admissible bythis international body that will hold the US government to account for violating thehuman rights of our clients. The HEEI Regulation is part of a growing, nationalmovement that protects the health of frontline communities who continue to bear thebrunt of environmental pollution and harm by demanding agencies take into accountthe cumulative impacts borne from toxic industries. New Jersey and other states havealready set the stage for cumulative impacts regulations considered the “holy grail”of environmental justice. \nIn this issue, our dedicated staff attorneys provide updates on other key casework —from our continued work with the Red Water Pond Road Community Associationfighting for their community’s health and wellbeing against uranium contaminationto providing an important update on our clients’ battle to protect precious and limitedwater resources from the looming sprawl development known as the SantolinaMaster Plan. \nAs always, it is my honor to lead this powerful organization that is deeply committedto working alongside our clients in demanding environmental justice across variousareas—from fighting toxic air pollution, holding governmental agencies accountablefor environmental degradation, protecting sacred water, and to ensuring clean upfrom mine waste. \nWe hope you enjoy reading our updates! We are grateful for your continued support!\nIn solidarity,\nA LOOK AT THIS ISSUE:\n>>> FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n>>> CASE UPDATES \n>>> IMPACT REPORT/FINANCIALS\nA MESSAGE FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\nGREEN FIRE REPORT\nSpring 2023 Newsletter\nNEW MEXI CO ENVI RONMENTAL LAW CENTER \nBY: VIRGINIA NECOCHEA, PHD\n\nMeanwhile industry has come out in full force against the HEEI regulation, filing numerous last minute frivolous motions\nattempting to disqualify members of the Air Board and more than a dozen businesses, trade associations, and other entities\nhave joined as parties in opposition to the regulation, citing a false narrative that the regulation is set in stone and not subject\nto negotiation, and that it would shut down all economic activity in the county. These are misleading myths that distract\nfrom the fact that frontline communities have faced devastating health impacts from polluting industry being\ndisproportionately sited in their community. It’s long past time for conscientious businesses to get on board the growing\nnation-wide movement calling for cumulative impacts regulations as a way to advance environmental justice.\nWe know that the impacts of air pollution on low-income communities and communities of color in Bernalillo County are\nsignificant. The American Lung Association (ALA) recently gave Bernalillo County an “F” for air quality related to ozone\nand a “D” for fine particulate matter. As demonstrated in this recent ALA State of the Air report, air pollution does not affect\neveryone in Albuquerque equally; the effects of air polluting industrial permits overwhelmingly impact low-income\ncommunities, and communities of color experience the adverse health impacts of air pollution disproportionately. Air\npollution is associated with a range of health problems, including cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses, and low\nincome communities and communities of color are particularly vulnerable to adverse health impacts of air pollution because\npolluting industries are disproportionately located in their communities. In addition to being overburdened by polluting\nindustries, low-income communities and communities of color have less access to health care and nutritious food than more\nadvantaged communities, which amplify the health impacts of concentrated air emissions on overburdened communities. The\nproposed regulation allows EHD and the Air Board to make decisions that better protect residents’ health, which is especially\nimportant because low-income communities and communities of color in Bernalillo County have a greater risk of health\nimpacts including lowered life expectancy from pollution than more affluent, non-minority communities. The Health,\nEnvironment & Equity Impacts regulation is a historic, precedent-setting rulemaking effort by the community\nworking in partnership with NMELC and is the result of decades of grassroots organizing by residents who have lived\nnext to polluting industry and whose concerns have been ignored by regulators for years. Cumulative Impacts\nregulations are considered the “holy grail” of environmental justice organizing and we are seeing states across the country\nadopt EJ into their local decision making. Given the City of Albuquerque’s recent award recognizing its equity work, it would\nmake most sense for Bernalillo County to support this important regulation that centers equity.\nOn November 21, 2022, the Mountain View Coalition, consisting of the Mountain View Neighborhood Association,\nMountain View Community Action, and Friends of Valle de Oro, filed a Petition before the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County\nAir Quality Control Board asking the Air Board to hold a hearing on the Coalition’s Health, Environment and Equity\nImpacts (HEEI) Regulation. The regulation would allow the City of Albuquerque’s Environmental Health Department\n(EHD) and the Air Board to address the disparate impacts of air pollution negatively impacting the health and quality of life\nof Bernalillo County residents by denying air pollution permits to applicants seeking to locate facilities in communities that\nalready bear the disproportionate burden of air pollution, like Mountain View. The Board has agreed to hold a hearing on the\nregulation and has appointed a hearing officer, but a hearing date has not yet been set. \n Mountain View Coalition/Cumulative Impacts\nCASE UPDATES\nBY MASLYN LOCKE, STAFF ATTORNEY & ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY\n\nEastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining\nThe New Year started on a sour note for Larry King, a longtime community leader and member of Eastern Navajo Diné\nAgainst Uranium Mining (ENDAUM). Mr. King discovered that Laramide Resources, a Canadian uranium mining\ncompany, had set up drill rigs across the two-lane road from his residence. Laramide was conducting “confirmatory”\ndrilling to confirm the size and quality of uranium deposits that run under the land across from and under Mr. King’s\nresidence itself. Laramide, which purchased Hydro Resources, Inc. (HRI), the company that has been threatening to mine\nuranium in Churchrock and Crownpoint for decades, failed to notify community members of its project. While the\n“confirmatory” drilling has concluded, ENDAUM is still gravely concerned that project development could begin this\nyear. During the last several years, the United States has created numerous financial incentives for the nuclear industry,\nwhich will stimulate the uranium market directly and indirectly. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in particular\nincentivizes the uranium industry with tax credits to help preserve the existing fleet of nuclear power plants at $15 per\nmega-watt hour, new tax credits for nuclear reactors that generate hydrogen, plus $700 million to support development of\na domestic supply of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) to reduce the U.S.’s current dependence for 20 percent\nof this type of uranium from Russia. We expect these government subsidies to continue, increasing the risk of active\nuranium mining in Crownpoint and Churchrock, which would destroy valuable drinking water sources in their\ncommunities. NMELC will continue to work with our clients to protect precious drinking water as well as cultural and\nhuman rights by asserting these rights at the state, tribal, national and international levels.\nBY ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY\nInter-American Commission on Human Rights\nBY ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY \nEarlier this year, ENDAUM, Red Water Pond Road Community Association (RWPRCA), Buffalo Magpie Organizing\nand the White Mesa Concerned Community, with assistance from NMELC and the Multicultural Alliance for a Safe\nEnvironment, asked the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to hold a “thematic hearing” on the impacts of the\nUnited States’ uranium development policies on Native communities. Unfortunately, the IACHR did not hold a hearing\non this important issue, but ENDAUM director Jonathan Perry and RWPRCA member Teracita Keyanna traveled with\nSenior Staff Attorney Eric Jantz to Los Angeles for the IACHR’s 186th Period of Sessions to personally urge\nCommissioners to hold a thematic hearing on this important issue in future meetings. During our trip to L.A., we met one\non one with Commissioner Roberta Clarke, who committed to a visit to impacted uranium communities in New Mexico\nthis year. The coalition of groups also held a Side Event at the UCLA Law School where Jonathan, Teracita and Tonia\nStands (Oglala Lakota) gave presentations about the impact of uranium development in their communities. The Side\nEvent was well attended and feedback was positive. Finally, Jonathan was able to present testimony about uranium\nimpacts in his community to the entire IACHR during its meeting with civil society, and Eric read a statement from White\nMesa Concerned Community about the impacts of the White Mesa Uranium mill on their Indigenous lands, air and water.\nWe are hopeful a thematic hearing may take place in the Fall of 2023.\n\nWhile we were hopeful that the visit by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to the Red Water Pond Road\ncommunity in April 2022 would have inspired the Commission to listen to community voices about the NRC staff’s and\nU.S. EPA’s plan to consolidate waste from the Northeast Churchrock Mine (NECRM) at the United Nuclear Corporation\n(UNC) uranium mill rather than move that radioactive waste to a safe repository, in January 2023, the Commission decided\nto go forward with waste consolidation. This plan will move mine waste from the NECRM, which is mere yards away from\nRed Water Pond Road residences, to the UNC mill, located a half mile from the community. While we are disappointed\n(although not surprised) by the NRC’s decision, we continue to explore options with the RWPRCA for ways to hold the\nU.S. government accountable and to address community needs. Emerging research over the last 15 years has demonstrated\nthat living within a mile of uranium mine and mill waste greatly increases the risk of diseases such as hypertension, heart\ndisease, autoimmune dysfunction, cancer and premature death. Additionally, the damage caused to land, air and water from\nuranium development waste is a cultural insult to the Diné that is connected to cultural destruction and loss of identity.  \nRed Water Pond Road Community Association\nBY ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY \nSantolina\n \nSince 2015, NMELC has partnered with clients and community members in a battle to protect the limited water resources\nof the Middle Rio Grande region. The proposed Santolina development would use more than 3.8 billion gallons of water\nper year, but the developers have never been able to obtain the required water availability agreement from the\nAlbuquerque-Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority. The proposed development project has never broken ground, in\nlarge part due to delays and opposition from our dedicated and tenacious clients who are part of the Contra Santolina\nWorking Group, in partnership with NMELC attorneys.\n \nOn August 16, 2022, the Bernalillo County Board of County Commissioners (BCC) made its most recent decision\nregarding the proposed Santolina development, despite the developers’ continued failure to demonstrate water availability\nfor the development. Prior to the August 16 decision, the County Planning Commission recommended denial of the\nDevelopers’ proposed amendments to the Santolina Level A Master Plan and the Developers’ proposed Level B.II Master\nPlan due to the fact that the Developers could not explain where the water for the proposed plans would come from.\nUnfortunately and disappointingly, the BCC held a hearing in violation of their own procedural rules and voted to approve\nboth plans. \n \nOn behalf of our clients, NMELC filed an appeal in the second judicial district court, alleging that Bernalillo County\nviolated our clients’ right to due process. Specifically, we’ve argued that members of the public have a right to rely on the\nBCC’s articulated procedures when the BCC holds a hearing, and the BCC failed to follow its own rules, both in deciding\nto have a hearing on the plans and throughout the hearing on the plans. The case is pending before Judge Joshua Allison.     \n \nBY MASLYN LOCKE & MARA YARBROUGH, STAFF ATTORNEYS  \n\n \nThe Homestake uranium milling operation might be long-defunct, but the radioactive waste it left behind still\ncontaminates groundwater in multiple aquifers and poses a massive threat to nearby communities. Even as community\nmembers and organizers work to hold Homestake, the EPA, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) accountable\nfor the ongoing cleanup, Homestake has pursued an obstructive strategy. The company requested that the NRC review a\nrequest to allow Homestake to meet alternative cleanup standards that differ from federal clean groundwater standards.\nSimultaneously, the company would like agencies to agree that full remediation of the site is “technically infeasible.”\nFinally, the company is attempting to buy up nearby property owners’ land in exchange for silence, a move that, if\nsuccessful, would expand the site’s boundaries and relieve the company of pressure to clean up the site to current required\nstandards. Our clients have asked agencies to consider that contamination may prove to be more widespread than\ncurrently believed, with the potential to pollute even more underground water, surface water, and communities. NMELC\ncontinues to support our clients in engaging with agencies and keeping an eye on Homestake’s actions—and inaction—on\nthe ground. We are pleased to share that on May 17, 2023 the NRC announced it has declined to accept Homestake’s\napplication for Alternate Concentration Levels (ACLs), which is highly unusual but great news for our clients and the\nimpacted community. We will continue to monitor developments and to keep our supporters informed.\n \n \n  On May 17, 2023 the NRC announced it has declined to accept Homestake’s\napplication for Alternate Concentration Levels (ACLs), which is highly unusual but great\nnews for our clients and the impacted community.\nBY MARA YARBROUGH, STAFF ATTORNEY \nHomestake Barrick Gold Superfund Site\nAugustin Plains Ranch Groundwater Transfer\nBY MASLYN LOCKE & MARA YARBROUGH, STAFF ATTORNEYS\nNMELC represents community members and groups living near Datil, New Mexico, in their protest against Augustin\nPlain Ranch’s application for the transfer of 54,000 acre feet/year of groundwater to be used by unidentified\nmunicipalities in counties across the state via a yet-to-be-built 40-mile pipeline. The proposed water transfer, if\napproved, would negatively impact rural water users and alter the course of water management in New Mexico. The case\nhas been ongoing since 2007 and, most recently, on August 11, 2022, the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed a\nDistrict Court decision that had been favorable to our clients and impacted water users which denied the Ranch’s\napplication to appropriate groundwater. Now with the reversal, the District Court will again decide whether the Ranch’s\napplication to appropriate groundwater is speculative and contrary to the requirement that all water transfers in New\nMexico demonstrate that the use of the water is beneficial. While we do not yet have a new hearing date at the District\nCourt, all dispositive motions, meaning motions that could result in a decision, will be due in June, 2023, with a possible\nfinal decision slated for August. Preserving precious and scarce water resources is a critical environmental justice issue,\nespecially in New Mexico which has been experiencing decades of prolonged drought conditions.\n \n \n\nTulla Resources /Copper Flat Mine \nBY MARA YARBROUGH, STAFF ATTORNEY \nMining interests are asking the State Engineer to approve the transfer of water rights for the purpose of supplying water for\nmining and milling operations at the proposed Copper Flat Mine in southwestern New Mexico. The New Mexico Copper\nCorporation wants to develop the open-pit Copper Flat copper mine on an existing open-pit mine site near the town of\nHillsboro—and it needs water in order to operate. Tulla Resources applied to transfer several hundred acre feet per year of\ngroundwater rights, a transfer that would negatively impact water resources and others’ water rights throughout this arid\nregion and would enable the development of a polluting mine that would likely contaminate groundwater. Many people,\nincluding NMELC’s clients, protested the water rights transfer application, and our clients survived Tulla Resources’\nattempt to question their right to fight the application and to disqualify them from participating in the proceedings. A\nhearing before the Office of the State Engineer is scheduled for August, and NMELC continues to work closely with our\nclients as we prepare for the hearing.\n \nCunningham Hill Gold Mine\nBY MARA YARBROUGH, STAFF ATTORNEY & ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY \nIn the Ortiz Mountains near Santa Fe sits a large open pit, the remnants of the Cunningham Hill Gold Mine. The pit\ncontains a large pool of water that has been rendered acidic from seepage and runoff off the mine’s exposed pit walls; the\nsulfuric acid poses a potential threat not only to wildlife attracted to the surface water, but also to groundwater and\nsurrounding communities. LAC Minerals Barrick Gold Corporation is responsible for cleaning up and reclaiming the\nproperty, and although cleanup efforts to date have fallen short of hopes and expectations, LAC Minerals has asked the\nNew Mexico Mining and Minerals Division (MMD) to excuse it from certain cleanup requirements and to, in effect, allow\nit to walk away from long-term maintenance and monitoring of the site. The company submitted amendments to its mine\ncloseout plan through MMD; NMELC clients and State agencies have responded to the company’s requested\namendments; and our clients continue to press for complete cleanup and reclamation, as well as for long-term maintenance\nand monitoring of the site.\n \nAquifer Science \nBY MASLYN LOCKE, STAFF ATTORNEY  \nNMELC has worked alongside the Deep Well Protest Group and homeowners in the East Mountains to challenge the\nAquifer Science application to drill wells and draw large amounts of water for a “resort lifestyle community” larger than\nthe cities of Socorro or Raton between Santa Fe and Albuquerque. Vidler Water Company, a Nevada based company,\nsought to appropriate roughly 114 million gallons of water, for use by the proposed Campbell Ranch development, which\nwould negatively impact existing water users in the area. On December 15, 2022, the New Mexico Court of Appeals issued\na decision affirming the district court’s denial of the application based on the fact that drilling would impair existing water\nusers and would be inconsistent with the need to conserve water in the state. The New Mexico Supreme Court declined\nto consider the case, and, with that, the case is officially over. This decision is especially exciting because, as of 2021,\nany additional applications for new groundwater appropriation by the developer would be rejected based on the Office of\nthe State Engineer issuance of an order closing the Sandia Groundwater Basin to new appropriation applications, meaning\nthe communities’ 14-year long fight has finally come to an end! \nBY ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & MASLYN LOCKE, STAFF ATTORNEY \n Mountain View Coalition/NMTS Asphalt \nAfter five years of struggle in this environmental justice battle, the New Mexico Terminal Services (NMTS) case is finally\ncoming to a close. In 2018, the Mountain View Coalition, represented by NMELC, appealed a decision by the Albuquerque\nEnvironmental Health Department (EHD) to issue a pollution permit for an asphalt batch plant in the Mountain View\nneighborhood, even though the land on which the plant would be located was not zoned for heavy industrial use and\nMountain View already bears a disproportionate number of polluting industries. Because of the pressure from the\nMountain View Coalition, EHD terminated NMTS’s pollution permit earlier this year. While we celebrate this\namazing victory, we remain vigilant for other polluting projects that may target the Mountain View community. \n \n \n\nFoundations 60%\nDonations16.1%\nDAF13.1%Fees & Cost Reimbursement10.7% Other0.1%\nProgram 74.5%\nAdministration16.6%\nDevelopment & Fundraising8.9%\nINCOME:\n• Foundations ................................$512,180.94       60.0%\n• Donations.....................................$137,109.64      16.1%\n• DAF..............................................$111,720.89       13.1%\n• Fees & Cost Reimbursement.........$91,250.00       10.7%\n• Other................................................$1,010.66         0.1%\nTOTAL INCOME.............................$853,272.13\nEXPENSES:\n• Program.......................................$771,890.96       74.5%\n• Development & Fundraising.........$92,232.38         8.9%\n• Administration.............................$172,455.92       16.6%\nTOTAL EXPENSES......................$1,036,579.26\nNET INCOME...............................($183,307.13)\nOPEN cases\ncurrent clients\nyears of casework\naround the state\nIMPACT REPORT/FINANCIALS\n2022 Income\n2022 Expenses\nThanks to \nLa Montañita\nFood Co-op!\nMany thanks to La Montañita Food Co-op for\ntheir generous donation of $7,579.55 from their\nRound Up For Change program in April in honor\nof Earth Day!

Since NMELC first opened its doors in 1987, thanks to your ongoing support, we have continued to work in partnership with clients and communities on some of the most significant environmental cases protecting air, water and land across New Mexico, including state-level greenhouse gas emission limits, radioactive air and water pollution from uranium mines/mills, sprawl development, asphalt plant emissions, and advocacy for air quality rules at the state and local levels that protect all New Mexican communities. As we continue our journey, NMELC reaffirms its deep commitment to authentically integrating equity across our entire organization, from our board governance to our programs and legal services. During our strategic planning session held this past summer, NMELC formalized the integration of movement lawyering as a guiding framework for our organization. \n“Movement lawyering means taking direction from directly impacted communities and from organizers, as opposed to imposing our leadership or expertise as legal advocates. It means building the power of the people, not the power of the law” (American Bar Association, 2021). We are proud to share that NMELC will be the o n l y  environmental justice focused nonprofit law center in the state to integrate movement lawyering across its entire organization.  With our 35 years of service in mind, it is with much pride we present our latest Green Fire Report that includes updates on some of our most active cases: the continued battle against the Santolina Master Plan; the unprecedented decision of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights declaring ENDAUM’s petition admissible; highlighting the vital work of one of our newest clients— Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium; among other updates provided by our dedicated legal team.\nWe take a moment to recognize that our work would not be possible without the support of long-term and new donors whose financial contributions help our organization take on these challenging and precedent-setting environmental justice cases that often take several years if not decades to complete. \nAll of us at NMELC thank you for believing in the importance of our work and for helping to uphold environmental justice across our state! I hope you enjoy reading our Green Fire Report and here’s to the next 35 years of history making at NMELC!\nIn solidarity,\nGREEN FIRE REPORT\nA LOOK AT THIS ISSUE:\n>>> FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n>>> CASE UPDATES \n>>> CLIENT & COMMUNITY HIGHLIGHT\nA MESSAGE FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\nQ3 2022 Newsletter\nNEW MEXICO ENVIRONMENTAL LAW CENTER \nBY: VIRGINIA NECOCHEA, PHD\n\n\nIn addition, the BCC recently considered the Bernalillo County Planning Commission’s (CPC) recommendation to deny \nthe Amended Level A and Level B.II Master Plans on August 16, 2022. This hearing presented many procedural issues \nfor the community, including dysfunctional sign-up procedures and hybrid meeting format plus uncertainty around the \nrules the BCC was following throughout the hearing. Most importantly, the hearing should never have taken place \nbecause no party officially appealed the CPC recommendation. Despite these issues and the fact that the plans enable the \ndeveloper to move forward with the project without securing a water service provider in a time of increasing water \nscarcity, the BCC voted to approve both plans. \nOn behalf of our clients, NMELC has filed suit to challenge the BCC’s decision in order to safeguard the due process \nrights of the community and ensure that the County provides the public with a just and equitable process. Working \ntogether with community members, we have successfully delayed this unneeded and unwanted development project for \nmore than 9 years. We will continue to protect the precious water resources of the Middle Rio Grande and the South \nValley’s agricultural traditions from being exploited by developers’ greed.\nSince 2015, NMELC has partnered with clients and communities in a battle to protect the limited water resources of the \nMiddle Rio Grande region. The original Santolina development plan called for 37,000 homes for approximately 95,000 \npeople that would use more than 3.8 billion gallons of water per year. However, the developers have never been able to \nobtain the required water availability agreement from the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority. On \nAugust 25, 2021, the Bernalillo County Board of County Commissioners (BCC or Board) voted to approve the Santolina \ndeveloper’s requested Zone Map Amendment, which the developers (Western Albuquerque Land Holdings, LLC and \nConsensus Planning, Inc.) must have in place in order to build anything on the Santolina property, a massive housing \ndevelopment proposed on Albuquerque’s West Mesa.\n \nThis was the Board’s second time hearing arguments related to the Zone Map Amendment – the BCC first approved the \nAmendment in 2015, but that decision was reversed by the Court because it violated the due process rights of the \ncommunity. NMELC, on behalf of the SouthWest Organizing Project, the Pajarito Village Association, and a few \nindividuals, appealed the BCC’s 2021 decision to the Second Judicial District Court on September 24, 2021, again \nasking the Court to review whether, in voting to approve the Zone Map Amendment, the BCC once again violated the \ndue process rights of the community. The District Court ultimately upheld the BCC’s approval of the Zone Map \nAmendment on July 29, 2022. Unfortunately, with the Zone Map Amendment in place, the developers are one step \ncloser to building a sprawl development at the expense of Bernalillo County residents’ quality of life.   \n Santolina\nBY MASLYN LOCKE & MIA MONTOYA HAMMERSLEY, STAFF ATTORNEYS\nCASE UPDATES\nNMELC has filed suit to challenge the BCC’s decision in order to \nsafeguard the due process rights of the community \n\nBY ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY\nEastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining\nSince 1994, members of the Diné communities of Crownpoint and Churchrock have been resisting planned uranium \nmining that would destroy valuable drinking water sources where they live. The mining company, Laramide Resources, \nhas secured all its necessary federal permits, and appeals filed by Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining \n(ENDAUM) in federal courts have been fruitless. In 2011, ENDAUM filed the first ever petition alleging human rights \nviolations against the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for its uranium development policies and practices, which\ncontinue to disproportionately impact communities of color, especially Indigenous communities. The petition was \naccepted in 2021, and since then ENDAUM and NMELC have been filing additional evidence supporting their human \nrights abuse allegations. Because of its historic disdain for international human rights law, the U.S. government \nrefused to submit its own evidence on the merits. Most recently, ENDAUM and NMELC asked the Commission to \nmake an expedited decision on their Petition merits because the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act has numerous \nprovisions that will incentivize domestic uranium production, putting their communities in imminent danger. Once the \naquifer—their principal source of drinking water—is contaminated by uranium mining, it can never be remediated.\nBY ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY\n Red Water Pond Road Community Association\nThe Red Water Pond Road Community Association continues to struggle against federal regulatory agencies that want to \nkeep radioactive and toxic waste produced by two historic uranium mines and one uranium mill in this small Diné \ncommunity, rather than move it out of Navajo Indian Country. The U.S. EPA and NRC plan to bury waste from one of the\nmine sites on top of waste from the mill less than a mile from peoples’ homes. On Earth Day this year, the Red Water \nPond Road Community hosted the three sitting NRC commissioners to personally demand that the NRC reconsider \nits ill-advised plan. Gale-force winds whipped radioactive dust through the gathering, emphasizing the dangers the \ncommunity faces on a regular basis. Soon after the Commissioners’ visit, the NRC announced it was putting its \npermitting process on hold to re-evaluate the situation. This unprecedented step would not have been possible without \ncommunity engagement and support of allies like the NMELC.  \n \nHomestake Barrick Gold Superfund Site\nBY ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & MIA MONTOYA HAMMERSLEY, STAFF \nATTORNEY\nThe Homestake uranium mill, a designated Superfund site, is a relic of cold war uranium production that has continued \nto affect groundwater quality and community health for over 30 years since it stopped production. Despite Homestake's \ngroundwater remediation efforts—supervised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission—the groundwater contamination from the mill has actually gotten worse. Now, Homestake is signaling \nthat it will apply to the EPA and NRC to walk away from the site without further groundwater restoration \nefforts. NMELC and our clients intend to hold Homestake and regulatory agencies accountable to ensure that \ngroundwater is returned to pre-mining quality. This case has recently received a higher profile thanks to in-depth \ncoverage in national media. NMELC continues to support our clients in meeting with regulating agencies and monitoring \nHomestake's activities. \n\nAfter years of fighting a proposed asphalt batch plant proposed for their community, the Mountain View Coalition \n(Mountain View Neighborhood Association, Mountain View Community Action, and Friends of Valle de Oro National \nWildlife Refuge) may be near the end of its struggle. For decades, the Mountain View neighborhood in Albuquerque’s \nSouth Valley has been the location where Albuquerque and Bernalillo County have steered industries that emit air \npollution. As a result, Mountain View and adjacent communities have become overburdened by polluting industries, \nwhich have had a significant impact on community members’ health. In fact, the life expectancy in Mountain View is \nsignificantly lower than in other Albuquerque neighborhoods due to pollution. The proposed New Mexico Terminal \nServices asphalt plant would emit tons of dangerous chemicals and fine particulate matter, but the City of Albuquerque \nEnvironmental Health Department granted the plant’s permit application anyway. The Mountain View Coalition \nappealed the Department’s decision to the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board, and in early \nSeptember, the Hearing Officer on the case recommended the Air Board send the permit back to the Department \nfor reconsideration. The Board will vote on the Hearing Officer’s recommendation in October just after this goes to \nprint. The Mountain View Coalition will continue to pressure the Department to reverse its earlier decision and take an \nimportant step in decreasing Mountain View’s pollution burden. \nMountain View Coalition/NMTS\nBY ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY & MASLYN LOCKE, STAFF ATTORNEY \nCumulative Air Impact Regulation\n \nCumulative impacts—that is, the consideration of environmental and social impacts on a community holistically—have \nbeen called the Holy Grail of environmental justice. Low-income communities and communities of color have \ntraditionally been the dumping grounds for society’s polluting industries. Albuquerque is no different, with \nindustries that generate air pollution, such as asphalt plants, concrete plants, and hydrocarbon storage facilities, \nproliferating in a few working class, BIPOC communities. A coalition of groups from disproportionately impacted \ncommunities has begun, with NMELC assistance, to draft a regulation that would force industry and regulatory agencies \nto take into account the health and environmental impacts of air pollution from existing and anticipated facilities when \nevaluating new air pollution permit applications. The regulation will be a significant step in protecting the health of \nalready overburdened communities.   \nBY BY ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY; MASLYN LOCKE, STAFF \nATTORNEY & MIA MONTOYA HAMMERSLEY, STAFF ATTORNEY\n The Cumulative Air Impact Regulation will be a significant step in \nprotecting the health of already overburdened communities. \n\nBY MASLYN LOCKE, STAFF ATTORNEY & ERIC JANTZ, SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY \nIn July 2021, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) issued an air pollution permit to Associated Asphalt and \nMaterials, LLC (AAM) for the consolidation of two hot mix asphalt batch plant facilities on Santa Fe’s Southside. The \npermit allows the plant to operate up to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during certain parts of the year and does not protect \nthe health of the public with any certainty. The plant is near multiple neighborhoods where most industrial facilities in \nSanta Fe are located, primarily made up of lower-income, young, Spanish-speaking families. \n \nOur clients, Earth Care New Mexico and Linda Marianiello, appealed NMED’s decision to issue the permit to the \nEnvironmental Improvement Board and had a three-day hearing last February. On May 27, 2022 the Hearing Officer \nissued his report and recommendation, agreeing with the community and recommending that the Environmental \nImprovement Board reverse NMED’s decision to issue an air pollution permit to AAM. The Hearing Officer determined \nthat the community met its burden of proof and demonstrated that, as permitted, the AAM facility would cause or \ncontribute to violations of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which would negatively impact the health and \nquality of life of the surrounding community. \n \nEarth Care/Associated Asphalt & Materials\nBY MIA MONTOYA HAMMERSLEY, STAFF ATTORNEY  \nThe Copper Flat Mine is a proposed open-pit copper mine near Hillsboro in Sierra County, which would be operated by New \nMexico Copper Corporation. Mining operations could contaminate groundwater and surface water and severely \ndeplete groundwater in the Lower Rio Grande Basin in a time of increasing water scarcity due to climate change. The \nmine will also leave behind a large pit lake that will exceed water quality standards. NMELC is representing a coalition of \nranches, local watershed associations, and environmental groups in a proceeding before the New Mexico Office of the State \nEngineer, where our clients have protested the transfer of water rights to the mine that would harm our water resources and \nenable polluting mining operations to move forward.\nCopper Flat Mine\n On June 24, 2022, the Environmental Improvement Board sided with \nNMED and the status quo, at the cost of the community.\n \nDespite the Hearing Officer’s recommendation, which validated community concerns, on June 24, 2022, the \nEnvironmental Improvement Board voted to set it aside, siding with NMED and the status quo, at the cost of the\ncommunity. Our clients have decided not to appeal this decision to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, and are instead \ndeveloping a robust environmental justice campaign to best serve Santa Fe’s Southside residents and challenge the broader \nsystemic issues that contribute to the environmental racism in Santa Fe. NMELC will continue to work alongside the \ncommunity in their fight however we are needed, providing legal assistance and advocacy while the community leads the \nway. \n \n\nBY MASLYN LOCKE, STAFF ATTORNEY \nUpper Pecos Watershed Assn./Tererro Mine\nAugustin Plains Ranch Groundwater Transfer\nBY MASLYN LOCKE, STAFF ATTORNEY \nSince 2007, the Law Center has represented community members and groups near Datil, New Mexico, in their protest \nagainst the transfer of 54,000 acre feet/year of groundwater by Augustin Plains Ranch. Datil is halfway between Pie Town \nand the Very Large Array. The Ranch proposes to transport the groundwater out of Catron County to various counties across \nNew Mexico via a 140-mile pipeline for use by unidentified municipal or commercial users, impacting rural water users and \nexposing communities to potential water mining that could change the future of water management in New Mexico. The \nState Engineer has denied the Ranch’s application twice since 2007 because the Ranch has been unable to identify any \nclearly beneficial use for the water, relying entirely on hypothetical future uses that are detrimental to the community\ncurrently relying on the water. In 2019, the District Court upheld the decision of the State Engineer to deny the Ranch’s \napplication because the Ranch was attempting, for the second time, to appropriate groundwater for unspecified purposes to \nthe detriment of current water users. On August 11, 2022, the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the \nDistrict Court, holding that the District Court’s decision to dismiss the Ranch’s case was unfair to the Ranch and an \nabuse of the Court’s discretion. A small group of protestants, along with Catron County, have appealed the decision to the \nNew Mexico Supreme Court, asking the Court to reverse the Court of Appeals decision and address the Court’s failure to \naddress whether the State Engineer’s decision to deny the Ranch’s application due to its speculative nature was appropriate. \nThe Ranch has also appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, requesting the Court order the State Engineer to allow them \nan additional hearing on the application. \nNMELC represents the Upper Pecos Watershed Association, which works in coalition with several other groups including \nthe New Mexico Acequia Association, the New Mexico Acequia Commission, the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance and \nmany individuals, in the fight against the exploration and proposed mining operation near Tererro, New Mexico, in the \nUpper Pecos watershed. Both the exploration and mining would impact traditional farmers in the Pecos who depend on the \nriver to feed their families and community. A Colorado subsidiary of an Australian mining company, Co-Mexico, LLC, is \nseeking to drill 30 exploratory holes in and around the Pecos Watershed, risking contamination of the river and degradation \nof the surrounding area, in search of gold, copper and zinc. On July 12, 2022, the Water Quality Control Commission ruled \nthat the northern part of the Pecos River, along with over 125 miles of rivers in Northern New Mexico, were designated as \nOutstanding National Resource Waters, adding an important layer of protection to the river. We are also currently waiting \nfor the US Forest Service to issue an Environmental Assessment related to the proposed drilling, a process that has been \ndelayed by the effects of the Hermit's Peak and Calf Canyon fires that burned over 341,000 acres in the area and has \nimpacted many community members. Given the already existing impacts of the old Tererro mine and the largest wildfire \nin New Mexico history, plus impacts from any proposed mining in the area, the community is united in its opposition to the \nTererro mine, and NMELC will continue working with clients and community in their fight. \n \n Given the already existing impacts of the old Tererro mine and the largest \nwildfire in New Mexico history, plus impacts from any proposed mining in the \narea, the community is united in its opposition to the Tererro mine\n\nCLIENT HIGHLIGHT\nTularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium\n“We had casualties from Trinity and they were our babies. Babies died and the Federal \nGovernment looked the other way. They had an opportunity to intervene when contacted by a \nhealth care worker who asked for assistance as an unusually high number of babies were dying. \nFor me this is the most egregious part of the Trinity history. It is unconscionable that our own \ngovernment let our babies die and that people, families suffered through the loss.” \n—Tina Cordova, Co-founder/Director \nTularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium\nTularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium\nBY MIA MONTOYA HAMMERSLEY, STAFF ATTORNEY \nNMELC is representing the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium (TBDC), which was founded to advocate for and \ncompile data on the cancers and other diseases that plague the communities impacted by the Trinity Nuclear Test of July 16, \n1945.

Black Lives Matter and others are forcing White \nAmerica to confront its past and the status quo. This is just the beginning \nof the hard process of building a truly equitable and inclusive society.  \nWe’re still in the grip of a global pandemic that has changed everyone’s \n“normal.”  What under the best of circumstances would be a very difficult \nsituation is made exponentially worse by inept federal leadership.  \nAnd alarmingly – although predictably - the pandemic has provided an \nopening for profiteering and wide ranging corruption.  The Trump adminis-\ntration has used the pandemic as an excuse to suspend enforcement of \nenvironmental laws and to give away our tax dollars to corporate cronies.  \nEvents at the New Mexico Environmental Law Center are paralleling \nnational and global events.  We continue our internal work to make the Law \nCenter a more equitable, diverse and inclusive organization.  \nWe are also adapting to a new “normal” at the office.  Law Center staff has \nadapted to virtual meetings and a remote work environment.  We will \ncontinue to adapt as New Mexico and the country slowly begin to re-open.  \nDespite all the turmoil around us, our commitment to New Mexico remains \nconstant.  The Law Center continues to work with communities to ensure \nthat all New Mexicans have the clean air, land and water that we are \nentitled to.  Our staff and members stepped up to get supplies to commu-\nnities in McKinley County hit hard by COVID.  We continue to work with \ncommunities to hold state and federal governments accountable to their \ncommitments to protect natural resources and public health.  And we will \ncontinue to fight any efforts to use the pandemic to further oppress and \nmarginalize communities that are already disproportionally impacted by \npollution.  \nWe thank all our members, supporters and partners for standing with us \nduring these difficult times and look forward to continuing our work for \nenvironmental and social justice.  \nIn solidarity, \nEric Jantz, Interim Executive Director\nDear Friends,\n\n\nGREEN BUSINESS PARTNERS\nWhen Donald Trump announced in \nJanuary that he wanted the \n“cleanest air” and “cleanest water” \nno one really believed him.  But the \nbreathtaking cynicism of his \ncomments cannot truly be \nappreciated until his \nadministration’s record is reviewed. \nDuring Trump’s first 100 days, 23 \nenvironmental rules were rolled \nback. Since 2017, there have been \na total of 64 environmental policy \nrollbacks with 34 still pending as \ndocumented by The New York \nTimes. It’s staggering to \ncontemplate the immense and, in \nsome cases, irreversible damage \ndone to the environment by these \nactions. \nRollbacks Affecting New Mexico:\n> Revoked a rule that prevented \ncoal mining companies from \ndumping debris into local streams. \n> Canceled a requirement for \nreporting methane emissions.\n> Revoked an update to public \nland use planning process.\n> Rejected a ban on a potentially \nharmful insecticide, Chlorpyrifos.\n> Withdrew guidance for federal \nagencies to include greenhouse \ngas emissions in environmental \nreviews.\n> Ordered review and \n“elimination” of rule that protected \ntributaries and wetlands under the \nClean Water Act.\n> Rolled back limits on toxic \ndischarge from power plants into \npublic waterways.\n> Ordered review of rule limiting \nmethane emissions at new oil and \ngas drilling sites.\n> Revoked limits on methane \nemissions on public lands.\n> Delayed a lawsuit over a rule \nregulating airborne mercury \nemissions from power plants.\n“THE CLEANEST AIR, \nTHE CLEANEST \nWATER”: TRUMP'S \nASSAULT ON THE \nENVIRONMENT\n\n\nThe Law Center currently has 25 cases \non the docket. \nRed Water Pond Road \nBecause the U.S. EPA has suspended \nall field operations during the \npandemic, uranium mine cleanup at the \nRed Water Pond Road community has \nstalled.

It is the start of a brief \npublic comment period on the first day of a permit hearing. The lawyers have made \ntheir opening statements, and the first of several technical experts for the facility \nowner making the permit request has started walking through his long, detailed \nexplanation of why nothing bad is going to happen when the facility is allowed to \noperate. He has a long way to go before he is finished and a staff attorney from the \nNew Mexico Environmental Law Center can cross-examine him.\nAnd then it is time for a break and some public comment. Names on the sign-up \nlist are called. The first person comes to the microphone and starts: “I’m just a \nresident and there are all these experts here, but I wanted to let you know that I’m \nworried about this facility and my children and grandchildren.”\nThese are people that the Law Center represents: \npeople living near proposed mines, dairies, haz-\nardous waste dumps, bulk fuel facilities, massive \nplanned sprawl developments, or large ground-\nwater withdrawal sites. People who will be  \nimpacted by changes to water quality standards, \nby air quality permits that do not acknowledge  \nthe cumulative impact from prior permits,  \nby changes to the rules that will make their  \nparticipation in decision-making even harder –  \nor impossible. The Law Center helps community \nmembers voice their concerns.\nThere is something very positive and inspiring in \npeople speaking up at a hearing, expressing their \nconcerns to public servants representing regulato-\nry agencies and the government in general. This is \nthe ideal picture of our democracy in action. But \nthe reality is not so simple.\nNot every hearing is held near the site of the facility (or the \nproposed facility), so people might have driven several hours \nfrom a far corner of New Mexico, leaving before daybreak to get \nto the hearing in time to sign up to speak at some unspecified \ntime. Even when the hearing is closer, some people cannot get \ntransportation to the meeting or cannot take the time off from \ntheir work to show up. Many times, the community is divided \nbetween those who believe there will be jobs for their poor com -\nmunity and those who believe the contamination of the water or \nthe air is not worth it. Speaking up in public can be difficult when \nit pits neighbors against each other.\nThen there are those experts and dozens of technical documents \nsupporting and opposing the permit. There can be hundreds of \ndocuments and many motions for a major rule change like the \nDairy Rule or Copper Rule. Not everyone has easy access to all those files, let alone the time to read them and the training \nto understand them.\nJust getting a hearing and a response from a regulatory agency can be difficult.\nIn December 2017, the New Mexico Court of Appeals rebuked \nthe Water Quality Control Commission (WQCC) for its decision \nto uphold the New Mexico Environment Department’s (NMED) \ndenial of a public hearing. Communities for Clean Water (CCW) \nhad repeatedly requested a hearing on a discharge permit for Los \nAlamos National Laboratory. \nThe Court faulted the WQCC for acting “arbitrarily and capricious-\nly” in deciding that CCW’s request did not represent “a substantial \npublic interest”. The Court made three things clear: “substantial” \nis not quantitative, so a request for a hearing from one person can \nbe enough; a request that raises specific questions or cites specific \nissues with data or analysis is “substantial”; and private meetings between NMED and \nstakeholders who have raised specific issues are not a replacement for a public hearing. \nPublic hearings are critical, the Court made clear, because they produce a record neces-\nsary to file an appeal of a faulty permit approval.\nIn 2005, residents of Chaves County filed a civil rights complaint with  \nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) charging NMED with  \ndiscriminatory practices in approving a permit for the Triassic Park \nhazardous waste site near Roswell. [The Law Center is not involved in \nthis case.] In 2017, the EPA reached an agreement with NMED in which \nNMED agreed to develop new public participation and limited English \nproficiency policies. However, the new policies, released in early 2018, \nhave significant flaws, in part the result of NMED refusing to allow \npublic participation in developing the new public participation policies \ndespite repeated requests to participate from members of the public, \nincluding residents of Chaves County.\nTriassic Park was also one of five consolidated cases nation-wide \ncharging EPA under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act with a pattern of dis-\ncriminatory practice in allowing civil rights cases (based on “undue bur-\nden” of pollution in affected communities) to drag on for many years. On  \nApril 2, 2018, a California federal court judge ruled that the EPA must \ninvestigate and provide a preliminary response to civil rights complaints \nwithin 180 days of accepting them, which is what EPA’s own rules state.\nHowever, the EPA is choosing to interpret the Court’s ruling to mean that it must close \nall Title VI cases within 180 days, even when the two sides have begun negotiations \nto try to resolve the issues. This decision by EPA affects one of the Law Center’s cases \ndealing with the cumulative impact of air quality permits issued in the largely Hispanic  \nand low-income South Valley of Albuquerque. EPA has given a deadline for clos-\ning the case, even though our client, SouthWest Organizing Project, and the City of \nAlbuquerque have recently said that they will try to negotiate a solution and the EPA \nshould, therefore, stop the clock.\nThe Law Center is representing Amigos Bravos and the Gila Resources Information \nProject in another effort to protect public participation. We are appealing a change to \nthe Water Quality Act regulations governing discharges to ground water. The change, \nwhich was proposed by the NMED and approved by the WQCC, alters the duration of \nvariances, which allow facilities to avoid compliance with regulations. The new regula-\ntion allows a variance to be granted for “the life of a facility,” instead of being limited to five years, thereby eliminating public \nnotice and an opportunity for a hearing every five years. However, we and our clients were able to persuade NMED not to pro-\nceed with another proposed change. It would have allowed permittees to use “amendments” for “minor changes” in permits \nfor facilities without any public notice or opportunity for a hearing.\nThe regulated industry always gets a seat at the table and always has its voice heard. Our job at the Law Center is to make sure \ncommunity voices are also heard. Thanks to the dedication of our clients and to your support, we are able to stay committed to \ncases that can drag on for years. \n2  www.nmelc.org\nSignificant Milestones in the \nFight for Public Participation\n1990-Solid Waste Act\n1991 and 2005-Solid Waste \nManagement Regulations\nNMELC helped to enact the NM \nSolid Waste Act, which provides \nfor extensive public notice and \npublic participation when a \ncompany applies for a permit for \na solid waste facility. NMELC \nwas also heavily involved in the \nenactment of the regulations \nthat implement the Act, which \nprohibit the siting of incinerators \nin communities, and the amend-\nments to those regulations that \nprohibit the siting of solid waste \nfacilities in vulnerable communi-\nties already overburdened with \npolluting facilities.\n1993 - Mining Act \nNMELC helped develop and win \nthe New Mexico Mining Act – \none of the strongest mining laws \nin the nation. Under the Act, \nmining companies must clean up \nmines and post realistic financial \nbonds to the government for \ncleanup if the company can’t (or \nwon’t) complete reclamation. \nIf the agency fails to enforce, \nresidents can sue. In addition, \nthe Act provides substantial \nopportunities for the public to \nparticipate when companies seek \npermits to operate mines. \n2005 - Rhino Decision \nNMELC helped win the signifi-\ncant “Rhino” decision from the \nNM Supreme Court. The ruling \nrequires regulators to take public \ninput into account (not just re-\ncord input) when making deci-\nsions about solid waste facilities. \nSouth Valley Acequia leader, Santiago Maestas, \n speaks at Commission hearing.\nProtest march before a Santolina development hearing.\n3\nNMELC Executive Director Doug Meiklejohn speaks with  \nresidents opposing the Augustin Plains Ranch water grab.\n\nEsther Abeyta was born and raised in the San Jose neighborhood in Albuquerque’s South Valley. Although she left for nine \nyears to live in Colorado, she and her husband Steven returned home in 1999.\nHer grandmother’s house, where they were going to live, needed a lot of work. Esther called her brother and asked if he \ncould fix up the back room for her daughter, so she would have a nice room, and Esther and Steven would get to the rest \nof the house as they could. When they arrived, they found a completely remodeled house.\n“When people heard I was coming back, friends I’d grown up with, neighbors, they remodeled this whole house, the whole \nhouse was gutted and redone. People helped however they could. These are people I hadn’t seen for years.”\nSteven and Esther gradually became immersed in the environmental issues of their community, through the neighborhood \nassociation and eventually with individual campaigns – they began fighting against a waste transfer station, the Honstein \nbulk fuel facility, and the Sunport Boulevard Extension, which includes a second component that would continue the \nextension from Broadway down Woodward Road to 2nd Street. The New Mexico Environmental Law Center represents \nthe Abeytas for both the Honstein air quality permit and the Sunport Extension project.\nDiscussion about the Sunport Extension began in 2010, but it was a proposed “recycling” facility in 2011 that first got their \nfull attention. They thought a “recycling” facility would be a good environmentally friendly business. When Esther started \nlooking into it, she discovered a request for proposals that the city put out to run a waste transfer station that would collect \nthe trash from all over the City, sort out the recyclable materials, and then ship the rest to the City’s waste dump.\nOne company hired a former County Commissioner to represent it to the community. “He was Hispanic, so they thought \nwe would trust him,” laughed Esther. The company promised lots of jobs.\n“But when I looked at the documents they had to file to get their bid approved,” continued Esther, “I saw that the manage-\nment was going to be paid a lot of money, but the people who did the sorting – and I read that it is one of the worst jobs \nbecause you can get sick from it – they were going to be paid really low wages and no benefits.”\nThe eye-opener for the Abeytas came in 2012 when Bernalillo County Place Matters, working with the Joint Center for \nPolitical and Economic Studies, engaged the community to produce a comprehensive analysis of the social, economic, and \nenvironmental conditions in Bernalillo County and their relationship to the health status of the county’s residents. [At the \ntime, Place Matters was directed by Kitty Richards, a Law Center Board member since 2012.]\n“One of the requirements of the Health Impact Assessment was that we had to read it when it was done,” explained Steven. \n“We read it and said, ‘Oh no!’”\n“We’d always known people got sick – ‘they got cancer’, ‘she got cancer’, ‘my uncle got cancer,’ everybody got cancer. So \nwe went outside and drove around the neighborhood and, wow, everything in the Health Impact Assessment was true. All \nthese industries, refineries, the shredding, all over this location.”\n“I think back now,” added Esther, “to when I was growing up and I had friends of mine, their mothers died of cancer, my \nfriend’s sister died of cancer, and I never made the connection until I got involved with the environmental issues in San \nJose.”\nThe Sunport case is critically important for the Abeytas. One access into their neighborhood is off of Woodward Road close \nto the entrance to a recent rail transloading facility and the intersection with 2nd Street. Up the street, closer to Broadway, \nis the entrance to the former General Electric plant (and before that, an Air Force manufacturing facility) along with several \nother former industries that have contaminated the groundwater in the area.\n“THIS IS OUR HOME...”  \nAn interview with Esther and Steven Abeyta  \n“All these places ... polluted the groundwater. They closed the acequias here because they were connected to the aquifer. \nThey closed people’s wells; they had to hook up to the City. I remember growing up [in the 80s], the Air Force would spray \nthis water to keep the dust down – it was all dirt roads around here – and we would run behind the trucks. And they would \nspray up into the trees. They said they were spraying to kill the cicadas. My mother wouldn’t let us outside when they were \nspraying.”\nIn a 2010 transit analysis, the conclusion was that if Sunport Boulevard were extended beyond the I-25 freeway, then it \nshould only run down to Broadway. There was no justification for going farther across Broadway down Woodward to 2nd \nStreet. There were concerns about running the route through the South Valley Superfund site just west of the freeway. And, \ndespite the County being designated the lead on the Sunport project, much of the land for that project and all the land for \nthe Woodward addition is within the City.\nDespite these issues, the County has resolutely pursued the Sunport project, hiring contractors to produce three \nEnvironmental Assessments (EAs). The first did not include the Woodward section, so a second one was done. That version \ntreated the two plans as separate projects and was rejected by the Federal Highway Administration, which prohibits “seg-\nmenting” projects because it does not allow for assessing the impact of the whole project. The third EA is being finalized \nnow.\nThere are also Environmental Justice (EJ) issues. “We’re already overburdened with oil refineries and asphalt batching, the \ncrusher companies, the auto junkyards,” said Steven.\n“There was a recycling convention we were invited to,” continued Steven (“No, we heard about it, so we went,” Esther \njumped in – they often do that when you talk with them: complete the others’ sentences, add details or make corrections). \n“So we signed up,” Steven continued, “and we took some of the courses and we talked to some of the people there and they \ntold us: ‘If Sunport goes in, we’re going to locate there.’ We’re talking about auto dismantlers, shredders ... Who’s going to \nwant to locate next to an oil refinery or an asphalt batching plant?”\nSteven explained how the system works in their neighborhood.\n“An industry comes in, applies for a permit, the industry gets the permit. Another industry comes in, applies for a permit, \nthey get approved. It’s always the same thing. The community always opposes. We do our best, but with limited resources, \nwe’re unable to win the big battles.”\nEsther told the story of how the Law \nCenter first began to represent them. They \nhad called the Law Center back in 2011 \nabout the recycling facility. Director Doug \nMeiklejohn met with them in Albuquerque, \nbut explained that none of the staff attor-\nneys had the time to take on the work. He \ndid give them advice on how to address \nthe issues with the facility. “And it really \nhelped,” said Esther, “because they ended \nup not building in San Jose.”\nThen the Sunport project began gathering \nsteam and the first of the three EAs came \nout, saying the project wouldn’t cause any \nsignificant problems in the neighborhood. \nEsther continued the story.\ncontinued on page 6\n4   www.nmelc.org  5\nEsther and Steven with NMELC staff attorney Eric Jantz  \nat an Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Air Quality Board meeting.\n\nMarla Painter and Mark Rudd have long been a dynamic \nduo in the fight for environmental justice, but they worked \non many similar issues in Albuquerque for years before they \nactually met.\nMarla was doing community organizing across the West, \nworking on military and Department of Energy issues such \nas land appropriation for bases and military exercises and \nthe Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. She looked for \n“unlikely allies”, bringing together ranchers, miners, envi-\nronmentalists, peace activists, and Native Americans. Having \nbeen to Albuquerque for meetings and hearings, she stayed \non in 1997. Mark had started doing student organizing against \nthe Vietnam War and for free speech in the 1960s before com-\ning to Albuquerque in 1982. \nMarla had heard of Mark, but they had never met until a mu-\ntual friend introduced them. Marla “thought he was going to \nbe a sexist, misogynist revolutionary,” she admits, but found instead that “he’s a rather evolved guy.”\nThey both acknowledge the position they are in, living and trying to organize in Albuquerque’s South Valley. “It’s weird,” \nMarla says, “being a person of privilege living with people who often feel powerless.” Mark added that it was eye-open-\ning, coming from places that are wealthy and at least outwardly well-regulated to one of the most polluted areas in New \nMexico, with no sign of regulation and with industrial facilities backed up directly against family residences.\nThe first issue they worked on together was the Vulcan aggregate rock crushing facility, about the year 2000, but there have \nbeen many other neighborhood and environmental justice issues since then. Many of those issues have brought them into \npartnership with the New Mexico Environmental Law Center. “The Law Center came to our rescue because community \nmembers in the South Valley don’t always have the wherewithal to fight environmental injustice. The Law Center was the \nonly source of help and hope.”\nMark added that the most valuable thing about the Law Center is that it is very clear about its role. “Legal expertise is only \none aspect of seeking environmental justice,” he said. “There are political and advocacy aspects as well. The Law Center \nunderstands this and integrates its legal work as an equal partner with the community and doesn’t get in the way of the \nother activities.”\n“We can’t express adequately our appreciation for what the Law Center does,” Marla added. “As donors, we understand \nthat giving to lawyers isn’t sexy or exciting to people. It’s always the hardest money to raise. We strongly encourage people \nto realize this and contribute. ” Thank you, Marla and Mark!\nInterview with Steve and Esther Abeyta continued from page 5\n“I told the County I was going to stop this project. I’m going to stop this project! I didn’t know how I was going to do this. \nI was excited, I was afraid, right here I thought, God how am I going to do this? And then all of a sudden I got this email, \nfrom [Law Center staff attorney] Jon Block, and he was trying to find out what ever happened with the advice that Doug \ngave us. So I told him what happened with that [and about Sunport]. So he says, ‘well send me the information, and I’ll look \nat it’ and then I guess he looked at the document and he says ‘well, you know we’re going to help you’. So I guess that’s \nwhy I say Jon is my angel. Honestly, Jon’s my angel.”\nBoth Steven and Esther say that people ask them all the time why they keep fighting. Why don’t they leave. “But the whole \nthing is, that kind of discouragement and despair, even though it’s felt in the community, we’ve been able to exert some \nfortitude to continue on with this particular fight.” Steven laid out the options as he sees them.\n“You can flee your community, but you’ll abandon your neighbors and sell your home to somebody else, but what if their \nchild gets sick? That’s on you. Or you can live in bliss, deny anything is going on, but the problem persists. Or you can \nmake the ultimate choice. You’re going to fight, fight, fight. You’re going to have to keep fighting even though you’re losing. \nBecause we can’t run and we can’t hide.”\nEsther took a deep breath, hesitated a moment, then continued the thought.\n“I agree with what Steven said, but for me it’s a little different. This is my home. My grandmother lived here, my mother \nlives up the street. I went to school here, I went to church here, I have memories here.”\nIn 2017, the New Mexico Environmental Law Center awarded Esther and Steven Abeyta the Jeanne Gauna Award for community \nenvironmental activism.\n6  www.nmelc.org\nCome by our office (1405 Luisa St, Suite 5, in Santa Fe) to pick up a fair trade bar ($5 each)\n– or gift packs of three!

Water, however, is a scarce resource in this state. The \nwater we have is essential. Nine out of ten New Mexicans depend on underground supplies for their \ndrinking water. Water quantity and quality are critical to our public health and environment.”\nThis statement is as true today as it was 28 years ago, but we take up the responsibility to protect this most \nprecious resource with more urgency than ever before.\nDavid Gutzler, a professor at UNM and an internationally respected expert on the impacts of climate change \nin New Mexico and the Southwest, testiﬁ  ed earlier this year for the Law Center in our Aquifer Science water \nspeculation case in Albuquerque’s East Mountains. His conclusion was bleak. Rising temperatures, shrinking \nsnow packs, and an expanding population indicate that access to clean water may be the greatest challenge \nfacing New Mexico in the coming decades.\ncontinued on page 4\nWATER\nWATER\nWATER\nWATER\nWATER\nWATER\n WOES\nWOES\nWOES\nWOES\nWOES\nWOES\nink well\nproductions\nink well\nproductions\nBERNARD EWELL ART APPRAISALS, LLC\nTHE INTERNATIONAL SALVADOR DAL Í  EXPERT\nKESHI\nthe zuni connection\nThe mad potter\n\n\n2  www .nmelc.org\nWater: Our Irreplaceable Resource\nAnyone who lives in New Mexico knows that the state has serious water problems. The \nmost obvious problem is that there is not enough water. Less obvious, at least to a casual \nobserver, is pollution of surface water. Even less obvious, because it occurs underground, \nis the mining and pollution of groundwater. However, the most insidious and serious \nproblem of all may be the refusal of political decision makers to take into account what it \nreally means to live in an arid state.\n \nNew Mexico had a record low snowpack this year, which translates to very low runoff into \nour rivers. The Rio Grande south of Socorro began drying up several months early and \npredictions are that 120 miles of it will be dry this summer, including possibly the parts \nof the river in the Albuquerque area. Global warming is making these shortages of surface water the “new normal”.\n \nWater that cannot be used because it is contaminated also diminishes our supplies. Sometimes, water pollution is \nobvious as in the case of the spill from the Gold King Mine in Colorado that turned the Animas River bright orange. \nIn many cases, pollution is not so obvious. Many of our rivers are brown with sediment, but the real problem is the \nindustrial metals and PCBs attached to the sediments, along with bacteria and excess nutrients from animal waste and \nleaking septic systems.\n \nGroundwater today is the source of drinking water for the vast majority of New Mexicans, with the amount of ground-\nwater pumping set to expand rapidly in the coming decades. New Mexico therefore must treat its groundwater as the \nirreplaceable resource that it is. Unfortunately, the state is doing exactly the opposite. First, New Mexico’s groundwater \nresources are being mined; they are being extracted at rates faster than they are recharged. Second, large amounts of \ngroundwater have already been polluted by copper, uranium, and molybdenum mines, the national nuclear laborato-\nries, and Kirtland Air Force Base. Once groundwater is polluted, it is very difficult and expensive to clean.\n \nSurface and groundwater are inextricably linked. Inadequate irrigation water from the Rio Grande led to greatly \nincreased groundwater pumping in the southern part of the state. This lowered the water table near the river, causing \nthe river to lose water that Texas claims it is owed under the Rio Grande Compact. Texas has sued New Mexico in the \nUS Supreme Court and was recently joined by the federal government. Early indications are that the case is not going \nwell for New Mexico. If the state loses, it may have to provide massive monetary compensation and more water to Texas \nto make up for past delivery shortages. This would be disastrous for New Mexico.\n \nDespite all of these issues, New Mexico’s political decision makers continue to act as if the state has water resources to \nspare. The Martinez administration Copper Rule authorizes copper mines to pollute the groundwater in the “capture \nzones” created by their open pit mines; the “capture zone” at one of the largest mines in Grant County covers about nine \nsquare miles. The developers of the proposed Santolina development on the west side of Albuquerque have violated \nthe requirement to identify where the water for this development would come from. Nevertheless, the majority of the \nBernalillo County Board of County Commissioners has approved it at every step of the process. The Mt Taylor uranium \nmine has not produced since 1990 and has contaminated groundwater. Rather than being forced into reclamation, the \nstate has given the mine operator a permit to return to “active” status. In addition, the Mining and Minerals Division \nacknowledges that at least half of all known abandoned uranium mines in New Mexico have never had any reclamation \nwork done on them.\n \nThese approaches must change. New Mexico does not have unlimited amounts of water, and the amounts of surface \nand groundwater available to New Mexicans will continue to decrease as global warming continues. Unless New \nMexico’s elected decision makers recognize these facts, the state’s water woes will continue to increase.\n Yours truly,\n \n Doug\nThe Law Center is blessed to have the most interesting, educated and compassionate  \ndonors in all New Mexico, and Helenty Homans is no exception. \nAt age 92, she’s been a few places, seen a few things, and developed a few ideas. \nShe grew up in Prague until the age of 12, when her family emigrated in 1938.  \nAfter some time in Canada, they ended up in Boston. There, Helenty (whose given  \nname is Helen) met a New Mexican named Mary Riseley (also a Law Center supporter).  \nWhen Mary returned to New Mexico, she and Helenty stayed in touch, and after \nfour years Helenty found herself in Colorado and took the opportunity to visit Mary.  \nAs is true with so many New Mexican stories, Helenty “just loved the place” , she recalls. “It reminded me of Europe. ”  \nHelenty went back to Boston to get her dog, and returned to the Santa Fe area where she found several house-sitting gigs. \nEventually, she bought a house on four acres north of town in Jacona – where she lives to this day. (Her daughter Dee – also \na Law Center supporter – and her son Rick lived in Albuquerque’s South Valley for a time before moving to Tampa, FL.) \n“There have been so many changes” since buying her home 45 years ago, Helenty notes. “I wanted to give something back” \nand preserve something of the community. So she gave her four-acre property to the Santa Fe Community Housing Trust. \nNow Helelnty’s home is joined by three other affordable family homes on two acres of the property. The other two acres \nare devoted to small-scale farming – handled by Mr. G., who sells his produce at the weekly Santa Fe Farmers Market. \nHelenty has four charitable giving priorities: animal causes; affordable housing; small-scale farming and environmen-\ntalism. She has been a supporter of the Law Center’s environmental justice work since 1991 – giving through a donor- \nadvised fund in her name at the Santa Fe Community Foundation – and has a particular interest in the impacts of  \nmining on the environment and communities in New Mexico. She also is concerned about contamination from activities at \nthe Los Alamos National Laboratory. We are honored to have Helenty’s loyal support as we fight on these important fronts.  \nThank you, Helenty!\nYou can become a member by making a donation of only $10\nor more per month.\nWhen you join the Law Center’s \nCLUB DOUG,* you not only receive \na free “Doug Mug”, but you become \na part of a dedicated community of \nsupporters reaching out each month \nto help ensure that we can continue \nfighting to protect our state’s air, land, \nand water for the long term.\nMonthly recurring donations can easily be set up online at  \nnmelc.org or by calling Grace Aroha at (505) 989-9022, ext 119. \n*As you can see, Doug has no control over the wildly creative ways in which his name is used around here. \nHe laments that being Executive Director means that he is directed by the Staff – this is a prime example!\n7\nJoin the Law Center’s CLUB DOUG!*\nNewest Office Dog\nArlo is a 10-month old Blue Heeler \nrescue with suspiciously large ears.\nGenetic testing is in order.

After 28 years in southern \nCalifornia, it seemed the time to move \nto a quieter place with less commotion. \nBesides, living in a rural area would be \nan adventure.\n \nOur location in the Datil mountains is \none of the most beautiful places in the \ncountry. The Plains of San Augustin \nseem to ﬂ  ow endlessly below the dis-\ntant mountains that surround them, the \nsky arching overhead. This is ranching \ncountry with large spreads around us, \nthe open land serene and quiet. Several \ngenerations of families have lived and \nranched the land and these families \nhave a dedication to this way of life. \nThose who, like ourselves, are new-\ncomers to this rural community, share \nin that love of this place.\n \n“El agua es la vida.”\nThat dedication shows up in the ﬁ  ght to save the Augustin Plains aquifer. Going on 11 years, this community, which \nincludes those of us who are not ranchers as well as those who are, has fought an attempt to mine the waters of the \nbasin that sustains us. A corporate entity has applied to take 54,000 acre feet of water each year from the basin and send \nit via pipeline to Albuquerque. That application threatens the community, the economy, the culture and our very lives \nshould it be approved. We are ﬁ  ghting to maintain our adopted community, knowing that this land could sustain us \nand our families forever.\n \nEl agua es la vida. The stakes are high, and should this application to mine water here be approved, all of New Mexico’s \nrural communities will be threatened by the precedent it will set. We will live or die on the decision of the State \nEngineer, so serious is this threat to our well-being. Perhaps we should all ask: is this a decision that one man should \nmake? Shouldn’t we ourselves have a say in the future of our communities? We would like to think that is possible.\n \nEditor’s note: The Law Center represents Ray & Carol Pittman and approximately 80 other residents in this decade-long ﬁ  ght.\nCLIENT SPOTLIGHT - Ray & Carol Pittman \nThank you   to all of ou  r suppor  ter  s who don  ated so gener  ou  sly - making it\n possible for   the Law Center   to bring on   new staff so we can mor  e str  ategically \nmanage ou  r ever  -gr  ow  ing load of water  -related cases.\nNEW STAFF\n6   www .nmelc.org\nCharles de Saillan, Staff Attorney \nCharles de Saillan started work with the Law Center on June 4, 2018. He joins us from the \nNew Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, where he worked for over 4 years. Before moving \nto New Mexico, Charlie worked at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice De-\npartment in Washington, D.C., handling enforcement litigation under the Clean Water Act, \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act, and federal hazardous waste laws.\nCharlie moved to New Mexico in 1993 to work for Attorney General Tom Udall. He helped \ndevelop the state’s natural resource damage program and led a national attorney general work \ngroup to retain strong liability and cleanup provisions in the Superfund program. In 1999, \nCharlie moved to the Environment Department where he worked on enforcement and per-\nmitting actions involving hard rock mines, petroleum refi  neries, electric power plants, and \nthe nuclear weapons laboratories. Notably, he negotiated the 2005 Consent Order for comprehensive investigation and cleanup \nof pollution at Los Alamos National Laboratory.\nCharlie holds a Bachelor of Arts from Boston University, a Juris Doctor from Boston University School of Law, and an LL.M. \nin Energy and Environmental Law from Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven, Belgium. He has numerous publications in the fi  eld \nof environmental law. Charlie enjoys many outdoor activities and is a photographer. For several years he was a volunteer with \nSt. John’s College and Atalaya search and rescue teams. He is on the Board of Conservation Voters New Mexico, and Conser-\nvation Voters N.M. Education Fund.\nNadine Padilla, Law Fellow \nNadine Padilla just graduated from UNM Law School, and will join the Law Center staff   on Septem-\nber 4th to begin a two-year fellowship funded primarily by the Kellogg Foundation.\nNadine, who is Navajo and Pueblo (Isleta/Laguna) from Bluewater Lake, NM, has a unique under-\nstanding of and sensitivity to the many complexities involved in addressing environmental concerns \nof Indigenous communities.\nBefore law school, Nadine worked with the Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment (one of \nour clients) to protect Mt. Taylor, a mountain sacred to her community, from proposed uranium \nmining. Nadine has one son, Noah (4 yo), and they love to read, swim, do puzzles, and go for walks \ntogether. She was Editor-in-Chief for the Natural Resources Journal, a writing tutor for fi  rst year law \nstudents, a volunteer with the Native American Law Student Association, and a Teaching Assistant \nfor the Pre-Law Summer Institute program. Nadine received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Fort Lewis College in Durango, \nColorado, and her Master’s in Communication from Gonzaga University.\nKendra Palmer, Paralegal\nKendra Palmer is a certifi  ed paralegal with a passion for environmental protection in New \nMexico. She comes to us from a similar position with the First Judicial District Court in Santa \nFe, where she worked for almost eight years. Prior to that, Kendra worked as a paralegal for a \nlaw offi   ce in Austin, Texas.\nIn her free time, Kendra enjoys camping, hiking, photography, small-scale urban farming, \nmusic, and sewing. Kendra is currently attending the Santa Fe Community College and will \ngraduate this summer with a Certifi  cate in Paralegal Studies. She will begin work at the Law \nCenter in mid-July.\n\n\n \nIn the years after its founding in 1987, most of the Law Center’s cases dealt with land habitat con-\nservation. However, by the early 90’s, the Center’s mission began to shift to environmental justice \nas it became clear that New Mexico’s communities desperately needed accessible and responsible \nlegal representation to deal with environmental and public health harms. Minority, rural, and \nlow-income communities are most likely to suff  er the eff  ects of contamination; they are also the \nmost likely to be targeted in water grabs by high-proﬁ  le private interests that threaten future pub-\nlic supplies, and are often the ﬁ  rst to experience conﬂ  ict around who owns and controls the rights \nto water in our state. They are also likely to suff  er most from climate change impacts.\nMany of the battles we are ﬁ  ghting today date back years and even decades. In 1988, the Law \nCenter took on its ﬁ  rst water case, advising Los Amigos Del Rio about monitoring Santa Fe Alloy’s \nattempts to get permits to process thorium from rare earth oxides, a process that could have seri-\nously aff  ected water quality along the Pecos near San Jose. Other early cases dealt with fuel leaks \nfrom underground storage tanks, the toxic waste at Los Alamos, and contamination from improp-\ner waste disposal.\nMining: The Greatest Source of Water Pollution in NM\nThe most signiﬁ  cant water cases in the Law Center’s history have had to do with the pollution \ncaused by mining and drilling activities that have predominantly aff  ected Native populations in \nNew Mexico. In 1979, 95 million gallons of radioactive waste spilled into the Rio Puerco, ﬂ  owing \nthrough the Diné (Navajo) Reservation, through the towns of Church Rock and Gallup. The Law \nCenter took up the challenge in the early 1990’s and began representing Eastern Navajo Diné \nAgainst Uranium Mining (ENDAUM) in cases against industry and the government. ENDAUM \nand the Law Center won several major victories, including signiﬁ  cant strengthening of New \nMexico’s uranium groundwater standard (2004), and adoption of the Navajo Natural Resources \nProtection Act, which bans uranium mining on Navajo lands (2005).\nOne of the most signifi  cant victories in the Law Center’s history came in 1993 \nwhen we played a pivotal role in passing the New Mexico Mining Act.  Before the \npassage of this act, there were very few laws that regulated mining activities in New Mexico. \nHowever in 1993, when the Rio Galisteo ran foul with cyanide leaking from Cunningham Hill \nmine, Law Center founder Douglas Meiklejohn helped draft a new law that requires all hard-rock \nmines to develop reclamation plans, to restore surrounding land to self-sustaining ecosystems, \nand to post ﬁ  nancial assurance adequate to cover the costs of reclamation. Since the Mining Act’s \npassage, no irresponsible proposal for a new hard-rock mine has been permitted in the state. In \naddition, we have been able to get substantial partial reclamation at copper mines in Grant \nCounty and were able to get the largest mining reclamation bond in the country at the time for \nthe Molycorp (now Chevron Mining) molybdenum mine in Questa. The copper mines owned \nby Freeport McMoRan now have the largest ﬁ  nancial assurance bonds in the country.\nWhere We Stand Now\nThe eff  orts to protect our current resources from contamination have been more diffi   cult \nunder Governor Susana Martinez’s administration, which seeks to protect big polluters at the \nexpense of public health and the environment. Her administration has weakened protections \nof groundwater, limited the ability of members of the public to participate, and made the oil \nand gas industry essentially self-regulating.\nThe following are some of the most signiﬁ  cant groundwater protection issues facing New \nMexico and the Environmental Law Center now:\n• Copper Rule   In a confusing and frustrating decision, the NM Supreme Court upheld \nthe Copper Rule in March of this year, allowing companies to exclude the area beneath\nopen pit mines from water quality standards, creating water sacriﬁ  ce zones. We will now look \nat copper mine operations on a case-by-case basis and seek to rescind or modify the Rule.\n4   www .nmelc.org  5\n • Mt. Taylor Mine   The Law Center has appealed a “return to active” permit granted for the \nmine, which has not produced uranium ore since 1990 and will not produce ore during the permit \nperiod. The mine ought to be closed and reclaimed. Instead, the NM Mining and Minerals Division \nhas created a new category of “zombie mines” that neither produce nor clean up.\n \n• Kirtland Air Force Base Plume    After two decades, the US Air Force has neither \nfully characterized the toxic fuel plume nor achieved signiﬁ  cant cleanup. The spill threatens the \nmost productive drinking water well ﬁ  eld in Albuquerque. In February, the NM Environment \nDepartment supported an Air Force report that has serious deﬁ  ciencies in data collection, analysis, \nand proposed actions. We are exploring our options with our clients.\n \n• Aquifer Science   The water developer continues to pursue a permit to pump 1,500 acre-\nfeet of water annually for a proposed residential resort in Albuquerque’s East Mountains. The plan \nis clearly out-of-state water speculation. In March 2018, the Law Center went to court citing seri-\nously ﬂ  awed modeling used to support the permit and the fact that the State Engineer has already \ndeclared that there is no available new water. We are waiting for the judge’s decision.\n \n• Augustin Plains Ranch   The Law Center argued in front of the State Engineer’s Hearing \nOffi   cer against granting Augustin Plains Ranch a permit to extract nearly 17 billion gallons of \ngroundwater per year from the San Augustin Basin, west of Socorro. An Italian billionaire, whose \nprevious applications have been rejected because they fail to identify end users and beneﬁ  cial \nuses for the water, owns the ranch. The Water Rights Division attorney said the application was \nspeculative, but the ﬁ  nal decision now rests with the State Engineer.\n \n• Copper Flat Mine    We won a victory in a water rights case that awarded only a small \nfraction of the water the mine’s owners were attempting to claim. Now, we are challenging the \nmine permit itself on both procedural grounds and on the basis of problems with the hydrologic \ndata and modeling used to support the permit. \n \n• Water Quality Rules    The NM Environment Department petitioned the Water Quality \nControl Commission (WQCC) to change a number of water quality rules. We succeeded in getting \nsome of the problematic changes withdrawn prior to the hearing, but there are still some serious \nissues. We have just ﬁ  led our exceptions (comments) to the Hearing Offi   cer’s Report and are wait-\ning for the WQCC’s decision.\n \n• Santolina  The Bernalillo County Planning Commission and Bernalillo County Board \nof County Commissioners have approved every step of the master-planned community approval\nprocess, even though the developer and the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility \nAuthority have not produced the required Development Agreement detailing how the devel-\nopment, which will have more than 90,000 people, will get its water. We recently ﬁ  led our \nbrief with the Court of Appeals concerning the faulty county process as well as the incorrect \ndecision by the District Court in not reviewing those decisions.\n• Public Participation  In a critical decision that will have an impact on all our water \nwork, the Court of Appeals found that the WQCC had erred in upholding the Environment \nDepartment’s decision to deny a public hearing on a discharge permit for a facility at Los \nAlamos National Laboratory. The Court stated that public participation is an inherent part of \nthe permit process by forcing agencies to defend their decisions. Public hearings also create a \nrecord that is necessary to appeal a decision in the courts.\nThe Law Center depends on – and defends – public participation as the ﬁ  rst line of defense \nagainst polluters and agencies that fail to protect the environment and public health. We all \ndepend on those individuals and community organizations who take the time and trouble to \npay attention, show up at meetings, and protest against actions that harm the environment \nand their community. It is an honor to represent them when legal representation is necessary.\ncontinued from front cover\nWATER\n WOES", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "819898b463dd56389af57433234239270ba2e3d4ae57d7b3331edd9fe1c607f3", "out_path": "raw/pdf/https_nmelc.org_wp-content_uploads_2018_07_GFR-Summer-2018-sm.pdf.pdf", "notes": null, "tags": ["pdf"]}

And that’s before Congress gets around to \ngutting federal laws. \nThe federal government doesn’t regulate everything, \nhowever. New Mexico employees handle many \nenvironmental matters: groundwater quality, air quality \nand hazardous waste are just some of the issues under \ntheir jurisdiction. For the past six years, the Martinez \nadministration has worked hard to weaken \nenvironmental protections and erode the public’s ability \nto participate in decision-making. And it’s about to get \nworse, currently the New Mexico Environment \nDepartment receives 27% of its $79 million annual budget \nfrom the federal government. Amidst the uncertainty, \nwhat we do know is that public interest lawyers play an \nimportant role in times like these. As we’ve seen with \nGovernor Martinez, politicians have a habit of adopting \nunconstitutional policies and regulations. The Law Center \ngives New Mexicans the ability to challenge them when \nthey do. \nYEARS\nThe Yes M en are Com ing \nto celebrate 30 years of \nfighting for environm ental \njustice in N ew  M exico \nStay Tuned. \nF or spon sorsh ip opportun ities, \ncon tact E lizabeth  L ee: \n505.989.9022 or \nelee@ nm elc.org \nThe Yes M en are a culture jam m ing activist duo and netw ork of supporters created by Jacques Servin and Igor Vam os.

But \nwe believe that there will be widespread fallout that \nwill touch everything from the air we breathe and the \nwater we drink to civil rights. The one thing we know \nis that it’s going to be a tough fight for the next couple \nof years under two administrations (state and federal) \nthat put little value on environmental protection. \nWhile we work to defend our state, we know that Trump \nhas installed leadership antithetical to agency missions, \nwill defund agencies, slash staffing and muzzle those \nwho remain. These are the folks who protect New Mexico’s \nsurface water; who are tasked with enforcing environ -\nmental justice; and who have been working to address \nclimate change at the national and international levels. \nIn addition, federal agencies, especially the Department \nof Energy and Department of Defense, have created \nsignificant environmental liabilities in our state.

New Mexico employees handle many \nenvironmental matters: groundwater quality, air quality \nand hazardous waste are just some of the issues under \ntheir jurisdiction. For the past six years, the Martinez \nadministration has worked hard to weaken \nenvironmental protections and erode the public’s ability \nto participate in decision-making. And it’s about to get \nworse, currently the New Mexico Environment \nDepartment receives 27% of its $79 million annual budget \nfrom the federal government. Amidst the uncertainty, \nwhat we do know is that public interest lawyers play an \nimportant role in times like these.

The new\nConsent Order, signed in July,\nabolishes hard deadlines, replacing\nthem with targets that would be\nnegotiated each year through a\nclosed process between NMED,\nthe Department of Energy and the\nLab operator.

Then, through a mutual friend, he met the Santa Fe artist\nwho would become his wife, Vicki Laszlo. That sped up the process a\nbit, and Paul moved to Santa Fe full-time in 2012.\nIn the meantime, through another set-up, he was introduced to the Law\nCenter, and another kind of partnership began. One of his oldest friends\nin Colorado introduced Paul to Dale Pontius, a former Law Center\nBoard member. When Dale mentioned the Law Center, Paul’s interest\nwas piqued. He had always done pro bono work, and wanted to get\ninvolved in such work in New Mexico. He had already taken and passed\nthe New Mexico bar. So Dale introduced Paul to Doug Meiklejohn.\nThe first case that came up was Aquifer Science v. Verhines, a case\ninvolving an attempted groundwater appropriation by a California-\nbased water speculator that was being handled by former Law Center\nattorney Bruce Frederick. Paul had an interest in water law because it’s\nsuch an important issue in the West. Right before the hearing started,\nBruce and Doug asked Paul if he wanted to assist. He did, and is still\nlending his experience and expertise to the case. After we won the issue\nbefore the State Engineer, the company appealed the decision to District\nCourt in Bernalillo County, with an August 2017 trial date now set.\nAs icing on the cake, Paul and Vicki helped fund the matching gift\namount for the Law Center’s recent Match Madness campaign.\n© Photo by Shelbie Knox\nDouglas Meiklejohn and client Santiago James Maestas,\npresident of the South V alley Regional Association of\nAcequias, share a moment following an April hearing \nin the Santolina sprawl case.\n© Photo courtesy Paul Hultin.

He had always done pro bono work, and wanted to get\ninvolved in such work in New Mexico. He had already taken and passed\nthe New Mexico bar. So Dale introduced Paul to Doug Meiklejohn.\nThe first case that came up was Aquifer Science v. Verhines, a case\ninvolving an attempted groundwater appropriation by a California-\nbased water speculator that was being handled by former Law Center\nattorney Bruce Frederick. Paul had an interest in water law because it’s\nsuch an important issue in the West. Right before the hearing started,\nBruce and Doug asked Paul if he wanted to assist. He did, and is still\nlending his experience and expertise to the case. After we won the issue\nbefore the State Engineer, the company appealed the decision to District\nCourt in Bernalillo County, with an August 2017 trial date now set.\nAs icing on the cake, Paul and Vicki helped fund the matching gift\namount for the Law Center’s recent Match Madness campaign.\n© Photo by Shelbie Knox\nDouglas Meiklejohn and client Santiago James Maestas,\npresident of the South V alley Regional Association of\nAcequias, share a moment following an April hearing \nin the Santolina sprawl case.\n© Photo courtesy Paul Hultin.

Alice became\ninvolved in the fight, organizing a colorful community\nparade (complete with dinosaurs) against big oil, and\ndeveloping a miniature golf course installation called\n“Gas Stations of the Cross”, where players putt from pump\nto pump. Alice got so involved that she even served on\nthe Law Center's board of directors for a couple of years,\nbefore returning full-time to\nher creative work.\nEducated at Harvard and\nBrown, Alice studied painting\nat the Rhode Island Schoolof\nDesign and then printmaking\nin France. In Paris she also\nworked as a journalist and\nradio commentator. She\nmoved to New Mexico the\nclassic way – her car broke\ndown outside of Taos.\n“Gas Stations of the Cross”\nlives on, along with other art-\nwork, at the Sculpture Ranch,\nwhich she established on the\noutskirts of Santa Fe with her\nhusband and sculptor,\nNathaniel Hesse.\nThe \ncompound is also inhabited\nby several horses and one very sweet rescue dog. Inside,\nthe walls are hung with paintings, many of them by Alice\nherself, including a series called Crusader Follies, which\nshe has described as “an extended allegory in paint, a twist\non the link between our oil-driven culture and the horse-\nbased Crusades.”\nAlice's paintings can be seen at \nwww.sculptureranch.org,\nand her short films, produced under the label Ink Well\nProductions, can be viewed on YouTube. \nKirt Kempter\nWe caught Kirt Kempter\njust in time. He was\npreparing to leave for a\n23-day trip around the\nPacific Ocean on a private\nplane as a speaker on an\neducational tour hosted\nby National Geographic.\nThe group’s destinations?\nCosta Rica, Iguazu Falls\n(Brazil), Patagonia,\nEaster Island, New\nZealand, China and Japan. \nKirt is no stranger to global\ntravel. As a geologist, teacher and photographer living \nin Santa Fe, he has spent decades working as a field\ngeologist with projects near home and in Mexico and\nCosta Rica. He leads 7 to 8 tours a year for National\nGeographic, the Smithsonian Institution, and local\norganizations including Southwest Seminars. \nKirt always brings a camera along. His large format \nphotos capture the beauty and scope of Western land-\nscape. Kirt sometimes donates photocanvases to the \nLaw Center for auction, and has been a member since\n2005 when he first heard Doug Meiklejohn speak. \n“I was very impressed,” he recalls. “I knew it was an\norganization I wanted to support. Even though I’m a\ngeologist and have lots of colleagues who went into oil\nand gas, economic geology has never been of interest to\nme. When I study geology and the story of life on the\nearth, it makes me feel more strongly the need to protect\nthe environment. We’re one of over 8 million species on\nthe planet and we have to share it. We need to keep it a\ngood home for everybody.”\nKirt’s photography is available at the Abiquiu Inn and\nThe Pantry in Santa Fe.

But this summer, Augustin\nPlains Ranch, LLC and the State Engineer tried to make the case \nevaporate. You’re making sure we can challenge them.\nOn September 22, 2014, Law Center Staff Attorney Bruce Frederick asked\nthe state Supreme Court to order the State Engineer to deny a second\nwater grab application filed by Augustin Plains Ranch, LLC. (His petition\nfor a writ of mandamus can be found at nmelc.org.)\nBackground: In August, the Ranch and the State Engineer backed out \nof the court appeal over the biggest private water grab attempt in New\nMexico history. The Ranch seeks to acquire 54,000 acre-feet of water per\nyear (afy)–enough water for Albuquerque for six months–to sell to some\nunknown entity sometime in the future.\nUnder normal circumstances, this would be good news for our clients\nand for New Mexico’s water. But the machinations underway suggest\nthat this is a tactic to ditch a legal process that likely would end the\nRanch’s bid and affirm our state’s laws against water speculation.\nBig Money% Big Water% Big Fight\n© Photo courtesy of Juana Colón\n© Photos courtesy of Cole Merrick\ncontinued on pg. 5\n“Our clients and New Mexico taxpayers \nare being penalized by having to start the process \nover again just because the Ranch put a different \nshade of lipstick on this pig. ”– Bruce Frederick, staff attorney\nAugustin Plains basin (top) / Ray Pittman on his ranch (left) / Staff Attorney, Bruce Frederick at a \ncommunity meeting on the water grab in Datil, NM (right)\n\nCase Updates\nT wenty-Seven Y ears of Environmental and Community Victories3\nCase Updates\nClientSpotlight:\nThe drive from Anthony, NM to Santa Fe is about four\nand a half hours.

Law Center members made it possible for us\nto demonstrate that the application was illegally \nspeculative under the New Mexico Constitution\nbecause it said nothing about how, when or by whom\nthe water would be used. Based on that argument, the\nState Engineer denied the Ranch’s application in 2012.\nSix months later, a state District Court Judge upheld\nthe State Engineer’s decision.”\nBut in July, less than a month before the state Court of\nAppeals was scheduled to hear arguments in the case,\nthe Ranch submitted a second application to the Office\nof the State Engineer. Just as before, the Ranch lists no\nspecific end use or buyer for the 54,000 afy of water it\nseeks. The second application is essentially the same\napplication as before,\nand therefore just \nas illegal as the first \napplication.\nStill, seemingly con-\nfident that its second\napplication will be \naccepted, the Ranch \nwithdrew its first \napplication and \ndropped its appeal \ntwo days before its \ncourt date.\n“The Ranch has \nobviously spent a lot of money and time weaving a\ncolorful story about what it might do with this water,”\nsays Frederick. “But no matter how elaborate its story,\nthe Ranch has not satisfied the first requirement for\nappropriating water: showing that it has any actual\npurpose or place of beneficial use for the water. \nOur clients and New Mexico’s taxpayers are being \npenalized by having to start the process over again \njust because the Ranch put a different shade of lipstick\non this pig.” \nWe’ll keep you apprised of the next steps that the Law\nCenter and its clients take to prevent this water grab. \n\nSilver City\nLas Cruces\nCarlsbad\nAlbuquerque\nSanta Fe\nTaos\nGallup\nRoswell\nNMELC 2014 Docket | AUGUST\nCommunity Response (local)\nState-Level casework\nNational-level casework\nItems in red =  cases  closed in 2014\n56-57\nIndustrialDairies\nURANIUM\nOil & Gas\nExtractionHardrockMining\nLos alamoslab\nStatewide Water Po/l_Lution RULES\nRiverConservation\nLocalControl\nWater Grabs\n4 ww w. nmelc.org\nCase Updates\nAs a Law Center member, you’ve been supporting our\nwork to bring international attention to environmental\ninjustice in New Mexico for years.

One of\nour client’s fears is that the 100,000+ person \nsubdivision will suck water out of communities \nand acequias in the South Valley.\nHONSTEIN BULK FUEL DEPOT Albuquerque\nWe also represent SWOP to prevent the issuance of\nan air quality permit to the Honstein Oil Co. for a\nbulk fuel storage facility located in the San Jose\nneighborhood of the South Valley.\nBruce with clients, Ray and Carol Pittman.\nNMELC STAFF\nJonathan M.

Law Center members made it possible for us\nto demonstrate that the application was illegally \nspeculative under the New Mexico Constitution\nbecause it said nothing about how, when or by whom\nthe water would be used. Based on that argument, the\nState Engineer denied the Ranch’s application in 2012.\nSix months later, a state District Court Judge upheld\nthe State Engineer’s decision.”\nBut in July, less than a month before the state Court of\nAppeals was scheduled to hear arguments in the case,\nthe Ranch submitted a second application to the Office\nof the State Engineer. Just as before, the Ranch lists no\nspecific end use or buyer for the 54,000 afy of water it\nseeks. The second application is essentially the same\napplication as before,\nand therefore just \nas illegal as the first \napplication.\nStill, seemingly con-\nfident that its second\napplication will be \naccepted, the Ranch \nwithdrew its first \napplication and \ndropped its appeal \ntwo days before its \ncourt date.\n“The Ranch has \nobviously spent a lot of money and time weaving a\ncolorful story about what it might do with this water,”\nsays Frederick. “But no matter how elaborate its story,\nthe Ranch has not satisfied the first requirement for\nappropriating water: showing that it has any actual\npurpose or place of beneficial use for the water. \nOur clients and New Mexico’s taxpayers are being \npenalized by having to start the process over again \njust because the Ranch put a different shade of lipstick\non this pig.” \nWe’ll keep you apprised of the next steps that the Law\nCenter and its clients take to prevent this water grab. \n\nSpotlight\nT wenty-Seven Years of Environmental and Community Victories 76 ww w. nmelc.org\nDevelopment News Development NewsNew Mexico \nEnvironmental Law Center\nGreenBusinessPartner20 1 4\nThank you GreenBusinessP artners!\nFor more information about our Partner program, contact\nElizabeth Lee at 505.989.9022 x18, or elee@nmelc.org.\nArt detective, veteran appraiser, expert \nwitness for the FBI, world traveler, \nlecturer, blogger, TV host, professor, \npassionate conservationist, and long-\ntime Law Center supporter, Bernard         \nEwell is an interesting character indeed. \nNow he can add \n“published author” to \nhis long list of accom-\nplishments with the\nrecent publication of his nonfiction book entitled \nArtful Dodgers:\nFraud and Foolishness in the Art Market.\nBernard tells all in this tale of the international art market,\nhighlighting “the crooks and their victims” in what he calls “the\nmost unregulated market on earth”.

But this summer, Augustin\nPlains Ranch, LLC and the State Engineer tried to make the case \nevaporate. You’re making sure we can challenge them.\nOn September 22, 2014, Law Center Staff Attorney Bruce Frederick asked\nthe state Supreme Court to order the State Engineer to deny a second\nwater grab application filed by Augustin Plains Ranch, LLC. (His petition\nfor a writ of mandamus can be found at nmelc.org.)\nBackground: In August, the Ranch and the State Engineer backed out \nof the court appeal over the biggest private water grab attempt in New\nMexico history.

For the first time ever, the State\nis permitting an entire industry to \npollute New Mexico’s water resources.\nAs a Law Center member, you made\nit possible for the Law Center to\nbuild a damning record against the\nregulations during the rulemaking.\nNow you’re making it possible for us\nto challenge the Rule in the second\nhighest court in New Mexico. Staff\nAttorney Bruce Frederick is lead\ncounsel on the case, and filed the\nappeal in November.\nY our support built the record on which\nthat appeal is based. It shows:\n• State collusion with Freeport \nMcMoRan, the world’s largest publicly\ntraded copper mining company.\n• A shoddy defense of the Rule by the\nNew Mexico Environment Department\n(NMED). The agency did not present\neven one qualified technical staffer \nin support of the Rule.\n• Willful violation of the state’s Water \nQuality Act, which requires that \ngroundwater be protected from \npollution. For the first time ever, the\nState is permitting an entire industry\nto pollute New Mexico’s water resources.\nThe Copper Rule exempts water\nbeneath and around copper mines\nfrom water quality standards. It allows\nmining companies to forego pollution\nprevention measures and monitoring\nwithin these exempt areas. All mining\ncompanies have to do? Promise to\ncontain contaminated water. Forever. \n“For more than twenty years, New\nMexico has reaped the rewards of its\nMining Act, including cleaner water\nand meaningful mine reclamation,”\nsays Brian Shields, Executive Director\nof Amigos Bravos, a watershed pro-\ntection organization. “In one fell swoop,\nthe Copper Rule will reverse existing\nprotections for the water we drink\nand play in. And it opens the door \nfor other industries, like the dairy \nindustry, to seek similar permission\nto dump in our state's aquifers.”\n“Every New Mexican who cares about\nwater should thank a Law Center\nmember,” says Allyson Siwik, Executive\nDirector of the Gila Resources Information\nProject\n(GRIP), which is represented by\nthe Law Center. “You have made it\npossible for GRIP – and the public\ninterest – to have robust legal repre-\nsentation in one of the most critical\nlegal fights over water protection in\nNew Mexico’s history.

Top 3:\n1) Water quantity/quality \n2) Climate Change \n3) Oil and gas drilling/fracking \n“Water is the most critical resource in New Mexico. \nThe lack of competence in the state’s regulatory agencies\nis appalling and the influence and power of the State has\ncreated a crisis for the environment.”\nHow well do you think environmental regulations \nprotect your community’s health?\n“In this state it’s all about how regulations impact \neconomics – not about anyone’s health.”\nIn the next 5 years, what is your hope regarding \nenvironmental issues facing New Mexico? Top 3:\n1) The development of a plan for dealing with the growing \nwater shortage\n2) To see concrete moves to address the coming effects of \nclimate change\n3) To see a commitment from decision-makers to protection   \nfuture drinking water sources from pollution\nWhy do you give to local New Mexico non-profits? Top 3:\n1) I believe supporting local non-profits positively affects my \nlife and my loved ones. (57.3%)\n2) I believe that local grassroots organizations are more \neffective than national organizations. (44.2%)\n3) I volunteer and I give to the nonprofits for which I \nvolunteer. (39.3%)\nPlease rate how effective the Law Center is at protecting\nNew Mexico’s environment and communities.\n67% of you said we’re doing a great job, 19% said we’re doing\npretty well, and 14% of you said we could be doing better.\nHere’s a sampling of some of your comments:\nWe’ll work hard to do a better job of staying in touch\nabout what we’re working on, and we’ll continue to\nstrive to be our state’s best legal advocates for a healthy\nenvironment and for communities where we all want to\nlive. We appreciate the honest input from everyone \nwho helped with our survey!\nTwenty-Six Years of Environmental and Community Victories 5\nCase Updates\nA Faint Stench is Slowly Coming in...\nHundred of flies are around just about all year.  Relief from flies\nmay be about two months, may be.  These flies also do not stop\nat the dairies’ fences either.  They like doors that if you open\nthem, they zoom right in no matter how fast you open and close\nthe door.  My granddaughter and I have to run inside, or run \noutside, in tandem, trying to close the door as fast as possible so\nthe least possible amounts of flies enter my house!  Again I ask\nyou: how healthy can THIS be?\nLast March (2013), my granddaughter, a 3rd grader, was told\nabout a meteor that she could view around 6:00 p.m.  The stink/\nacrid stench coming from the dairy was so bad she and I could\nnot stand to be out there even for a minute!  We actually ran back\ninto the house because the stench was burning my nose.  \nNeedless to say , the stink came into the house since we opened\nand closed the door and the stink was so strong. And this is \ntypical of our lack of quality of life because of the dairy .  So \nneedless to say , we did not look for the meteor.  Again, I ask you:\nhow healthy can THIS be and in how many ways?\nI have not tried to sell my house, but I’m sure I would have a\nheck of time trying to sell it; especially when the wind blows\nacross from the dairy side and over to my property and the flies\nare at their best and most!\nWhere a number of these contamination, polluting and \nirresponsible operations, as is, are in poor communities where \ncitizens do not have the resources to defend their rights.\nBottom line on this legislation is the denial of citizens’ and \ncommunities’ rights to protection from these contamination, \npolluting, and irresponsible operations!  It’s about NUISANCES;\nif dairies were more responsible, maybe this conversation would\nnot even be happening....  \nThank you,\nMaria Elena Bejarano\n“The shift in administration in \nNew Mexico has allowed massive \ncorporate influence on decisions that \nhave a long-term impact on groundwater quality, \namong other environmental matters.\n” \n– Jonathan Block,Staff Attorney\n© CC \"Cows\" Ted Bigham, flickr\n\nTwenty-Six Years of Environmental and Community Victories 76 ww w. nmelc.org\nDevelopment News\nink well\nproductionstions oduc pr\nell ink w\nLILLEY LAW OFFICES\nLAS CRUCES\n RESOURCES\nFOR CHANGE, INC.\nJ8EK8\u0017=<\n>I<<E\u0017:?8D9<I\u0017F=\u0017:FDD<I:<\n\u0017GFN<I\u0017LG\u0017PFLI\u00179LJ@E<JJ\nKESHI\nthe zuni ĐŽŶŶĞĐƟŽŶ\nNew Mexico \nEnvironmental Law Center\nGreenBusinessPartner20 1 4Thank Y ou Green Business Partners!

For the first time ever, the State\nis permitting an entire industry to \npollute New Mexico’s water resources.\nAs a Law Center member, you made\nit possible for the Law Center to\nbuild a damning record against the\nregulations during the rulemaking.\nNow you’re making it possible for us\nto challenge the Rule in the second\nhighest court in New Mexico. Staff\nAttorney Bruce Frederick is lead\ncounsel on the case, and filed the\nappeal in November.\nY our support built the record on which\nthat appeal is based. It shows:\n• State collusion with Freeport \nMcMoRan, the world’s largest publicly\ntraded copper mining company.\n• A shoddy defense of the Rule by the\nNew Mexico Environment Department\n(NMED). The agency did not present\neven one qualified technical staffer \nin support of the Rule.\n• Willful violation of the state’s Water \nQuality Act, which requires that \ngroundwater be protected from \npollution. For the first time ever, the\nState is permitting an entire industry\nto pollute New Mexico’s water resources.\nThe Copper Rule exempts water\nbeneath and around copper mines\nfrom water quality standards. It allows\nmining companies to forego pollution\nprevention measures and monitoring\nwithin these exempt areas. All mining\ncompanies have to do? Promise to\ncontain contaminated water. Forever. \n“For more than twenty years, New\nMexico has reaped the rewards of its\nMining Act, including cleaner water\nand meaningful mine reclamation,”\nsays Brian Shields, Executive Director\nof Amigos Bravos, a watershed pro-\ntection organization. “In one fell swoop,\nthe Copper Rule will reverse existing\nprotections for the water we drink\nand play in. And it opens the door \nfor other industries, like the dairy \nindustry, to seek similar permission\nto dump in our state's aquifers.”\n“Every New Mexican who cares about\nwater should thank a Law Center\nmember,” says Allyson Siwik, Executive\nDirector of the Gila Resources Information\nProject\n(GRIP), which is represented by\nthe Law Center. “You have made it\npossible for GRIP – and the public\ninterest – to have robust legal repre-\nsentation in one of the most critical\nlegal fights over water protection in\nNew Mexico’s history.

In spite of these requirements, the Ranch\noffered no specific plans in its application for what it would do with 17.5 billion gallons\nper year. \nSince 2008, the Law Center has provided free representation to more than 80 families in\nCatron and Socorro Counties in this case. But the outcome of this case would be felt far\nbeyond Catron County: approval of the Ranch’s proposal would open the door to \nwide-scale water speculation throughout New Mexico.\nIn January , the Ranch appealed the decision. Y et in our arid state, the story is far from\nover even if the Ranch's appeal is unsuccessful. The Albuquerque Journalreports that\nD.L. Sanders, lead attorney for the State Engineer, has urged the Ranch to submit a\nnew application, stating, “W e’re in favor of promoting innovative ideas like this.”\nAs a supporter of the Law Center, you ensure that we can continue to fight speculation\nin water and promote equitable access and use of water for all of us who depend upon\nNew Mexico’s water. \nSecond MajorVictoryinWater Grab CaseMartinez Administration\nContinues Attacks \nCopper Rule Latest T arget\nIf you live near a dairy , a dry cleaner , or a gas\nstation (to name a few types of facilities that\npollute groundwater), what is happening\ntoday in the Copper Rule case may impact\nyour community tomorrow .\nThe Copper Rule was intended to help\nprotectwater beneath open-pit copper\nmines.

In spite of these requirements, the Ranch\noffered no specific plans in its application for what it would do with 17.5 billion gallons\nper year. \nSince 2008, the Law Center has provided free representation to more than 80 families in\nCatron and Socorro Counties in this case. But the outcome of this case would be felt far\nbeyond Catron County: approval of the Ranch’s proposal would open the door to \nwide-scale water speculation throughout New Mexico.\nIn January , the Ranch appealed the decision. Y et in our arid state, the story is far from\nover even if the Ranch's appeal is unsuccessful. The Albuquerque Journalreports that\nD.L. Sanders, lead attorney for the State Engineer, has urged the Ranch to submit a\nnew application, stating, “W e’re in favor of promoting innovative ideas like this.”\nAs a supporter of the Law Center, you ensure that we can continue to fight speculation\nin water and promote equitable access and use of water for all of us who depend upon\nNew Mexico’s water. \nSecond MajorVictoryinWater Grab CaseMartinez Administration\nContinues Attacks \nCopper Rule Latest T arget\nIf you live near a dairy , a dry cleaner , or a gas\nstation (to name a few types of facilities that\npollute groundwater), what is happening\ntoday in the Copper Rule case may impact\nyour community tomorrow .\nThe Copper Rule was intended to help\nprotectwater beneath open-pit copper\nmines. Over eight months in 2012, draft \nlanguage was hammered out by a working\ngroup comprised of regulators, representa-\ntives from the state’s copper companies \n(primarily Freeport McMoRan, the largest\npublicly-traded copper company in the\nworld) and advocates for the public\ninterest, including our own Staff Attorney\nBruce Frederick. The draft included \nconcessions to the\nmining industry\nbut also preserved\ncritical, hard-won \nprotections for\ngroundwater .\nThen the political\nappointees got\ntheir hands on it.\nIgnoring the recommendations of their\nown technical staff, upper-level managers\nat the New Mexico Environment\nDepartment (NMED) revamped the draft\nCopper Rule to reflect comments made by\nGreenFireReport winter 2013 issue Sponsor\n“\nThank you to the Santa Fe Green Chamber of\nCommerce, our newest Green Business Partner, for\nunderwriting this issue of the Green Fire Report.\nThe Green Business Partner program offers a platform\nfor the Law Center and sustainably minded businesses\nto support each other’s common values and goals. \nPlease support our Green Business Partners.\nSee page 4 for our complete roster .\nContact Information\nwww.nmelc.org\n505.989.9022 | nmelc@nmelc.org  \nFacebook.com/NMELC  \nTwitter.com/NMELC\n[ continued on pg 2]\nNew Mexico \nEnvironmental Law Center\nGreenBusinessP artner\n20 1 3\nNew Mex ico Environmental Law Center saved the following resources by  using 210 pounds of Reincarnation\nMatte, made with 60% post-consumer waste and manufactured with electricity  that is offset with Green-e®\ncertified renewable energy  certificates.trees water energy solid waste greenhouse\ngases\n1\nfully  grown\n589\ngallons\n0.6\nMillion BTUs\n39\npounds\n109\npounds\nThe Augustin Plains water grab is one of the cases \nhighlighted in our new short film, A Big Damn Deal.\nCheck it out at nmelc.org.\nNew Mexico \nEnvironmental Law Center\nGreenBusinessPartner\n20 1 3\nT o Join,contact the Chapter nearest you.\nSanta Fe\nP .O.

Our clients walked away from the\ncourthouse with a stunning victory– one\nthat sends the message to the Governor\n(once again) that her Administration is\nnot above the law. After the hearing we\nwere able to sit down with Law Center\nStaff Attorney Eric Jantz for a quick\ncatch-up on the case.\nCan you provide a little background\non the Mount T aylor Mine case? \nEric: The Mt.Taylor uranium mine \noperated intermittently in the 1970s and\n1980s. In 1992, it stopped production\nbecause the uranium market tanked.\nAfter the New Mexico Mining Act\npassed in 1993, the Mt. Taylor Mine\nobtained a mining permit, which it\n[ continued on pg 2]\nalmost immediately revised to allow it\nto go on “standby \nstatus”. In 2010, Rio\nGrande Resources applied for the mine’s\nfourth standby permit. Under the\nMartinez Administration, MMD and\nthe Commission took every opportunity\nto cut our clients out of the process.\nMASE and Amigos Bravos were not\nallowed to introduce important ecological\ntestimony at a public hearing, and were\ntold that it was outside the scope of the\npermit. They were barred from ques-\ntioning the company’s reclamation\nbond – in fact, MMD decided to review\nthe company’s bond afterit renewed the\npermit, and has yet to receive public\ninput. Finally, our clients were not able\nto review an economic viability analysis\nthat is supposed to provide evidence that\nthe uranium market\nwould be robust\nenough for the mine\nto reopen in 2014.\nAfter the agencies\nrenewed the stand-\nby permit, we took\nthem to court.\nWhat was the ruling?\nEric: Judge Raymond\nOrtiz of Santa Fe\nDistrict Court ruled\nthat the agencies\nfailed to provide\nopportunities for\neffective public \nparticipation in the\nMt. Taylor proceed-\ning. Because of this\nruling, MMD will\nhave to hold new\nhearings on environmental safeguards,\nfinancial assurance, and economic viability\nfor the Mt. Taylor Mine. It is an important\nruling for the people in our state.\nThe ruling affects a permit for a mine\nnear Grants. Why is the decision\nimportant for all New Mexicans? \nEric: Basically, the judge ruled that the\nprovisions of the New Mexico Mining\nTHANK YOU FOR BIG WIN!\nMembers make Mount T aylor victory possible\nEnjoying our Mt. T aylor uranium mine victory at the Steve Herrera Judicial Complex (from left):\nDouglas Meiklejohn (NMELC); Nadine Padilla (MASE); Laura Watchempino (Laguna-Acoma\nCitizens for a Safe Environment/MASE); Eric Jantz (NMELC Lead Counsel); Candace Head-Dylla\n(Bluewater V alley Downstream Alliance/MASE); Lisa Franceware (NMELC legal intern); and\nPetuuche Gilbert (Laguna-Acoma Citizens for a Safe Environment/MASE)\n\nCase Updates\n2 ww w. nmelc.org\nAct that provide for transparency, accountability, and public\nparticipation are meaningful. It is unacceptable for the\nagencies to interpret those provisions so narrowly as to \nrender them meaningless.\nThus the agency – and indeed, the Administration – is \non notice that it cannot treat the public as a nuisance to be\ntolerated. Under the Mining Act, it must take into account\nour questions, concerns and grievances. I imagine that this\nruling will impress upon other agencies like the New Mexico\nEnvironment Department that they should not try to\ndodge requirements for public participation.\nWhat’s next?\nEric: Rio Grande Resources filed an application earlier \nthis year to take the mine to “active” rather than “standby”\nstatus. We have requested a hearing on that permit applica-\ntion, and anticipate that will happen this fall. With Judge\nOrtiz’s ruling, we know that our clients will be afforded\nmuch better opportunities to participate in that process.\nAnything else to add? \nEric: We are up against some major players in this case.\nNot only are we opposed by the New Mexico Mining\nCommission and MMD, but the Mt. Taylor Mine is operated\nby Rio Grande Resources, which is a wholly-owned sub-\nsidiary of General Atomics (a global defense contractor). \nI would like to thank our supporters for making sure \nthat the Law Center was there when communities near Mt.\nTaylor needed legal representation. In a perfect world, we\ncould trust our government and corporations to do the right\nthing. In the real world, we rely on your help to make sure\nthat decision-makers are held accountable for their actions.\nThank you again, and we will keep you apprised of what\nhappens in this case and in others that affect Mt. Taylor.\n[ Mount T aylor Ruling, continued from page 1]\n Your investmentinthe Law Center           \n    \nSome issues our members are supporting this summer:\nWater Grabs:Stopping Italian billionaire Bruno Modena, who seeks \nto grab 54,000 acre-feet of water near Datil – enough to supply a city \nof 500,000 annually.\nUranium: Winning protections for residents who live near the\nHomestake uranium millsite.

Today, that work is more important\nthan ever: in the summer of 2013 Elephant Butte\nReservoir, New Mexico’s largest reservoir,\ndwindled to its lowest level in forty years,\nabout 3 percent of the reservoir’s capacity.\nNASA photo taken June 2, 1994\nNASA photo taken July 8, 2013 \nWater protection instead of water pollution\n\nCase Updates\nTwenty Five Years of Environmental and Community Victories3\nOil & Gas Pit Rule:    \nIn June, the Martinez Administration gutted the “Pit Rule,” which \ngoverns the storage and disposal of toxic oil and gas drilling\nwastes. The Oil Conservation Commission removed nearly\nall of its stringent provisions, including setbacks to\nhomes and wells and requirements for closed-loop \nsystems where pits are near water resources. It also\nadded a provision that allows for“frack lakes” – multi-\nwell, multi-acre pits that hold toxic drilling wastes.\nMember support ensured that Attorney Eric Jantz could\nbuild a strong case for appeal during the rulemaking, and\nthat he could file that appeal in district court in August 2013.\nHomestake Uranium Mill:     \nAttorney Jon Block represents members of the Bluewater \nValley Downstream Alliance, most of whom live in the \nshadow of the Homestake uranium mill Superfund site. \nA recent draft report by the Environmental Protection\nAgency shows that residents near the mill face a cancer \nrisk 18 times higher than that considered acceptable by \nthe EPA. Jon and his clients continue to advocate to EPA \nRegion 6 that the site be cleaned up.\nAquifer Science Water Appropriation \nIn this major water case, Aquifer Science, LLC seeks a 700 acre- \nfoot appropriation near Sandia Park. Although the State \nEngineer has stated that the basin has been over \nappropriated since the 1980s, it now appears to be \nendorsing the company’s application.

(The repealed Codes sought to\nreduce energy usage by new construction\nby 20%) The victory was short-lived: the\nCommission has held a new vote and issued\na Statement of Reasons for adopting weaker\nregulations. We filed a new appeal shortly\nafter the Commission held its new vote.\nBut it was another message to the\nMartinez Administration that it cannot\ncircumvent the law.\n“It is well established that agencies must\nprovide the reasoning for their decisions,\nbut the Commission’s only effort to do so\ncame after we filed our appeal,” says\nDoug Meiklejohn, Law Center Executive\nDirector and lead counsel on this case.\n“Once again a court has had to explain to\nthe Administration that the law applies \nto everyone.”\nDoug represents Southwest Energy\nEfficiency Project (SWEEP), Sundancer\nCreations, eSolved, Inc., Environment \nNew Mexico, and several individuals.\nThank you for \nhelping us win the \nfirst EnergyConservation\nCodes case!\n“Once again a court \nhad to explain to the \nAdministration that the \nlaw applies to everyone. ”  \n\n\n4 ww w. nmelc.org\nCase Updates\nHow you’re standing up to one of the\nworst proposed regulations (ever)\nNMED inexplicably fights on behalf of Big Copper for\nright to pollute public water\nAs an agency tasked with protecting water quality in our state, you would hope\nthat the New Mexico Environment Department would, well, work to protect\nwater quality. Here’s just one example of how it’s not: it is pushing for a “Copper\nRule” that would circumvent our state’s key water quality law and allow massive\ncontamination of groundwater.\nFortunately, as a Law Center member, you’re standing up to this travesty.\nYou’re supporting an epic legal battle in what is one of the most significant water\ncases in New Mexico history. \nHere are some of the provisions sought by NMED and copper giant Freeport\nMcMoRan: \n• Exempt every New Mexico copper mine (now and in the future) from the NM\nWater Quality Act.\n• Remove common sense pollution prevention measures, such as liners beneath\nacid-producing waste rock piles. (Liners help to intercept toxins before they can\nreach groundwater.)\n• Eliminate comprehensive monitoring and reporting requirements, so as to hobble\nthe ability of regulators and citizens to know where (and how much) pollution is\noccurring, and where it’s heading. Going up against a state agency and the largest\npublicly-traded copper company in the world, Law Center members ensured\nthat our public water had strong representation during the month-long hearing.\nWe await a decision on the Rule by the Water Quality Control Commission.\nStaff Attorney Bruce Frederick worked with co-counsel Tracy Hughes (High Desert\nEnergy + Environment Law Partners) to represent Amigos Bravos and the Gila\nResources Information Project – two of our state’s most experienced advocates when\nit comes to protecting water near hardrock mines. You can find out more about the\nseamy underbelly of this case in Laura Paskus’ “The Canary in the Copper Mine \n(is Dead): How New Mexico’s Copper Industry Wrote its own Rules,” an exposé \nin the Santa Fe Reporter dated May 14, 2013. \nIn a situation that has the potential to\nset national precedent, the New Mexico\nEnvironmental Law Center has signed\non to help Mora County uphold its ban\non oil and gas drilling in the event it is\nchallenged in court.\n\"This really is the most unadulterated\nform of democracy that there is,\" Eric\nJantz said of the county's ordinance.\n\"This is communities taking control and\nmaking decisions about their future.\"\nEric is working with the Community\nEnvironmental Legal Defense Fund in\nthis case.\nNMELC to represent\nMora County in any\nupcoming fight over\nfracking \n“I don’t think that I could possibly\noverstate the negative impacts these\nrules could have on the communities\nnear where I live.\n...I think these rules might allow the\nsame kind of pollution at new mines in\ndifferent communities that they have –\nthat these existing mines have already\ncreated, and that seems to me to be a\nshame because we should learn from\nour past mistakes.\nAlso, I think they set a very dangerous\nprecedent for other industries, as [former\nNM Groundwater Bureau Chief Bill]\nOlson has been very clear about. I think\nof water as a lifeblood of our state.\nI think it's precious. I think we should\nprotect it. I think the integrity of this\nWater Quality Commission and the\nEnvironment Department are at stake if\nyou actually approve these regulations\nas written. I truly believe that.”\n– Sally Smith, Grant County resident, Gila\nResources Information Project Board Member,\nand long-time Law Center client.

There were about 100 of us in the\nSocorro County courthouse on February 7 – a smattering of reporters and me sprinkled in\na crowd that mostly hailed from Catron County , where an Italian billionaire seeks to claim\nmore than 17 billion gallons of water annually .  In what seemed like an oddly short hearing\n– just over an hour– the\ndozen or so attorneysin\nthe room argued the\npoints of law in one of\nthe most important\nwater battles in recent\nmemory .\n“In essence, Augustin\nPlains Ranch simply\nwrote a very large\nnumber [of acre-feet] on \na piece of paper and\nlisted every potential need\nfor water that might arise sometime in the future within a vast area of the state, ”explained\nLaw Center attorney Bruce Frederick, who represents most of the people in the gallery .\nShortly before her election, Susana Martinez promised that “As governor, I would absolutely\nremove the Pit Rule as a regulation.” Her promise took a stumble in February , after District\nCourt Judge Raymond Ortiz granted us a rare “writ of prohibition” in the case.\nIndustry appealed the Pit Rule in state District Court in July 2008; that case is ongoing.\nLeery of an uncertain outcome, the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association (NMOGA) took a\nnew tack late last year in its efforts to sink the Rule. Put this case on hold, its attorneys asked\nDistrict Court Judge Barbara Vigil, and the Oil Conservation Commission will adopt our\nnew proposed Pit Rule. Then the Court won’t have to worry about this case anymore.  \nJudge Vigil ordered a stay of the appeal in January 2012.   \nOn the same day as Judge Vigil handed down her decision, NMELC attorney \nEric Jantz filed a petition for the writ. “One of the basic tenets of our \ndemocratic system is the separation of powers,” explains Eric.“Once a \nregulation has been appealed, the executive branch is done making decisions \nin the case. At that point, it’s up to the courts to decide what happens.” \nA month later, Judge Ortiz issued the writ of prohibition.\nAttorney Bruce Frederick discusses case with Carol & Ray Pittman\n© photo courtesy of Debra Anderson\nStories\ncontinued on pg 2 >\nThe perfect, easy, yummy gift for the activist in your life.\nJustice has never tasted so sweet!\nby Shelbie Knox\nPhoto: courtesy, State of New Mexico)\n© photo courtesy of Juana Colón\n\n\nCase Updates\nTwenty Five Years of Environmental and Community Victories    3\nCase Updates\n2     ww w. nmelc.org\n“It took me more than two hours to drive\ndown from Santa Fe, and I never left the\narea of use proposed by the Ranch.”\nThe hearing centered on Motions to \nDismiss the Ranch’s water rights \napplication.

Instead, under the\nMartinez Administration, witnesses\nwere given two minutes, then they were\ncut off.  The meetings in Albuquerque,\nFarmington, Las Cruces and Roswell\nwere all held on the same night. There\nwere no commissioners at any of those\nmeetings.” \nThe CIC repealed and amended the\ncodes a week after those four statewide\nmeetings. “There was no discussion, no\npros and cons–just a vote,” Fiebelkorn\nadded. “There was supposed to be\nanalysis, expert witnesses.” The com-\nmission was so blatant in its contempt\nfor the law, it issued a press release\nannouncing its decisions before the\nmeeting was over, even though the votes\nto amend the codes took place at the\nend of the meeting.  \nwith the builders, and they provided\nthe cost of those measures.

Fiebelkorn\nestimates an increase of $750 on an\naverage home and perhaps $2,000 for \na very large house. For commercial\nbuildings the added expense was\napproximately one half of one percent.\n“We have to change our mindset\nbecause the cost of energy is going to\nincrease over time,” said client Faren\nDancer, a Santa Fe green builder and\nhost of Green Talk Radio. “Why create\nmore buildings that are going to be \ntoo expensive to maintain, more \nbuildings that will need to be \nretrofitted in a few years?”\nSanta Fe’s building codes prove\nDancer’s point.

There were about 100 of us in the\nSocorro County courthouse on February 7 – a smattering of reporters and me sprinkled in\na crowd that mostly hailed from Catron County , where an Italian billionaire seeks to claim\nmore than 17 billion gallons of water annually .  In what seemed like an oddly short hearing\n– just over an hour– the\ndozen or so attorneysin\nthe room argued the\npoints of law in one of\nthe most important\nwater battles in recent\nmemory .\n“In essence, Augustin\nPlains Ranch simply\nwrote a very large\nnumber [of acre-feet] on \na piece of paper and\nlisted every potential need\nfor water that might arise sometime in the future within a vast area of the state, ”explained\nLaw Center attorney Bruce Frederick, who represents most of the people in the gallery .\nShortly before her election, Susana Martinez promised that “As governor, I would absolutely\nremove the Pit Rule as a regulation.” Her promise took a stumble in February , after District\nCourt Judge Raymond Ortiz granted us a rare “writ of prohibition” in the case.\nIndustry appealed the Pit Rule in state District Court in July 2008; that case is ongoing.\nLeery of an uncertain outcome, the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association (NMOGA) took a\nnew tack late last year in its efforts to sink the Rule. Put this case on hold, its attorneys asked\nDistrict Court Judge Barbara Vigil, and the Oil Conservation Commission will adopt our\nnew proposed Pit Rule. Then the Court won’t have to worry about this case anymore.  \nJudge Vigil ordered a stay of the appeal in January 2012.   \nOn the same day as Judge Vigil handed down her decision, NMELC attorney \nEric Jantz filed a petition for the writ. “One of the basic tenets of our \ndemocratic system is the separation of powers,” explains Eric.“Once a \nregulation has been appealed, the executive branch is done making decisions \nin the case. At that point, it’s up to the courts to decide what happens.” \nA month later, Judge Ortiz issued the writ of prohibition.\nAttorney Bruce Frederick discusses case with Carol & Ray Pittman\n© photo courtesy of Debra Anderson\nStories\ncontinued on pg 2 >\nThe perfect, easy, yummy gift for the activist in your life.\nJustice has never tasted so sweet!\nby Shelbie Knox\nPhoto: courtesy, State of New Mexico)\n© photo courtesy of Juana Colón", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "f88c28558d484787d1c7c013c1918baa363bfcd0530e8657616c6840f7606ece", "out_path": "raw/pdf/https_nmelc.org_wp-content_uploads_2017_03_GFR_2012_spring.pdf.pdf", "notes": null, "tags": ["pdf"]}

Earlier\nthis year, Helena\nappealed its air quality\npermit to appellate\ncourt; we attempted \nto intervene, but were\ndenied. Because the\ngroup was not an \nofficial party to the \nproceeding, the\nSupreme Court did \nnot require the \nappellate court to\ngrant us party status.\n“This could be a \ndifficult ruling for\ncommunities,” says \nLaw Center attorney\nJon Block. “Concerned \nresidents will have to\nget involved in an official capacity at the\nbeginning of a proceeding,or they may\nlose their rights to participate later. It’s \na tough thing to ask of New Mexicans who\ndon’thave expertise in how the system\nworks and lack the funds for the lawyers\nand experts needed to challenge \nagency permitting decisions.” \nFor more information on our \ngreenhouse gas case, see page 2.\nAlso see nmelc.org for updates \nand background information.\nIn July, the Law Center and its members\nscored their third victory of the year at the\nstate Supreme Court. In a unanimous \ndecision, the justices ruled that parties which\nparticipate in rulemakings can, by right, \nparticipate in appeals.\nThe case sprang\nfrom an appeal filed\nby PNM and our\nstate’s other major \ncarbon polluters to\nget “Rule 100” over-\nturned. Rule 100 is\nthe carbon cap that\nwe and our client,\nNew Energy Economy,\nwon in 2010, after \ntwo years of work. \nThe Supreme\nCourt’sdecision over-\nturned a May ruling\nby the Court of\nAppeals to keep New\nEnergy Economy and\nseveral other public\ninterest groups out of \nPNM’s appeal. We are now parties in that case.\n“This is an important victory,” said attorney\nBruce Frederick. “If the Court of Appeals’s\nopinion were allowed to stand, public-interest\ngroups would be barred from defending on\nappeal the same regulations that they drafted\nand persuaded an agency to adopt. Then\nthere would be little point in advocating for\ngood regulations in the first place.”\nRuling A Double-Edged Sword\nWhile the ruling is a victory for New\nEnergy Economy and others, it also can be a\nTOP: Attorney Bruce Frederick talks with\nAmigos Bravos’attorneys during a break; NMELC\nAttorneys Bruce Frederick (left) and Jon Block (center)\nwith Erik Schlenker-Goodrich of the Western\nEnvironmental Law Center wait for the decisions.\n© photo courtesy of John DeBord\n© photo courtesy of Shelbie Knox\n \n\nCase Updates\nTwenty Four Years of Environmental and Community Victories    3\nCase Updates\n2 w w w.nmelc.org\nLaw Center asks judge to stop illegal tactics by State \nSurrendered documents show NMED manager catered to mining company\nA new lawsuit aims to stop the New Mexico \nEnvironment Department (NMED) and Hydro \nResources, Inc. from illegally expediting \nuranium mining in the Navajo community \nof Church Rock.\nThe lawsuit asks a District Court judge to \ndetermine that the agency has no authority to \nconsider the company’s groundwater discharge \npermit as valid. The permit, which was issued \nin 1996, expired in 2003; we  assert the company \nneeds to undertake a new permitting process.\nThe suit also asks the judge to rule that \nNMED cannot allow Hydro Resources to\ndischarge into ground-water unless the agency\nissues a new, valid permit.

For six\ndays, we visited clients, asking them to \ntalk about their experiences with the \nNew Mexico Environmental Law Center.\nThis film will share their stories, and share\nthe impact that the Law Center and its\nmembers have had on communities\nthroughout the state.\nFirst Stop, Church Rock\nIn Church Rock, we met with Larry \nJ. King. He lives on his family's ranch, \nsurrounded by red rock cliffs and rolling\ngrass hills. A former uranium miner, he is\nnow on the board of Eastern Navajo Diné\nAgainst Uranium Mining (ENDAUM),\nworking to prevent new uranium mining\nin his community.\nAs Debra filmed him, he pointed to one\nproposed minesite, a stone’s throw from\nhis front door.\nI asked Larry to tell us how the Law\nCenter has helped their 17-year long fight.\nHe said that if it wasn't for the Law Center,\nhe was sure there would have been \nuranium mining happening across the\nroad from his home years ago.\nNext Stop, Crownpoint\nWe met with Christine Smith, who is\nalso a member of ENDAUM and lives in\nCrownpoint. There, she raised her family;\nsings in her church next door and can look\nout the back window of her home to see a\nproposed uranium mill site. \nShe talked about learning the risks of\nuranium mining and gaining confidence so\nthat she could educate her community. And\nshe said without the help of the Law Center,\nshe has no doubt the uranium would’ve\nbeen in her backyard a long time ago.\nOnward to Pie T own\nWe left Navajo Country and drove south\non N.M. 602 through lush green valleys\ntowards Pie Town, where we met clients\nwho are challenging a 17 billion gallon-\nper-year water grab (with a quick break \nfor pie, of course!)   \nOur clients, mostly ranchers and farmers,\nexpressed their gratitude at having a\nlawyer to confer with. San Augustin\nCoalition Treasurer Eileen Dodds said the\nLaw Center’s assistance was essential in\nhelping the community join together in\nunified opposition to an attempt by an\nItalian billionaire to take the region’s water.\nReflections at Home\nWhat struck me during these interviews\nwas how the Law Center amplified the\nstrength of our clients. They spoke of the\nfear, anger and frustration that occurred\nwhen they first heard of the threat coming\nto their home.  Then they spoke of how the\nLaw Center provided them with tools to\nface the threat – when no one else would.\nSee a preview of the film at nmelc.org/christine.\nby Juana Colónby Elizabeth Cook-Romero\ndesecration of the sacred mountain and\nto establish a process that will protect\nthe environment and the health of\nfuture generations. The Coalition\nbrings together citizens of Acoma\nPueblo, Laguna Pueblos and the Navajo\nNation, as well as Anglo groups of former\nuranium miners and local residents who\nhave been impacted by Cold War-era\nuranium contamination.  \nMASE and the Law Center are currently\nawaiting the issuance of a Draft Environ-\nmental Impact Statement by the U.S.\nForest Service, which manages a portion\nof land where the mine is proposed.The\nnext step will entail proceedings for\nstate-level permits. Because this is the\nfirst mining permit application for \nuranium since the passage of the New\nMexico Mining Act in 1993, it will set\nthe standards for all future conventional\nuranium mining permits.  \n“For whatever reason, the mining\ncompany and the regulators are going\nthrough the process too quickly,” said\nNadine Padilla, MASE’s Coordinator.\n“It’s not a well defined process. They’re\njust making it up as they go. I think it\nneeds to be slowed down so the public\nis offered more opportunities to be heard.”\nMount Taylor: sacred mountain under siege \nUranium companies versus native peoples in fight for holy place\nOn published atlases of New Mexico,\nthe stratovolcano that forms the highest\npeak of the San Mateo range is called\nMt. Taylor. But, the mountain has other,\nmore ancient names. The people of Acoma\nand some members of the Laguna\nPueblo call it Kaweshtima. Other Laguna\npeople call it Tsibina. In the Zuni Pueblo\nit is Dewankwin Kyaba:chu Yalanne.\nThe Navajo know it as Tsoodzíl. Among\nthe Hopi, it is Tsiipiya.\nEach of these tribes has a unique \ncreation narratives, and Mt. Taylor \nfigures prominently in all.

For six\ndays, we visited clients, asking them to \ntalk about their experiences with the \nNew Mexico Environmental Law Center.\nThis film will share their stories, and share\nthe impact that the Law Center and its\nmembers have had on communities\nthroughout the state.\nFirst Stop, Church Rock\nIn Church Rock, we met with Larry \nJ. King. He lives on his family's ranch, \nsurrounded by red rock cliffs and rolling\ngrass hills. A former uranium miner, he is\nnow on the board of Eastern Navajo Diné\nAgainst Uranium Mining (ENDAUM),\nworking to prevent new uranium mining\nin his community.\nAs Debra filmed him, he pointed to one\nproposed minesite, a stone’s throw from\nhis front door.\nI asked Larry to tell us how the Law\nCenter has helped their 17-year long fight.\nHe said that if it wasn't for the Law Center,\nhe was sure there would have been \nuranium mining happening across the\nroad from his home years ago.\nNext Stop, Crownpoint\nWe met with Christine Smith, who is\nalso a member of ENDAUM and lives in\nCrownpoint. There, she raised her family;\nsings in her church next door and can look\nout the back window of her home to see a\nproposed uranium mill site. \nShe talked about learning the risks of\nuranium mining and gaining confidence so\nthat she could educate her community. And\nshe said without the help of the Law Center,\nshe has no doubt the uranium would’ve\nbeen in her backyard a long time ago.\nOnward to Pie T own\nWe left Navajo Country and drove south\non N.M. 602 through lush green valleys\ntowards Pie Town, where we met clients\nwho are challenging a 17 billion gallon-\nper-year water grab (with a quick break \nfor pie, of course!)   \nOur clients, mostly ranchers and farmers,\nexpressed their gratitude at having a\nlawyer to confer with. San Augustin\nCoalition Treasurer Eileen Dodds said the\nLaw Center’s assistance was essential in\nhelping the community join together in\nunified opposition to an attempt by an\nItalian billionaire to take the region’s water.\nReflections at Home\nWhat struck me during these interviews\nwas how the Law Center amplified the\nstrength of our clients. They spoke of the\nfear, anger and frustration that occurred\nwhen they first heard of the threat coming\nto their home.  Then they spoke of how the\nLaw Center provided them with tools to\nface the threat – when no one else would.\nSee a preview of the film at nmelc.org/christine.\nby Juana Colónby Elizabeth Cook-Romero\ndesecration of the sacred mountain and\nto establish a process that will protect\nthe environment and the health of\nfuture generations. The Coalition\nbrings together citizens of Acoma\nPueblo, Laguna Pueblos and the Navajo\nNation, as well as Anglo groups of former\nuranium miners and local residents who\nhave been impacted by Cold War-era\nuranium contamination.  \nMASE and the Law Center are currently\nawaiting the issuance of a Draft Environ-\nmental Impact Statement by the U.S.\nForest Service, which manages a portion\nof land where the mine is proposed.The\nnext step will entail proceedings for\nstate-level permits. Because this is the\nfirst mining permit application for \nuranium since the passage of the New\nMexico Mining Act in 1993, it will set\nthe standards for all future conventional\nuranium mining permits.  \n“For whatever reason, the mining\ncompany and the regulators are going\nthrough the process too quickly,” said\nNadine Padilla, MASE’s Coordinator.\n“It’s not a well defined process. They’re\njust making it up as they go. I think it\nneeds to be slowed down so the public\nis offered more opportunities to be heard.”\nMount Taylor: sacred mountain under siege \nUranium companies versus native peoples in fight for holy place\nOn published atlases of New Mexico,\nthe stratovolcano that forms the highest\npeak of the San Mateo range is called\nMt. Taylor. But, the mountain has other,\nmore ancient names. The people of Acoma\nand some members of the Laguna\nPueblo call it Kaweshtima. Other Laguna\npeople call it Tsibina. In the Zuni Pueblo\nit is Dewankwin Kyaba:chu Yalanne.\nThe Navajo know it as Tsoodzíl. Among\nthe Hopi, it is Tsiipiya.\nEach of these tribes has a unique \ncreation narratives, and Mt. Taylor \nfigures prominently in all. For the region’s\ntribes, the mountain is a breathing \nentity, embodying a spiritual essence.\nIt is home to immortal beings and a\nplace of pilgrimage and prayer.

Chief Justice\nDaniels asked “... affected by the\nair?” “Yes, if you can show...”said\nKennedy.“...That they breathe? ”\nreplied Chief Justice Daniels.  \nAt which point the entire\naudience laughed. \nThe Justices then moved on to\nKennedy’s other argument. The Chief Justice\nquestioned Kennedy on what authority the\nGovernor had to halt the printing, asking:\n“Wouldn’t you agree that no person is above\nthe rule of law?” Justice Chavez added, “I\ndon’t see how the Governor has the\nauthority to trump the law. Then the\nGovernor can trump\nany law.”\nAfter a recess of only thirty minutes, the\nCourt returned, and Chief Justice Daniels \nstated that the Court would issue a writ\nagainst the State \nRecords Administrator, \ncompelling her to printthe rules. Chief Justice\nDaniels also said the Records Administrator\nhas a non-discretionary duty to follow the\nlaw to publish the rules and “let the validity\nof those regulations be tested” through\nestablished means.\nShortly before this case was \nheard by the Supreme Court, \nindustry groups appealed both\nregulations to the State Court of  \nAppeals. We will participate in \nthe cases this year.\nThe New Mexico\nEnvironmental\nLaw Center scored\na substantial win in\nthe state's Supreme\nCourt on January\n26th, when the\nJustices unani-\nmously granted a\nwrit of\nmandamus\nordering the\nState Records\nAdministratorto\nprint two new rules\nadopted by state\nagencies.\nThe Law Center petitioned the Court for\nthe writ on behalf of its clients,Amigos\nBravos and New Energy Economy.

The movement’s pundits and\npoliticians added the prefix“job killing” to\nevery mention of regulations.  Susana Martinez\nsignaled her alliance with that movement by\nmaking the “job-killing” tag a prominent\nfeature of her campaign for governor.  \nThe week before Gov. Martinez failed in\nher attempt to halt the publication of the\ndairy groundwater regulations (See page 1),\nthe dairy industry appealed the regulations\nto the state Court of Appeals. The Law Center\nwill be in Court defending the regulations\non behalf of its clients, known collectivelyas\nthe “Citizens’ Coalition”: Amigos Bravos,\nCaballo Concerned Citizens, the Rio Grande\nChapter of the Sierra Club, and Food and\nWater Watch. \nNew Mexico’s first concentrated animal\nfeeding operation (a dairy with more than\n700 cows) opened in the mid 1980s. Today,\non average, NM dairies house more than\n2,000 cows per operation – the highest\nLaw Center client Jerry Nivens, of Sierra County, was one of the first to start \nNew Mexico’scitizens’ dairy movement rolling. It was in 2007, after he heard \nrumors that a 2,000-head-dairy operation was to open near his home. He spent his \nbirthday driving around looking for a public posting and found a notice from the \nproposed ParaSol Dairy alongside a seldom-used road. The only newspaper notice \nhad appeared in the Hatch Citizen. “Hatch is 20 miles to the south,” Nivens said.\n“By no stretch of the imagination did that meet the requirements of the law to \ninform the public. Hatch isn’t even in Sierra County.”\nNivens circulated a petition and organized the Caballo Concerned Citizens \nGroup. By the time ParaSol ran a notice in the Sierra County \nSentinel, Nivens had \ngathered hundreds of signatures. Farmers downstream feared their crops could be \ncontaminated by E.coli, and those in the tourism industry worried about smells. Even the federal Bureau of Reclamation\nopposed the permit because the proposed site was in “an extremely sensitive location, basically on top of [Caballo] \nreservoir.” Despite concerted public protest and the denial of the permit twice by NMED Secretary Ron Curry, the permit\nwas granted– although with numerous environmental conditions – by the Water Quality Control Commission in June 2010. \nThe permit and the Governor aren’t stopping Jerry Nevins, however. “Our health and our property are in danger,” \nhe said. “When I was a boy, I saw this happen in Texas when the big feed lots came in.” If Nevins has anything to say\nabout it, that history isn’t going to repeat itself in New Mexico.\naverage number of animals per farm in the\nU.S.  One cow can produce as much waste\nas twenty people, so living near a factory\ndairy is like living near a small city that has\nno sewers or waste-treatment plant, just giant\nevaporative lagoons that might be lined\nwith only manure or clay. Approximately\n57 percent of the state’s dairies have polluted\nthe groundwater beneath their facilities,\naccording to the state’s Environment\nDepartment’s scientific data.  \nAfter a permit application for the proposed\nParaSol Dairy in Sierra County was denied\nin 2008(see below),the dairy industry \nsuccessfully lobbied for regulations with the\ngoal of making permitting more predictable.\nBy early 2010, the New Mexico Environment\nDepartment (NMED) developed draft \nregulations with input from dairy farmers,\nthe public and the Citizens’ Coalition \n(represented by Law Center attorneys Jon\nBlock and Bruce Frederick).  After four\nweeks of technical hearings, the regulations\nwere adopted by the Water Quality Control\nCommission in December 2010.\nThough the regulations do not incorporate\nAdministration working publicly and in secret to undermine protections\nGovernor Susana Martinez wasted no time trying to gut the regulations that protect \nNew Mexico’s natural resources and public health. And the Law Center wasted no time \nblocking her.  Some of her anti-environmental, anti-community efforts over the past three\nmonths include:\n1)  OFF TO A ROCKY START. Governor-elect Martinez sent the message to New Mexicans who care\nabout our environment that we’re in for a tough four years when she appointed an environmental \ntransition team consisting of representatives of the oil & gas industry, the dairy industry, the energy\nindustry, Los Alamos National Lab, and the ranching industry.  Soon afterward, she accepted nearly\n$300,000 in corporate contributions for her inauguration from power companies, oil & gas \ncompanies, and Helena Chemical.\n2)  HER FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER. Just minutes after being sworn in, Governor Martinez signed \nher first Executive Order (2011-001), which orders government agencies to identify “job-killing” \nregulations that can be modified or rescinded in order to assist “small” businesses. \n3)  REGULATIONS? WHAT REGULATIONS? On January 3, a lobbyist for \nthe dairy industry emailed the Governor’s office, asserting his view that the \nfirst Executive Order gave the Governor power to stop the printing of dairy \ngroundwater regulations adopted in 2010. He then helpfully included the phone\nnumber for the State Records Center. Two days later, the publication of the dairy regulations, \ngreenhouse gas emission limits, and 30 other regulations were halted. (See page 1, on the Law Center’s successful\nlawsuit in the New Mexico Supreme Court to overturn this decision.)\n4)  TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD…AS LONG AS IT CAN BE DONE IN SECRET. On her website, Governor\nMartinez states, “As public servants, we are accountable to New Mexicans and they should know exactly what their\ngovernment is doing on their behalf.” Yet her “Small Business-Friendly Task Force” met secretly for the first two months…and may have\ncontinued its undercover operations except for the dogged reporting of blogger Tracy Dingmann of ClearlyNewMexico.com.\n5)  BUT WAIT…THERE’S MORE.Dingmann uncovered the fact that there are not too many “small business” people on the \nSmall Business-Friendly Task Force. Instead, lobbyists for, and representatives of, some of New Mexico’s biggest industries \n(and biggest polluters) fill many of the seats at the meetings.\n6)  DIABOLICAL PLANS ARE AFOOT. According to the Task Force’s Mid-Point Report \n(found at our website, nmelc.org), the “goal [of the Task Force] is to provide the Governor \nand/or agencies cover when repealing or revising a rule or regulation thus avoiding litigation \nif possible… Each troublesome regulation will be accompanied by a recommendation on the best \nway to reduce their negative impacts.” Objectives outlined in the report include weakening the \nOil and Gas Pit Rule, climate change regulations, and “mitigating” mid-level classified \nState employees who have an “anti-business political agenda.” \n7)  \n“ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE COMMUNISTS.”Governor Martinez’s first nominee \nfor Secretary of The Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, Harrison Schmitt, \nequated environmentalists with communists. Although Dr. Schmitt withdrew before he was \nappointed, we anticipate that Governor Martinez will continue to champion decision-makers who \ndefer to industry over the environment and the health of our state’s residents.\n8)  \nNEVER SAY DIE [TO A PERMIT APPLICANT ].In 2010, the Camino Real Landfill in Sunland Park filed for a 10 year permit renewal.\nRepresenting local residents, the Law Center petitioned the Environment Department to reconsider the application after significant facts \nin the case changed. Less than two weeks after NMED Secretary-designate F. David Miller took office, however, he granted the permit. \nWe anticipate that this will be the first of many permit decisions that will benefit industry at the expense of vulnerable communities;\nthe Law Center will continue to work on behalf of these communities.\nall of the Coalition’s proposals, they contain\nmany safeguards including synthetic lagoon\nliners, specific requirements for separating\nmanure solids from wastewater discharges,\nmetering the flow of wastewater, collecting\ngroundwater samples and analyzing and\nreporting the results. \nCoalition activists are not surprised that\nGov. Martinez, whose campaign accepted\nmore than $80,000 from the dairy industry\n(according to FollowTheMoney.org), tried \nto block the regulations.  The revelation that\nher Small Business-Friendly Task Force is\npacked with big business representatives,\nincluding a lobbyist for the dairy industry,\ndid not shock them either.\nDespite the opposition, client Brian Shields,\nExecutive Director of Amigos Bravos, is\nconfident that the regulations will be\nupheld in court. “Even though the dairy\nindustry is working behind the scenes, we\nare confident we have what we need,” \nhe said. “Science is on our side.

In\nfact, he showed 100 photos of torn or other-\nwise improperly installed liners,” stated\nAttorney Eric Jantz in District Court on\nFebruary 23. “Nine months later, when it\nraised the chloride standard by 1100%, the\nOil Conservation Commission acted as if \nall of the sudden, oil and gas operators are\ninstalling liners correctly.”  \nSpeaking to Judge Barbara Vigil, Jantz\nexplained that compelling evidence such as\nliner testimony led the Commission to adopt\nthe stringent Pit Rule standards in the first\nplace. When it weakened the standard less\nthan a year later, the Commission’s change\nof heart was not based on compelling\nevidence, but on a backroom deal between\nGovernor Bill Richardson and the oil and\ngas industry. As such, it is a flawed standard\nthat should be revisited or rescinded.\nBut audience members left disappointed\nif they were hoping for rulings on either the\nchloride case, or the “Bolling” case, which\nis an industry appeal of the Pit Rule.\nOn behalf of Concerned Citizens for Nuclear\nSafety (CCNS), NMELC Staff Attorney Jon Block\nfiled a motion to intervene in the on-going Federal District Court case between the\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) and the New Mexico Secretary of the Environment over the\nLos Alamos National Laboratory hazardous waste permit. \nCCNS is concerned that (1) the permit as issued does not address the need for closure \nand post-closure plans on three major areas that need remediation from years of hazardous\nradioactive, chemical and mixed waste disposal; (2) the permit does not require ground\nwater monitoring for those areas; and (3) the permit does not eliminate continued open \nburning of hazardous waste as a disposal method. The DOE filed the suit charging that\nNMED was trying to regulate radioactive materials under the permit, but also challenging\nother portions of the permit in the same complaint. \nAt this point, CCNS' motion to intervene in the matter is pending. \nThe Law Center filed a motion on\nFebruary 11th to dismiss an application by\na corporation to appropriate 54,000 acre\nfeet of groundwater per year – enough\nwater to support a new city of hundreds of\nthousands of people. In its application,\nAugustin Plains Ranch, LLC, seeks \npermission from the New Mexico State\nEngineer to drill 37 wells, 3,000 feet deep,\non its corporate ranch located near Datil,\nNM, for the purpose of selling or using the\nwater anywhere within several counties. \n“The application has to be thrown out,\nbecause it is so vague and speculative that\nthe State Engineer can’t evaluate or\napprove it,” said Bruce Frederick, the Law\nCenter attorney who filed the motion on\nbehalf of about 80 residents who live in\nwest-central New Mexico. “Under our law,”\nstated Frederick, “no corporation or any\nother person can monopolize or hoard an\nentire supply of free public water for the\npurpose of speculative future sales. It’s\nunconstitutional and flies in the face of\nover 150 years of western water law, \nwhich is based on beneficial use.”\nIn addition to several tribes and pueblos\nthat signed on to the Law Center motion,\nthe Law Center has some interesting \nbedfellows in this case, including the \nfederal Bureau of Reclamation and the\nMiddle Rio Grande Conservancy District.\nThe hearing examiner assigned to the case\nwill hear oral arguments beginning on May\n20th.

At the\nconclusion of the chloride standard hearing,\nthe judge announced that she would send\nthe Bolling case directly to the state Court\nof Appeals without making a ruling.\nThe timing of these cases will depend\nupon a decision by Judge Vigil as to whether\nor not the chloride standard is remanded\nback to the Oil Conservation Commission.\nIf the standard is sent back to the agency ,\nthe Court will place a stay on the industry\nappeal until the Commission holds a new\nproceeding on the chloride standard, or reverts\nto the original standard.  If the standard is\nnot remanded, Judge Vigil will immediately\ncertify both cases to the Court of Appeals.\nTwenty Four Years of Environmental and Community Victories    5\nCase Updates\n4 w w w.nmelc.org\nPit Rule will go to higher Court\nLaw Center still working to reverse politically-\ncharged chloride standard rollback\n“At the original Pit Rule hearing, an Oil\nConservation Division staffer explained\nhow pit liners are installed incorrectly. In\nfact, he showed 100 photos of torn or other-\nwise improperly installed liners,” stated\nAttorney Eric Jantz in District Court on\nFebruary 23. “Nine months later, when it\nraised the chloride standard by 1100%, the\nOil Conservation Commission acted as if \nall of the sudden, oil and gas operators are\ninstalling liners correctly.”  \nSpeaking to Judge Barbara Vigil, Jantz\nexplained that compelling evidence such as\nliner testimony led the Commission to adopt\nthe stringent Pit Rule standards in the first\nplace. When it weakened the standard less\nthan a year later, the Commission’s change\nof heart was not based on compelling\nevidence, but on a backroom deal between\nGovernor Bill Richardson and the oil and\ngas industry. As such, it is a flawed standard\nthat should be revisited or rescinded.\nBut audience members left disappointed\nif they were hoping for rulings on either the\nchloride case, or the “Bolling” case, which\nis an industry appeal of the Pit Rule.\nOn behalf of Concerned Citizens for Nuclear\nSafety (CCNS), NMELC Staff Attorney Jon Block\nfiled a motion to intervene in the on-going Federal District Court case between the\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) and the New Mexico Secretary of the Environment over the\nLos Alamos National Laboratory hazardous waste permit. \nCCNS is concerned that (1) the permit as issued does not address the need for closure \nand post-closure plans on three major areas that need remediation from years of hazardous\nradioactive, chemical and mixed waste disposal; (2) the permit does not require ground\nwater monitoring for those areas; and (3) the permit does not eliminate continued open \nburning of hazardous waste as a disposal method. The DOE filed the suit charging that\nNMED was trying to regulate radioactive materials under the permit, but also challenging\nother portions of the permit in the same complaint. \nAt this point, CCNS' motion to intervene in the matter is pending. \nThe Law Center filed a motion on\nFebruary 11th to dismiss an application by\na corporation to appropriate 54,000 acre\nfeet of groundwater per year – enough\nwater to support a new city of hundreds of\nthousands of people. In its application,\nAugustin Plains Ranch, LLC, seeks \npermission from the New Mexico State\nEngineer to drill 37 wells, 3,000 feet deep,\non its corporate ranch located near Datil,\nNM, for the purpose of selling or using the\nwater anywhere within several counties. \n“The application has to be thrown out,\nbecause it is so vague and speculative that\nthe State Engineer can’t evaluate or\napprove it,” said Bruce Frederick, the Law\nCenter attorney who filed the motion on\nbehalf of about 80 residents who live in\nwest-central New Mexico. “Under our law,”\nstated Frederick, “no corporation or any\nother person can monopolize or hoard an\nentire supply of free public water for the\npurpose of speculative future sales. It’s\nunconstitutional and flies in the face of\nover 150 years of western water law, \nwhich is based on beneficial use.”\nIn addition to several tribes and pueblos\nthat signed on to the Law Center motion,\nthe Law Center has some interesting \nbedfellows in this case, including the \nfederal Bureau of Reclamation and the\nMiddle Rio Grande Conservancy District.\nThe hearing examiner assigned to the case\nwill hear oral arguments beginning on May\n20th. The location of the oral argument \nhas not yet been established.\nFirst Round in Preventing New Mexico’s Largest\nWater Grab Law Center is leader in case \nto stop massive water speculation\nEnvironment Escapes\nUnscathed\nThe Law Center and allies like\nConservation V oters New Mexico\nwere able to prevent any anti-\nenvironmental bills from becoming\nlaw during this year’s Legislative\nSession.

The Chief Justice\nquestioned Kennedy on what authority the\nGovernor had to halt the printing, asking:\n“Wouldn’t you agree that no person is above\nthe rule of law?” Justice Chavez added, “I\ndon’t see how the Governor has the\nauthority to trump the law. Then the\nGovernor can trump\nany law.”\nAfter a recess of only thirty minutes, the\nCourt returned, and Chief Justice Daniels \nstated that the Court would issue a writ\nagainst the State \nRecords Administrator, \ncompelling her to printthe rules.

If the Supreme\nCourt did not intercede, they argued, any\nparty could sue at any time to stop any State\nagency from even considering new \nregulations in the future.\n“Wewould have – and we would deserve\n– chaos,” Frederick argued in his rebuttal.\n“State agency proceedings could easily be\nshut down by any lawyer who can spot a legal\nissue, no matter how frivolous, and the district\ncourts would become clogged with random\nand premature\ndeclaratory judgment\nactions.”\nIn response, the\nSupreme Court\nissued a Writ of\nSuperintending\nControl, which\nordered the district\njudge to dismiss the\ncase, and allowed the\nEIB to resume our\nclimate change\nhearing in August.\nAnnouncing the \nruling after only 15\nminutes of delibera-\ntions, Supreme Court\nChief Justice Charles\nDaniels stated that\nthe case raised serious\nseparation of powers\nissues and that the \ndistrict court had\nmistakenly interfered\nwith an ongoing\nexecutive agency\nproceeding.\nThe Supreme Court\ncase sprang from a\nlawsuit filed by four state lawmakers, \nbusiness /industry groups and our state’s\nutilities to stop the EIB from considering\nNew Energy Economy’s (our client’s) petition\nto limit greenhouse gas emissions in the\nstate. In January, they filed their suit in a\ndistrict court in Lea County – the \ncapital of our state’s oil region.\nOn a windy April day at the\nLovington courthouse, Judge\nWilliam G.W.

There, we made the\ncase to the U.S. 10th \nCircuit Court of Appeals that the\nuranium mining license granted\nto Hydro Resources should be\nthrown out. At the heart of my\nlegal arguments was the \ncontention that uranium mining\nin these communities will \ndamage the health of the people who drink\nthe water and breathe the air that these\nmines will impact.  \nUnfortunately, two of the three judges on\nour panel deferred to the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission (NRC) – an agency that has\nhistorically promoted uranium mining and\nthe nuclear industry. The decision was not\nunanimous; Judge Carlos Lucero dissented\n“because the majority’s decision in this case\nwill unnecessarily and unjustifiably \ncompromise the health and safety of the \npeople who currently live within and \nimmediately downwind from [the minesite].”\nIt is one of the strongest dissents that my\ncolleagues and I have ever seen. Despite\nJudge Lucero’s dissent, however, the Court\nrefused our request for an en banc review, in\nwhich all of the active judges on the 10th\nClients Chris Shuey of the Southwest Research \nand Information Center (SRIC) and Larry King \nof the Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium \nMining (ENDAUM) discuss potential uranium \nmining at King’s home in Church Rock.\nCircuit bench would have reviewed the\ndecision.\nIn a separate, but related case, the 10th\nCircuit overturned its previous ruling on\nwhich entity will regulate the groundwater\nbeneath the first proposed minesite. The new\nruling states that the proposed Church Rock\nSection 8 site, despite being in a community\nthat is 97% Navajo, falls under the \njurisdiction of the New Mexico Environment\nDept. The issue at hand – who governs an\nIndian community in the Checkerboard\nregion – is legally significant, and it is likely\nthat the Navajo Nation (which was a party\nto the case, along with the U.S. EPA and\nHydro Resources, Inc.) will not be satisfied\nwith the appellate decision. For our clients,\nthis ruling is especially significant because\nby Eric J\nantz\nit means that the Navajo Nation’s\nban on  uranium mining no longer\napplies to the site. \nDespite these rulings, this case\nis far from over\n. We are preparing\nfor permitting proceedings before\nthe NM Environment Department\nlater this year. If you are a \nmember of the Law Center, you\nknow that as long as our clients\nin Crownpoint and Church Rock\ncontinue their struggle, we will\nfight beside them. My colleagues\nand I will keep you apprised of\nour efforts.\nThank you for \nsupporting our work.\nthereafter, he ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.\nWe had to move quickly to preserve both\nour climate change hearing, and the \nsanctity of the public rulemaking process in\nNew Mexico– and so made the rare move\nof appealing directly to the Supreme Court.\n“The Supreme Court does not do some-\nthing like this unless there are extraordinary\ncircumstances involved,” says Frederick,\nnoting that only five percent of requests for\nWrits of Superintending Control have been\ngranted during the past eight decades.“The\nLovington district court and EIB are two\nseparate branches of government.The court\ncannot intercede in a state agency appeal–\nthe separation of powers issue made for\nthis extraordinary circumstance.” \n“We were confident that the Supreme\nCourt would put us back on track.We can\nfinally move ahead to create clean ener gy\njobs, provide a level playing field for small\nbusiness and the renewable energy industry,\nand prove that solving global warming will\ncatalyze job creation,”said John Fogarty,\nExecutive Director of New Energy Economy.\nFrederick is confident that the EIB \nhearings will resume and finish by the end\nof the summer.\nSupreme Court Story continued from page 1\nA member of Students Against Uranium Mining on\nthe steps of the federal courthouse in May2008.\n©photo by Juana Colón\n\nCase Updates\nTwenty Two Years of Environmental and Community Victories    3\nWith New Mexico being the 7th largest\nproducer of dairy products in the nation,\nwe’re also one of our country’sbiggest\nproducers of cow manure. That much\nmanure\n– approximately 2.2 billion gallons\nper year – can wreak havoc on aquifers,\nfouling them with nitrates, phosphorus,\nammonia, human pathogens and hormones\n… not to mention the smell.    \nThe problem dairies pose to water quality\nis not small. Of the roughly 150 dairies\noperating in New Mexico, approximately\n57% of them have documented groundwater\npollution (for those that monitor groundwater\nquality), and a third are in abatement.\nSome of this contamination is historic, and\nnew liners for liquid waste lagoons are \nbetter than their predecessors at preventing\nleakage. At the same time, however, no one\nis sure how well technology can treat this\ncontamination (no dairy has been fully\nremediated in New Mexico yet), and we\nknow that cleaning up polluted groundwater\nis never cheap or easy.   \nTo address these problems, and to comply\nwith a legislative mandate, the NM\nEnvironment Department has drafted dairy-\nspecific regulations to protect groundwater.\nBut in some situations, the regulations don’t\ngo far enough.  So when our state’swater\nquality watchdogs wanted to plug the holes\nin the State’s proposal, they turned to the\nLaw Center for help.\nSome key provisions for which the \nLaw Center and its clients [Amigos Bravos,\nCaballo Concerned Citizens Group, Citizens\nfor Dairy Reform, the Rio Grande Chapter\nof the Sierra Club, and Food and Water\nWatch] are advocating for:\n• A minimum separation of 30’ between the  \nbottom of manure lagoons and ground-\nw\nater, instead of the 4’recommended by \nthe State.\n• Stricter setback requirements, including a \nbuf\nfer of at least 1 mile between dairies \nand populations of 10 or more homes or \nbusinesses, and keeping untreated waste \naway from food crops.\n• Increased monitoring and reporting.\n• A company must state in its permit \napplication how many cows will be \nhoused at the dairy\n.\n• A company must send a map of its \nproposed location to neighbors as part of \nthe public notification process.\n• A company must submit a closure plan \nwith its application, and must provide a   \nreclamation bond that would fund \ncleanup, in the event that the company \ncannot clean up the site when it closes.  \nNew Mexico Mooo-ving Towards Groundwater Protection\n“By planning in advance, \nwe will reduce the costs to\nthese companies, and reduce\nthe amount of contamination.”\n–Brian Shields,\nDirector of Amigos Bravos, responding \nto Commissioner Howard Hutchinson’\ns \nquestion about why public interest \ngroups want dairies to have plans \nin place for closure.\nWhere are \nNew Mexico’s dairies?\n75% – Eastern\n[Curry, Roosevelt, Chaves, Eddy + \nLea Counties]\n– approx. 266,000 cows\n15% – Southern\n[Doña Ana, Sierra + Luna Counties] \n– approx. 53,000 cows\n10% – Albuquerque Area\n[primarily South Valley] \n– approx. 35,500 cows\nLiquid dairy waste pours from two pipes into a ditch \nthat travels to nearby fields.\nby Shelbie Knox\n©photo by Roderick Ventura and Sarah Piltch Staff Attorneys Jon Block and Bruce\nFrederick represented our clients at a 4-\nweek hearing before the Environmental\nImprovement Board.

In March, the NM\nEnvironment Department handed them a\nsmall but significant victory, included in an\norder renewing Homestake’s groundwater\ndischarge permit for its collection and \nevaporation ponds.\nThe renewal came on the heels of a \npublic hearing, held in Grants in January.  \nAt the hearing, Staff Attorney Jon Block\nrepresented members of the Bluewater\nValley Downstream Alliance (BVDA), a\ngrassroots groups comprised of citizens \nliving in the shadow of the mill’s massive\ntailings piles. In addition to presenting \ncommunity concerns, the group submitted\ntechnical testimony from Paul Robinson,\nResearch Director at the Southwest \nResearch and Information Center (SRIC),\nassisted by Chris Shuey, MPH, SRIC's\nEnvironmental Health Specialist.\nIn his order renewing the permit,\nSecretary of the Environment Department\nRon Curry specifically agreed that \n“residents have reason to be frustrated with\nprogress to date, and suspicious of promises\nof remediation timelines.” He then stated\nthat a study being conducted by the\nArmy Corps of Engineers (and due to be\ncompleted this year) may “prompt \nmodifications to the larger remediation \nstrategy of the Mill Site.”\n“This is the first time anyone from the\nState has acknowledged the issues and \nfrustrations that our clients have expressed,”\nexplains Jon. “It is also the first time that a\nregulatory agency has provided some hope\nby indicating a commitment to restore\ngroundwater to usable condition in the \nforeseeable future – and the first time they\nhave offered the possibility of requiring\nHomestake to change course if the study\nshows that the company’s current \nreclamation efforts are not succeeding. Our\nhope is that the Environment Dept. has opened\nthe door to working with BVDA and other\ninterested community organizations, to come\nup with a realistic human time-bounded\nclean up solution for this Superfund site. \nThe fact that Secretary Curry told us that \nhis Water Quality people will be paying \nattention to the Army Corp of Engineer's\nassessment of the site is something we view\nas a positive step.”  \nContamination from the massive mill\ncomplex has plagued residents for more than\nforty years. Because of unsafe levels of \nuranium, selenium and nitrates in drinking\nwater wells, the company was required to\nhaul water to families, hook residents up \nSoon after Staff Attorney Jon Block began working with the Greater Gardner Neighborhood\nAssociation in Albuquerque to appeal an air quality permit, he realized it would be an uphill\nfight.  For two years, residents of the neighborhood had fought the operational expansion of\nthe American Cement transfer facility, which often spewed hazardous cement dust into their\nyards, homes, schools and businesses. Despite vocal opposition and documentation of \npollution, the Albuquerque-Bernalillo County Joint Air Quality Division issued a permit to\nthe facility that allowed it to operate 24 hours a day/ 365 days per year, and allowed it to\nmore than quadruple its emissions.\n“This was yet another example of how the Air Quality Division does not consider public\ntestimony when considering air quality permits,” explained Jon “So, we decided to get the\nresults we wanted without them.”\nJon helped residents set up settlement negotiations with Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua\n(GCC), the owner of the facility and one of the larger cement producers in the northern\nhemisphere. “From my experience with these kinds of matters, I knew that attorneys would\nlikely complicate the proceedings. So I suggested that opposing counsel and I stay out of the\nroom, and let our clients and the company participate in a mediated negotiation – something\nthat had not taken place during the permitting process.”\nThe result was a win-win for the Greater Gardner Neighborhood Association and the\ncompany. Among other outcomes, the company has agreed to install state-of-the-art \nmonitoring equipment at the site, and is working with neighbors to implement a panel \ncomprised of residents and company representatives to address any future concerns.\n“We’re very pleased that our clients walked away with what they wanted,” says Jon.\n“However, both they and I remain frustrated that this fight could have been avoided had the\nCity implemented a stakeholder process early on. Until the Air Division and the Board\nbecome more responsive to citizens, I believe we will be working with residents in\nAlbuquerque for a long time to come in their fights against air pollution.”\n“Residents have reason to \nbe frustrated with progress \nto date, and suspicious of \npromises of remediation \ntimelines.\n”– NMED Secretary Ron Curry\nto Milan’s municipal water system, and\npay residents’ water bills for a decade. \nNot satisfied with these stopgap measures,\nour clients at the BVDA continue to fight\nfor true reclamation of the site and \nremediation of local groundwater.\nStaff Attorney Jon Block is flanked by clients\nfrom the Greater Gardner Neighborhood\nAssociation.

So it is no wonder that the\nnuclear industry is now crowing about its\npending revival and lining up for federally-\nfunded subsidies and loan guarantees.\nUranium mining is also benefiting from\nthe buzz. Last year, the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission “streamlined” its uranium\nmine licensing process because of an \nanticipated surge in license applications.\nThis Spring, FORBES magazine featured a\nstory about uranium mining’s potential for\nbig profits. We’ve known that the threat\nhas been growing – during 2009 our \nuranium caseload grew from three cases \nto twelve. In addition to our Crownpoint\nUranium Project and Homestake Mill\ncases, here’s the latest on the mines\nopposed by our clients:\n•Roca Honda mine, on Mount \n Taylor:\nThis is the first time that a uranium \ncompany is seeking a full-fledged mining\npermit in New Mexico (mining permits\nweren’\nt required until 1993) This case will\ndetermine how the State deals with pro-\nposed uranium mines for decades to come.\n• Mount Taylor mine, on Mount T\n aylor:\nFortunately, the State of Colorado recently\npassed a law prohibiting General Atomics'\nfrom opening its Cañon City\n, CO uranium\nmill until that site is remediated. It is\nbelieved that remediation will take 50–100\nyears. Because General Atomics will be\nunable to process the ore from the Mount\nTaylor mine, in June the company backed\noff of plans to reopen the mine.\n• Nichols Ranch mine/Lost Creek\nmine/Moor\ne Ranch mine, in Wyoming,\nand Dewey/Burdock mine in South\nDakota: As one of the few law firms to\nwork on federal uranium mine licensing\nover the past decade, we didn’\nt hesitate to\nhelp oppose these license applications,\ndespite their distance from New Mexico.\nThese cases will determine the extent to\nwhich regulators at the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission can utilize its new licensing\nUranium: Boom or Bubble?\n© photo by Cole Merrick\nprocess that will  restrict opportunities \nfor public participation and limit the\nrequirements for site-specific studies at\nproposed in situ leach uranium mines.\n•Pandora Mine, Moab, UT: Our most\nrecent uranium case involves a lawsuit\nagainst the US Forest Service, which has\napproved a plan to expand the Pandora\nMine on federal land near Moab. \nThis \nlawsuit will help determine how federal\nland management agencies permit \nuranium mines in the future.\nFor more information on these cases,\nplease see the“Case”pages on our website.\n\n© Vavruska photo of a Storm clearing over the Ortiz Mountains\n6 w w w.nmelc.org\nThankYous\nNews\nThank you to the funders, sponsors and contributors who make the work of the Law Center possible.  \nContributions made July1, 2009 - May 15, 2010\nBoard of Directors\nStuart Bluestone, President, Santa Fe\nFrank Sanchez, Vice-President, Roswell\nDiana Bustamante, Secretary , La Mesa\nRobby Rodriguez, Treasurer,  Albuquerque\nMyron Armijo, Santa Ana Pueblo\nDavid Henderson, Santa F e\nSusanne Hoffman-Dooley, Santa Fe\nDonna House, Alcalde\nRenee Ingold, Cerrillos\nPablo Padilla, Jr., Zuni Pue blo\nDale Pontius, Santa Fe\nAlice Van Buren, Santa Fe\nStaff\nJonathan M.

Alone I can’t fight for the \nsanctity of the views that belong to us all, but through my \nsupport of the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, \nI can feel secure in the certainty that my interest and all \nour interests are being protected.\n– Sallie Bingham\n“\n”\n\nTwenty Two Years of Environmental and Community Victories    7\nWilliam Baxter\nKevin and Susan Bean \nSusan Bell\nReed and Melinda Benson\nJean L.

The Pit\nRule, for which the Law Center successfully\nadvocated in 2008, protects groundwater and\nland from oil and gas drilling wastes, which\noften contain carcinogens such as benzene\nand xylene.   \nBut the appeal is not the only threat that \nthe regulation faces.  On the campaign trail,\nGovernor-elect Susana Martinez’s vowed to\nabolish the Pit Rule.  Claiming that it costs\n$250,000 per pit to comply (the average is\ncloser to $35,000 per shallow well to $150,000\nper deep well, or roughly 3-5% of the total\ncost of drilling a well, according to industry\nexperts), Martinez blamed the Pit Rule for\nslowing the oil and gas industry in New\nMexico and driving drillers out of the state.\nBut Jantz points to a different culprit. “In a\nrecession, there is less demand for oil and gas\nand commodity prices fall as a result.  When\nthe economy comes back, the drillers will\ncome back.  And that is when the Pit Rule\nwill be more important than ever.”\nJantz also points to statements from the Oil\nConservation Division that, since the Rule\nwas adopted, there have been no leaking pits\nfound in New Mexico. “Keeping these toxic\nchemicals out of unlined pits means that\nwe’re keeping them\nout of the water,” \nhe adds.\nThe oil and gas\nindustry (as a\ngroup), after the\nRepublican\nGovernors’\nAssociation, were\nthe second most\ngenerous \ncontributors to\nGovernor-elect\nMartinez’s  \ncampaign.\nOther oil and \ngas threats on the\nhorizon?  In addi-\ntion to a probable\nattack on the Pit Rule by legislators, we\nanticipate that there may be an effort to\nundermine the ability of counties to enact\nlocal zoning regulations like the Santa Fe\nCounty Oil and Gas Ordinance. “A lot of\npeople worked with the Law Center to get\nthat ordinance enacted, and we are now\nworking with groups in other counties to\nhelp them advocate for similar \nprotections,” says Jantz. “We are \nready to fight for counties’ rights \nto protect themselves from \nirresponsible oil and gas drilling.”\nCan New Mexico Save the World?\nOur old familiar globe is suddenly \nmelting, drying, acidifying, flooding,\nand burning in ways that no human\nhas ever seen.

First, there are no underground\nworkers in ISL mines. Second, there are no\ntailings piles, so ISL mines throw off less\nradioactive air emissions than mines with\ntailings. But that is where the truth ends.\nOur opponents are trying very hard to get\ninvestors, and are working to relax \nregulations. So they do not talk about the\ntrue danger of this mining. ISL mining\nentails the intentional contamination of\naquifers with uranium and other heavy\nmetals – and it’s extremely difficult to clean\nup. In fact, not one mine in the world has\nbeen cleaned up to pre-mining condition.\nQ:  You filed the Law Center’s first \npetition to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nWhat happened?\nA: We asked the federal Supreme Court to\nreview the appellate decision that upheld\nHydro Resources’ license to mine uranium\nin the aquifer that supplies drinking water\nto the Crownpoint-Church Rock region.\nUnfortunately, in November 2010, the \njustices declined our petition.

In September he filed a motion to the New Mexico Environment\nDepartment (NMED) Secretary Ron Curry, asking him to deny Waste Connection’s\napplication for a 10 year permit.\n“For years, El Paso’s trash ended up in Sunland\nPark, to the tune of nearly 90% of the waste in the\nlandfill.  However, in August 2010, the City of El\nPaso adopted an ordinance that will keep El\nPaso’s waste in El Paso,” explains Meiklejohn.\n“This means that the waste stream to Sunland\nPark will dry up, and the landfill’s representation\nthat almost all of its waste will come from El Paso\nis not accurate.”\nWaste Connections responded in late\nSeptember;  Secretary Curry is slated to make his\ndecision about the permit by November 1st.  \nComings & Goings\nThe Law Center welcomes two new board members: Harry Browne of Silver City, and\nMichael Casaus of Albuquerque.  Harry served for several years as the Executive\nDirector of the Gila Resources Information Project (GRIP), and Michael is the Sierra\nClub’s Senior Field Organizing Director for New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Texas.\nAt the same time, we bid farewell to Dale Pontius, an incredible board member and\npresident who injected a great deal of energy into the organization. Finally, thank you\nto our wonderful summer interns, Cole Merrick and Joel Minor.\nMount Taylor uranium mine kept on standby \nby Colorado\nThe Mount Taylor uranium mine is not going to reopen anytime soon, thanks to a law\npassed by the State of Colorado this spring.  Ore from the Mount Taylor mine, which is\nowned by General Atomics, was slated to be milled at the company’s Cotter mill in\nCañon City, CO. But Colorado adopted a law in May 2010 that prevents the mill (which\nwas classified as a Superfund site during the 1980s) from accepting new uranium until it\ncleans up its existing mess.\nIn response, General Atomics\nshut down the Cotter \nfacility in August, 2010.\nCommunity Takes on One of New Mexico’s Worst Neighbors\nResidents defy company to advocate for clean air\n“I don’t believe I’ve come across a company that is so unwilling to \ndo the right thing.”\nThose aren’t the words of our clients, the neighbors who comprise\nthe Mesquite Community Action Committee (MCAC).  Those of the\nwords of NMED Secretary Ron Curry, describing the Helena\nChemical company. \nThe Helena Chemical fertilizer blending facility in Mesquite has \nan extensive track record of air quality and water quality violations.\nAfter neighbors fought for years to stop the plant from polluting \ntheir community, Helena sued MCAC member Arturo Uribe for\ndefamation.  A jury awarded the company $2 in damages and $75,000\nin punitive damages. (The award has since been reduced, and Uribe \ncontinues to appeal.)\nDespite the company’s heavy-handed tactics, neighbors refuse to\nback down.    \nIn 2005, the Law Center helped MCAC successfully demand that\nthe company obtain an air quality permit.  But three years (and 15 \nviolations) later, the company entered into a fight with NMED, \narguing that it does not require the permit.  Now the matter is before\nthe Environmental Improvement Board (EIB), which handles air \nquality permit appeals. \nIn July, Law Center\nStaff Attorney Jon\nBlock traveled to\nMesquite to help\nneighbors prepare \ntestimony for an EIB\nhearing.  At the \nhearing, residents\nspoke about dust\nescaping from the\nblending facility, about\nfacility doors left open,\nand about their \nexasperation from \nliving next door to a\ncompany that flouts\nthe law.\nWe are awaiting a\ndecision from the EIB as to whether or not the company requires the\nair quality permit.  If the EIB rules in favor of the company, we will\nconsult with the MCAC as to whether it wishes to appeal.   \nLaw Center intern Cole Merrick traveled with Jon to document the\ntrip.  In addition to his photo documentation of Jon Block, MCAC \nmembers (including Arturo, in beard and sunglasses), and the facility\n(right), Cole submitted an affidavit to the hearing officer detailing his\nfirst-hand account of the trip.\n© photo credit Joel Minor\nStay connected and informed! \nFacebook.com/NMELC\nTwitter.com/NMELC\nSign up for our monthly\neNewsletteronline!\nhttp://www.nmelc.org\nPhoto courtesy Concerned Citizens of\nSunland Park\n\n\n© Vavruska photo of a Storm clearing over the Ortiz Mountains\nTwenty Three Years of Environmental and Community Victories    76 w w w.nmelc.org\nNews\nThank you to the funders, Green Business Partners, and contributors who make the work of the Law Center possible.\nContributions made June 1, 2009 – September 30, 2010 .\nKirt Kempter, Ph.D.\nDavid King\nShelbie Knox and David Clark\nRuth and Paul Kovnat\nKozon Law Office, PC\nRobert and Julie Kresge\nPatricia Kuhlhoff\nDonald Kurtz and \nElizabeth Gutierrez\nLakind Dental Group\nJoan Bluestone Landorf\nLyle F . and Jaclyn Lane\nMichael and Barbara Langner\nRichard and Sylvia LaPan\nSusan Larsen, DVM\nDavid and Barbara Larson\nRobin Laughlin\nKirsten Lear\nSuzanne LeBeau\nCollis Lee, Jr.\nLinda Lee\nNancy Lehrhaupt\nDeirdre Lennihan\nJason A.

The Pit\nRule, for which the Law Center successfully\nadvocated in 2008, protects groundwater and\nland from oil and gas drilling wastes, which\noften contain carcinogens such as benzene\nand xylene.   \nBut the appeal is not the only threat that \nthe regulation faces.  On the campaign trail,\nGovernor-elect Susana Martinez’s vowed to\nabolish the Pit Rule.  Claiming that it costs\n$250,000 per pit to comply (the average is\ncloser to $35,000 per shallow well to $150,000\nper deep well, or roughly 3-5% of the total\ncost of drilling a well, according to industry\nexperts), Martinez blamed the Pit Rule for\nslowing the oil and gas industry in New\nMexico and driving drillers out of the state.\nBut Jantz points to a different culprit. “In a\nrecession, there is less demand for oil and gas\nand commodity prices fall as a result.  When\nthe economy comes back, the drillers will\ncome back.  And that is when the Pit Rule\nwill be more important than ever.”\nJantz also points to statements from the Oil\nConservation Division that, since the Rule\nwas adopted, there have been no leaking pits\nfound in New Mexico. “Keeping these toxic\nchemicals out of unlined pits means that\nwe’re keeping them\nout of the water,” \nhe adds.\nThe oil and gas\nindustry (as a\ngroup), after the\nRepublican\nGovernors’\nAssociation, were\nthe second most\ngenerous \ncontributors to\nGovernor-elect\nMartinez’s  \ncampaign.\nOther oil and \ngas threats on the\nhorizon?  In addi-\ntion to a probable\nattack on the Pit Rule by legislators, we\nanticipate that there may be an effort to\nundermine the ability of counties to enact\nlocal zoning regulations like the Santa Fe\nCounty Oil and Gas Ordinance. “A lot of\npeople worked with the Law Center to get\nthat ordinance enacted, and we are now\nworking with groups in other counties to\nhelp them advocate for similar \nprotections,” says Jantz. “We are \nready to fight for counties’ rights \nto protect themselves from \nirresponsible oil and gas drilling.”\nCan New Mexico Save the World?\nOur old familiar globe is suddenly \nmelting, drying, acidifying, flooding,\nand burning in ways that no human\nhas ever seen.

His article ran after we\npetitioned the State on behalf of NEE to\nadopt the country’s most significant limits\non carbon emissions.  \nIn April, we and the NM Environment\nDepartment (NMED) both argued – and won\n– an important decision from the New\nMexico Environmental Improvement Board\nthat the Board can regulate greenhouse gases\nas air pollutants.  We were opposed by many\nof New Mexico’s biggest corporations and\ntrade groups, including PNM, the NM Oil\nand Gas Association, and the Dairy Producers\nof New Mexico; their experts testified that\ngreenhouse gases fall outside of the Board’s\njurisdiction. \nAs a result of this decision, the Board will\nhold a public hearing in late 2009 or 2010 to\ndetermine whether to impose a cap on \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and if so, what\nthat cap should be. At that hearing, we will\nargue that New Mexico must take the route \ndictated by nearly all of the world’s climate\nscientists: we must reduce our greenhouse\ngas emissions by at least 25% below 1990\nlevels by 2020 or face catastrophic impacts.\nNMED will likely argue that the State\nshould adopt the carbon caps recommended\nby the Western Climate Initiative, which\nwould lower our state’s \nemissions by 15%\nbelow 2005 levels by 2020.\n“We’ve reached a point where we can no\nlonger take half-measures,” says Bruce\nFrederick, counsel on the case. “Our job at\nthe hearing will be to advocate that New\nMexico must adopt the carbon caps \nchampioned by 1,200 of the world’s leading\nscientists; if we don’t, we face catastrophic\nproblems such as prolonged drought, new\ndiseases and massive wildfires, to name a\nfew. Granted, New Mexico is a small fish in\na global pond of carbon emitters, but if \nNew Mexico can do what is \nscientifically necessary, other \nstates can do it as well. Our \nleadership on this issue will help \nour country become part of the \nclimate solution, instead of a \nbig part of the climate problem.”\n“So if you can shape your renewables, you\ndon't need fossil fuel or nuclear plants to\nrun all the time. And, in fact, most plants\nrunning all the time in your system are an\nimpediment because they're very inflexible.\nYou can't ramp up and ramp down a\nnuclear plant. And if you have instead the\nability to ramp up and ramp down loads in\nways that can shape the entire system, then\nthe old concept of [coal and nuclear power]\nbecomes an anachronism.”\n– Jon Wellinghoff, Chair of the Federal \nEnergy Regulation Commission, to the \nU.S. Energy Association, April 21, 2009.\nCoal Power Plant Chimney – Black and White\n© Danicek | Dreamstime.com\n“\n”\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nOur plan - 25.5 tons\nState plan - 44 tons\nCurrent trajectory - 70 tons\nCarbon emissions by 2020\n\nNuclear Revitalization Commission?\nCase Updates\nBig Copper Goes to Court \nAfter the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n(NRC) licensed uranium mines in the drink-\ning water aquifer underlying the Crownpoint-\nChurch Rock region, we thought perhaps \nthe agency should be renamed the Nuclear\nRevitalization Commission. After reading\nthe NRC’s final draft of the Generic\nEnvironmental Impact Statement (GEIS) for\nin \nsitu leach (ISL) uranium mining, we are\npretty sure that the name change is in order.\nThe Final GEIS, released on June 5th,\naddresses common environmental issues\nassociated with the construction, operation,\nand decommissioning of ISL facilities, as\nwell as groundwater restoration at such\nfacilities in Nebraska, New Mexico, South\nDakota and Wyoming. The NRC explains \non its website that it developed the GEIS in\norder to facilitate its review of a large number\nof anticipated ISL uranium mining license\napplications.  As of May 2009, the agency is\nexpecting 17 such applications before the\nend of 2010.\nThe Law Center submitted technical \ncomments in November 2008, most of\nwhich seem to have been ignored by the\nNRC. The agency did bend on one signifi-\ncant point, however.  Instead of requiring\nEnvironmental Assessments at new proposed\nmines, the agency will require the completion\nof Supplemental Environmental Impact\nStatements before it makes licensing\ndecisions. Environmental Impact\nStatements involve more thorough site-\nspecific reviews than Assessments, and\nhave provisions for public comment. \n“The decision to do ‘full’ environmental\nreviews is positive,” says Law Center Staff\nAttorney Jonathan Block. “But one has to\ntake a wait-and-see attitude because you’re\ndealing with an agency that has a very bad\nhistory in terms of handling these kinds \nof matters.” \nWe are working with our clients to\ndevelop our next steps in this case.\nOn another front, the uranium industry\nis pushing the NRC to allow it to build\ninfrastructure at proposed in ISL mines\nbefore those mines are licensed. Industry\nrepresentatives met with NRC staff in\nNovember 2008 to outline their pre-\nlicensing construction plan.  \nTo date, we have agreed with the NRC’s\ninterpretation of the rule, which does not\nallow companies to build first and get\nlicensed later.\n“This is just a terrible idea,” says Block,\nwho submitted comments to the NRC on\nthis matter in May. “If regulators let \ncorporations sink millions of dollars into\ninfrastructure, then they have less ability \nto turn the projects down, which is exactly\nwhat these companies are gambling on.”\nPHOTO– Oil W ell Site Work\n© Neonriver | Dreamstime.com\n2 w w w.nmelc.org\nIn January 2009, we had a major victory when the NM Water Quality Control Commission\nruled that Freeport McMoRan (formerly Phelps Dodge) is responsible for cleaning up the\nacidic, metals-laden groundwater beneath its 12,000 acre Tyrone mine complex. \nTwo months later, the company appealed to the state appellate court to overturn the\nCommission’s ruling. Law Center Staff Attorney Bruce Frederick represents the Gila\nResources Information Project (GRIP), a Silver City-based non-profit group, in this litigation.\n“Contrary to the arguments put forth by Freeport McMoRan, contaminated groundwater \ndoesn’t just stop at the company’s fenceline,” says Frederick. “We will argue to the Court of\nAppeals that the Commission made the right decision for Tyrone, and the right decision \nfor New Mexico.”\nThe outcome of this case will impact the ability of the Commission to mandate \ngroundwater cleanup at large industrial sites throughout the State.\n\nCase Updates\nTwenty One Years of Environmental and Community Victories    3\nNeutron Energy\ngets Green Light\nUranium company Hydro Resources, Inc.\n(HRI) is having a tough year so far. In\nMarch, its biggest investor, Itochu Corp. \nof Japan, dissolved its partnership with the\nbeleaguered uranium mining company.\nLess than a month later, HRI lost a critical\ndecision in the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of\nAppeals.\nIn a lawsuit against the federal govern -\nment, HRI contended that its Church Rock\nSection 8 property in the “Checkerboard”\nregion bordering the Navajo Nation is like\nany other private land in New Mexico, and\nsubject to State jurisdiction.  However, after\nexamining evidence that 97% of the \ncommunity surrounding the Section 8 \nminesite is Navajo, two of the three judges\nhearing the case disagreed with the company,\nand ruled that the proposed minesite falls\nunder tribal and federal jurisdiction.\n(While the Law Center was key to the\nadministrative proceedings pertaining to this\nruling, we did not participate in the federal\nlawsuit.)\nThe ruling could affect HRI in two ways.\nFirst, if the company has no other setbacks,\nit would be required to apply for and\nreceive an “underground injection control\npermit” from the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency before it could begin\nmining. Second, and more important, \nthe ruling could signal that HRI’s proposed\nmining would be prohibited under the\nNavajo Nation’s ban on uranium mining\nand milling.\n“The ruling rejects the position of HRI,\nwhich contended that its small island of\n[private] land was, in essence, excluded\nfrom the community,” Navajo Nation\nResources Committee Chairman George\nArthur told the Gallup \nIndependent.\nArthur, who sponsored the mining ban, \ncontinued, “That position would allow the\nfabric of Navajo communities to be\ndestroyed from within anytime there is a\nsmall tract of non-Indian land within the\ncommunity boundaries.”\nThis is a significant ruling, and if it \nstands, will be very useful to our clients in\ntheir effort to defeat HRI’s ill-conceived\nscheme to mine uranium in the drinking\nwater aquifer for these communities.\nHopefully, HRI has not yet seen the last of\nthe bad news this year. We are still awaiting\na ruling from the 10th Circuit Court on our\nlawsuit against the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission to overturn the mining license\nit granted to HRI in 1996. \nHydro Resources Dealt Major Setbacks\nIs Hydro Resources looking at Easy Street…or an\nAvenue of broken dreams? URANIUM DRIVE © Alptraum | Dreamstime.com\nFor more than a year, Law Center \nattorney Eric Jantz worked with the Haaku\nWater Office of Acoma Pueblo to prevent\nthe issuance of the state’s first non-minimal\nimpact exploration permit for uranium. In\nthe end, however, the Mining and Minerals\nDivision granted the permit for Neutron\nEnergy’s Marquez Canyon site. Neutron\nEnergy will drill on the flank of Mt. Taylor\n(\nKaweshtima, in the Keres language), a\nsite that is culturally important to as many\nas 30 Native American tribes.  \n“This is the first time that the State has\nissued this type of permit for uranium, ”\nsays Jantz. “Because of the element’s toxic\nand radiological characteristics, as well as\nits readiness to mobilize into groundwater \nwhen exposed to oxygen, uranium mining\nrequires a higher level of regulation than\nother hardrock mining.”  \nWhen asked about the decision, Jantz\nreflected, “Unfortunately, in our legal \nsystem, cultural destruction is not enough\nto prevent mining.  The only silver lining\nis that we did set some good environment\nprecedent with this permit, which should\ntranslate to future uranium permits in \nNew Mexico.”\nOn April 28, 2009, the National\nTrust for Historic Preservation\nnamed Mt.

He maintains that the\nordinance will make it impossible for oil and\ngas development to occur in the Galisteo\nBasin, and has promised that NMOGA will\nsue to overturn the Ordinance, although that\nlawsuit has yet to materialize.  \n“This will not make it impossible to drill,”\nrebuts Jantz. “What it will do, for the first\ntime in New Mexico, is ensure that oil and\ngas drillers will have to be good neighbors.\nIt is just common sense that it will take\nseveral layers of protection to guarantee \nthat an inherently toxic industry can operate\nas a good neighbor.”\nJantz does not believe that the fight is\nover, however. In addition to a future \npossible lawsuit, Law Center attorneys\nworked vigorously to defeat bad legislation\nand support good bills, such as the \nFree\nMarket in Energy Restoration Act,\nsponsored by Brian Egolf, which would\nhave provided new protections for land-\nowners who do not own their mineral rights.\nAnatomy of the Ordinance\nThe Santa Fe County Oil and Gas\nOrdinance seeks to “promote \nthe health, safety and welfare of \nthe County, its residents, and its \nenvironment by regulating\nadverse public nuisance and / or\nland use impacts and effects\nresulting from the exploration,\ndrilling, operation, and \ntransportation of oil and gas.”\nSome precedent-setting\naspects of the Ordinance:\n• Significant baseline studies and\nmodeling will be required before\npermits are issued.\n• Ecologically- and culturally-\nsensitive areas have been identi-\nfied, and will be closed to drilling.\n• Companies will be required \nto use non-toxic fluids to fracture underground\nrock strata in order to release oil and gas for\npumping to the surface.\n• Drillers, rather than taxpayers, will be\nrequired to pay for new County services such\nas road paving and public safety that would\naccompany the growth of the industry.\n• Drillers must keep surface disturbance to\na minimum.\nCheck out http://www.ogilviephoto.com/go/Oil/ and\nhttp://www.ogilviephoto.com/go/Tecton/ for more oil \nand gas photos.

The Law Center and our client\nare preparing to defend the decision before\nthe NM Court of Appeals later this year.\nPHOTO–\nAttorney Bruce Frederick and\nFreeport McMoRan’s Tyrone pit\nfrom the air, April 2008.\nCourtesy of GRIP.\n• There are an estimated 100,000\nactive and inactive pits in New Mexico. \n• Industry is required to report any\nrelease of more than 210 gallons. \n• As of December 2008, the Oil\nConservation Division is aware of more\nthan 500 self-reported groundwater\ncontamination instances related to pits.\nThe ink was barely dry on the New\nMexico’s new Oil Pit Rule when the NM\nIndependent Petroleum Association,\nConocoPhillips and others sued to overturn\nit NM District Court.  The new Rule, for\nwhich the Law Center ardently advocated\nin 2007, is the most stringent in the nation;\nit governs the management and disposal of\ntoxic drilling by-products at drilling sites.  \nSome requirements:  \n• All temporary disposal pits must be   \npermitted by the State, and all pits must   \nhave heavy-duty liners.\n• Drillers must use “closed-loop” tanks \nnear water resources, rather than storing \nwastes in open pits that can leak into \nnearby wells, rivers or groundwater. \n• A significant amount of contamination \nmust be hauled to licensed disposal sites; \nwaste disposed of on-site must meet \ngroundwater quality standards before \nbeing buried.\nOn behalf of the Oil and Gas Accountability\nProject, the Law Center intervened in the\nappeal in order to defend the Rule. We are\nalso working to fight industry-backed efforts\nto weaken the Pit Rule through other\nchannels; this case is unfolding as we go to\npress, so please see our website for updates.\n> Please see our website for Jantz’s brief, March 2008 testimony before the NM Oil\nConservation Commission about the toxic chemicals associated with oil and gas drilling, and \nfor a study that demonstrates economic benefits of closed-loop waste management systems. \nFacts\n2 w w w.nmelc.org\n\nCase Updates\nTwenty One Years of Environmental and Community Victories    3\nWork Heats Up on Climate Change Case UraniumNotes\nPhoto courtesy Ossy Werner\nJohn Fogarty, M.D., Executive Director of \nNew Energy Economy , speaks about New\nMexico’s imperative to be a leader in \naddressing climate change.\nThis chart was developed by New Energy Economy using data compiled the New Mexico Climate\nChange Advisory Group.  It gives a sector-by-sector breakout of how New Mexico can reduce its\ncarbon emissions by 20% by 2020.  \nIn January, Law Center Staff Attorney\nBruce Frederick overcame strong industry\nopposition to convince the NM\nEnvironmental Improvement Board (EIB)\nto grant a hearing on reducing the state’s\ngreenhouse gas emissions.  On behalf of\nour client, New Energy Economy, we are\npetitioning the Board to adopt new regula-\ntions that would dramatically reduce global\nwarming pollution over the next decade.\n“The science is clear that global warming\nis underway, and we must take immediate\naction,” says Dr. John Fogarty, Executive\nDirector for New Energy Economy. \nWe based the petition on the findings of\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange, a scientific entity composed of\nmore than 1,200 international scientists.\nThe Panel has concluded that developed\nnations must reduce global warming \npollution by at least 25% below 1990 levels\nby 2020 to avoid catastrophic changes. \nIf we are successful in our efforts,\nNew Mexico will lead the nation with\nthe most significant and strongest\nregulations in the United States.\nOther states, including California,\nClimate Change Advisory Group\nRecommendations to Reduce Emissions\nMMT CO2e\n90\n60\n30\n1980 1990        2000       2010      2020       2030\n34\n70 Buildings &\nEfficiency\nRenewables\nAg & Forests\nTrans & Fuels\nOil &  Gas\nThe Law Center continues to be a\nnational leader on uranium issues:\n• We submitted comments on the\nNuclear Regulatory Commission’s\n(NRC’s) nearly 500-page draft\nGeneric Environmental Impact\nStatement (GEIS) for in situ leach\n(ISL) uranium mining in Nebraska,\nNew Mexico, South Dakota and\nWyoming – all states that have\nsignificant indigenous populations\nliving near uranium deposits. The GEIS\nwould make it easier for companies\nto obtain ISL mining licenses. \nCheck our website to see our\ncomments and the draft GEIS.\n• We are still awaiting a decision\nfrom the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of\nAppeals in our lawsuit to overturn\nthe NRC license issued to Hydro\nResources, Inc.

The case was\nheard in Denver, CO, in May 2008.\n• In addition to the GEIS, above, we\nrepresent the Haaku Water Office of\nAcoma Pueblo on two cases. \n1) We represent the Water Office in \ngovernment-to-government consulta-\ntions with federal and state agencies\non uranium matters.  2) We oppose\nthe granting of the state’s first \nnon-minimal exploration permit for \nuranium.

We’re a little late, but are\nhappy to present the final five stories in that series. Please see our\nnew website for the remaining four stories.\nImagine an ambitious, talented lawyer with no corporate or\nwealthy clients, whose legal aspirations do not include remunerative\ncivil suits or elective office; an attorney guided by family tradition\nand a personal recognition that our legal system should do more to\nrepresent the least powerful among us.  And imagine a wife who\nshares those values and goals, who for over 40 years has supplied\nthe moral and financial support needed to make reality out of good\nintentions.\nThis is not imagination: it is Doug and Harriet Meiklejohn.\nIn 1977 Doug came to New Mexico to work in the Attorney\nGeneral’s office, working first in consumer protection efforts and\nlast on environmental cases, a sensitivity that his parents had\ninstilled in him.  In 1987 however, Garrey Carruthers became\nGovernor and Hal Stratton the Attorney General. Doug painfully\nrealized that their priorities did not include his central concerns,\nand that he could no longer address those concerns working for \nthe state.  \nThe 80s were a period of increased social and environmental\nactivism, with people around the U.S. experimenting with new,\nnon-governmental ways of making change.  In that heady time of\nmaking things better in spite of government, the Sierra Club Legal\nDefense Fund, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Southern\nEnvironmental Law Center, among others, were beginning to make\nlaws and the legal system work for – not against – the environment.\nMoved by these non-governmental efforts to improve the\nenvironment, Doug left state government and regular paychecks\nin 1987 and founded the Law Center. With three young children, to\ncall this a gamble is an understatement!  But from the start, the\nLaw Center had an angel keeping the Meiklejohn family afloat: her\nname is Harriet.  She was then – as now – a librarian. It would take\na long time for Doug to be earning “lawyer’s wages;” he’s still\nwaiting.  He and Harriet live in the same small house they lived in\nthen.\nReflecting Doug’s values, the Law Center “represents the least\npowerful among us,” usually Indian tribes and poor Hispanic\ncommunities that can’t afford legal counsel, but who live under\nthreats to their health or environment. Frequently, all costs of\ncarrying a case to conclusion are borne by grants and private\ndonations, not the client. Unfortunately, with its small staff and\nlimited resources, the Law Center has to turn away approximately\n80% of the cases that come to it.  \nA distinguishing Law Center characteristic is that it responds to\nrequests from communities.  It doesn’t tell them what they need;\nthe community determines its needs and the Center helps it\nachieve them.  The community members stay actively involved in\nthe case; it’s their case, not the Center’s.  It’s been a long haul\nsince Doug was a full-time volunteer founder-attorney. Today the\nLaw Center and its staff of eight (including four attorneys) is\nrecognized and honored for its work on behalf of New Mexico’s\nenvironment and communities.  Thank you, Doug and Harriet!\nReflecting Doug's values, the Law Center \nrepresents the \"least powerful among us,\" \nusually communities that can't afford \nlegal counsel, but who live under threats \nto their health or environment.\nOf Note\nOn February 5, Cornell Law \nSchool recognized Doug \nMeiklejohn ('71) for his \nlifetime of service as a public \ninterest attorney. Doug was \naccompanied to the \nceremony in New York City \nby attorney and Law Center \nBoard member Pablo Padilla, \nJr., who nominated Doug for \nthe award. Doug was also \nnominated by a classmate of his at Cornell.\nCongratulations, Doug!  \n© 2008 Alain McLaughlin\n\nNews\nTwenty One Years of Environmental and Community Victories    7\nLaw Center Joins 21st Century\nJustice Has\nNever Been \nSo Sweet\nCheck out our website –\nnmelc.org – with a new address\nand a new look! \nOur static site has been retired, and our new\nsite is up and running.

Community \nmembers from Crownpoint and \nChurch Rock, including nine middle-\nschoolers, Students Against Uranium \nMining or SAUM (see photo right), \ndrove up the night before to attend \nthe hearing that will directly affect \nthe quality of their drinking water. \nEric Jantz, lead \nattorney from \nthe Law Center, \nrepresented clients \nEastern Navajo \nDiné Against \nUranium Mining \n(ENDAUM) and \nSouthwest Research \nand Information \nCenter (SRIC) in their appeal \nagainst the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission’s (NRC) granting in-\nsitu leach mining permits to Hydro \nResources Inc. (HRI).  In his opening \nremarks Eric said “the question \nbefore you today, your honors, is \nwhether the NRC can disregard \nradiation from the mine waste at \nSection 17 and continue to do its \nstatutory duty to protect the public?”\n  The Law Center’s clients charge \nthat the NRC has not met its duty \nto protect the public by permitting \nHRI to mine for uranium in the \ncommunity aquifer. The NRC stated \nHRI would be mining in the part of \nthe aquifer that is already naturally \ncontaminated by uranium and is not \ndrinking water. HRI also argued that \nthe mining would be in a part of the \naquifer that is contained, but with \nfurther prodding from the judges, \nHRI stated the portion of the aquifer \nthat would be mined was vertically \nconfined but not horizontally \nconfined. To that, Judge Carlos Lucero \nresponded, “I do not understand it. \nIf it’s just vertically confined and \nnot horizontally confined, what’s to \nkeep this water from flowing into \nthe municipal drinking water?”  In \nfurther questioning, Eric responded \nthat the mining would also take place \n¼ mile from the municipal water \nsupply well. In response, Judge David \nM. Ebel said “I can’t even begin to \nunderstand that.”  \n   After 12 years of fighting to stop \nHRI’s plans of uranium mining, and \nmonths of work by the legal team \n(including Diane Curran of Harmon, \nCurran, Spielberg & Eisenberg, L.L.P. \nand Zackeree Kelin of DNA-People’s \nLegal Services, Inc.), the two opposing \nparties were scheduled only 30 \nminutes total to state their case and \nanswer questions from the panel of \njudges. But, due to the number of \nquestions from the judges and the \ndepth of their interest in the issue, the \nhearing took an hour. The judges were \nobviously astonished as to how these \npermits could have been granted. \nEric’s presentation was confident, \nclear and relaxed, which attests to the \n  nmenvirolaw.org       1 \nContents\nCase Updates:.......

Oil pits hold wastes from \noil and gas wells, which can include \ncarcinogens such as benzene, \ntoluene, ethylbenzene and xylene – \na resounding victory for our state’s \nwater, wildlife and human health.  \n    Here are some of the new \nrequirements:\n• For the first time, all pits must \nbe lined with heavy-duty liners, \nunless issued a special exemption.        \n• When groundwater is less than 50 \nfeet from the pit, companies must \nuse “closed-loop systems” (above \nground tanks) rather than pits.\n• Waste can no longer be spread \nonsite, but must be sent to an \napproved landfill. The pit must \nbe reclaimed unless the site is \nspecifically exempted.\n    In December, Oil Conservation \nDivision (OCD) Director Mark \nFesmire told the Santa Fe New \nMexican that in the past 15 years \nthe OCD had investigated 800 \ninstances of oil and gas well-related \ncontamination, roughly half were \ndue to oil pits.  He expects that with \nthis new rule that contamination \nwill “drop down to nothing.”\n    “It’s a good rule,” affirms Law \nCenter Staff Attorney Eric Jantz.  \n“For a relatively small investment, \nthere will be a significant positive \nimpact on the environment.”\n    This summer, industry groups \nsued to overturn the new rule.

Although Tyrone \nessentially admits that regrading and \ncovering would prevent acid rock \ndrainage from further contaminating \ngroundwater, Tyrone officials insist \nthat the groundwater under the \nmine is not “a place of withdrawal \nof water for present or reasonably \nforeseeable future use” and thus \nis not protected under the state’s \nWQA.  The Law Center and its client, \nthe Silver City-based environmental \nadvocacy group Gila Resources \nInformation Project (GRIP), counter \nthat the Tyrone mine overlies a \nvaluable groundwater supply, and \ntherefore, the affected aquifers \nqualify as “places of withdrawal” and \nmust be protected under the WQA.\n    On July 7, 2008 the WQCC heard \nclosing oral arguments from the New \nMexico Environment Department \n(NMED), Tyrone and GRIP.  “Each \nparty was granted one hour to \npresent to the Commission,” recalls \nBruce Frederick, Law Center \nattorney for GRIP. “We supported \nNMED’s arguments and also gave \nthe Commission legal argument \nand additional evidence that went \nbeyond NMED’s theory of the case.”\n    If the WQCC rules in favor of \nTyrone, it would potentially be \nauthorizing the company and \nother polluters to use the state’s \nprecious groundwater as a dump.\n    We do not expect a decision \nbefore the end of the year.  \n“W\nhat happens if plutonium \ngets into the water supply?”  \nOur clients, Amigos Bravos and \nConcerned Citizens for Nuclear \nSafety are not saying that will \nhappen, but strongly believe that \nthe potential for the Project to divert \ncontamination from Los Alamos \nNational Lab (LANL) should be fully \nand publicly discussed and analyzed \nbefore the Project goes forward. \n    The Law Center became involved \nafter the Forest Service (FS) and \nBureau of Land Management \n(BLM) decided to issue permits and \nrights-of-way for the \nProject in February \n2008.                        \nby Allyson Siwik, Executive Director of GRIP\n A month later, the Law Center filed \nan administrative appeal of their \ndecisions to the FS and the Interior \nBoard of Land Appeals, respectively, \narguing that the agencies violated \nthe National Environmental Policy \nAct (NEPA) by failing to disclose and \nadequately analyze the impact of \nLANL-origin contaminants on the \nProject in an environmental impact \nstatement (EIS).   LANL is a major \nsource of radiological, hazardous \nand toxic contamination, and the \nProject will take water out of the \nRio Grande downstream from this \nsource.  The EIS prepared by the \nagencies dismissed the \nprospect of LANL \ncontamination as “speculative” and \nomitted to even identify LANL on a \nsite map. \n    Notwithstanding the overwhelming \nevidence showing LANL-origin \ncontaminants have reached the River\nand will likely continue to reach \nthe River at the Project’s place of \ndiversion, both federal agencies \nsummarily dismissed the appeals.  \nThe agencies’ decisions may now be \nappealed to Federal District Court \nand the Law Center and its clients are \nevaluating this option. \nBuckman Pollution Appeal Dismissed\n  \n1990\n Successfully reduces \ntwo timber sales in the Gila \nNational Forest \n1991\n Works with State \nEnvironmental Improvement \nBoard to adopt new regulations \nrequired by the NM Solid Waste Act\n1992\n Helps the Mining Action \nCoalition to regulate mining \nof hard rock minerals in           \nNew Mexico \nTyrone reclamation near Silver City, NM\nby Bruce Frederick\n\nAnniversary Series\n      4      Celebrating Twenty Years of Environmental and Community Victories    \nM\nining is one of the most toxic \nindustries in the West.  Despite \nthat, before 1993 New Mexico had no \nlaw requiring reclamation of hard \nrock mines. The enactment of the \nNew Mexico Mining Act changed that \ndramatically; it is in many ways the \nmost stringent mining law in the \nWest. \n    The Act governs extraction of \nhardrock minerals, including copper, \ngold, silver, and molybdenum; it also \ncovers mining of uranium from open \npit mines and underground mines.  \n(In situ leach uranium mining is \ngoverned by the federal Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission.)  The Act \nwas the culmination of a three year \neffort by then State Representative \nGary King (now New Mexico’s \nAttorney General), whose district \nincluded a gold mine in the Ortiz \nMountains that had polluted both \nsurface and ground water.    \n    Rep. King’s first two efforts to \npass mining legislation did not \nsucceed.  “The 1993 legislative \nsession involved a more determined \neffort by King and by environmental \nand industry groups to address \nhardrock mining,” remembers \nDouglas Meiklejohn, one of the lead \nenvironmental lobbyists for the \nAct.  He recalls that three mining \nbills were introduced that year:  \nRep. King’s bill, a bill drafted by \nenvironmental groups, and a bill \nbacked by the mining industry.\nThe three bills were the subject of \nextensive legislative committee \nhearings and negotiations by all \ninterested parties.  Ultimately, a \nversion of King’s bill was enacted.  \n“There were a lot of people \ninvolved,” recalls Meiklejohn, “but \nthere were only a few of us left when \nwe agreed on the final version, at \ntwo in the morning on a Monday late \nin the session.” \n    The Act includes mandates that \nnew mines be planned to provide for \nreclamation, and be reclaimed to self-\nsustaining ecosystems compatible \nwith surrounding life zones.

(HRI) had been granted a \nlicense by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission to mine uranium in \nthe Church Rock-Crownpoint area. It \nwas a headline that alarmed Mitchell \nCapitan, a Crownpoint resident \nwho had worked at the MobilOil \npilot-scale in situ leach uranium \nmine near his home, and who had \nwatched as the federal government \nallowed the company to abandon \nthe site after it failed for six years to \nclean up the groundwater.  Later  \n    \n  that year, Mitchell and \nhis wife Rita formed \nEastern Navajo \nDiné Against Uranium Mining \n(ENDAUM) in order to protect their \ncommunity from the devastation \nof another uranium boom. As the \norganization grew, Larry King was \nasked to join the board of ENDAUM \nand has been serving since 1997.\n    King, a Church Rock resident \nand rancher, also knows firsthand \nthe effects of uranium mining \non communities. He spent seven \nyears working for an underground \nuranium mining company and \nrecalls the 100 million gallons of \nradioactive water that spilled into \nthe Rio Puerco in 1979. This spill  \n    occurred the same year as \nthe Three Mile Island \nnuclear accident \nand was a larger \ncontamination \nevent, but re-\nceived little press. \nCurrently, King \nlives 1,000 feet \nfrom a uranium \ntailings pile. \n“When the winds \nshift, we get some dust off of that \npile,” he says. \n    Looking back on the work that \nENDAUM has done in the Navajo \ncommunity, he says, “There are a \nlot of good people out there who are \nwilling to assist a grassroots \n    organization.

It \nwas a true compliment from two \nchampions of New Mexico’s public \nlands, who fought for rangeland \nreform, riparian enhancement, \nwildlife protection and wilderness \ndesignations.  \n    Their passion for protection led \nthem to the Law Center in 1993 \nwhen they successfully worked \nwith the Coalition of Conservation \nOrganizations in Las Cruces to \nprevent construction of the Kenzin \ngas pipeline and several water \ntroughs for cattle on a Bureau of \nLand Management (BLM) allotment \nthat was located within a wilderness \nstudy area.  That year, the Law \nCenter also represented Tom in his \nsuccessful effort to be designated as \nan affected interest regarding the \nFlying W grazing allotment in the \nMimbres Resource Area.  \n    “I was relatively new to the \nenvironmental movement when we \ntook on the Kenzin Pipeline work,” \nremembers Tom. “I remember this \nwas the first time I was introduced \nto lawyers who worked pro bono \nfor environmental groups.  It was \nabsolutely wonderful to have \nsomeone of Doug Meiklejohn’s \nstature working for us.” \n    Since that time, the Wootten \nfamily has generously supprted \nthe Law Center’s work, despite \nthe fact that we now work more \nclosely on community-centered \ncases than public lands cases.  Three \ncases of particular interest to Tom \nwere the Sunland Park landfill and \nincinerator case near Las Cruces, \nthe Cunningham Hill gold mine \nin Santa Fe County, and the Dog \nCanyon landfill near Alamogordo.  \nThe connective tissue between \nthese cases was the Law Center’s \nwork to stop entities from profiting \noff of the land to the detriment of \ncommunities – both human and \nnatural – that depend upon that land.  \n    “Although my first love is \nNew Mexico wild lands, I can’t \nunderestimate the importance of \ncommunity issues,” Tom said.  “It \nprovides a great deal of comfort to \nme that the dollars that I give to the \nLaw Center go to important fights \nthat I can’t fight personally,” such \nas the Sunland Park case where \nlow-income kids were breathing in \nthe smoke from a medical waste \nincinerator sited a short distance \naway from their elementary school.\n    Tom added that although he \nbelieves that concerned citizens \nshould have the right to participate \nin governmental proceedings that \nSpring Member Events  in Roswell and Silver City\nAllyson Siwik, Executive Director of GRIP , \n     Doug Meiklejohn and \n Eleanor Wootten at \nSilver City event.                  \n         \nFormer Law Center attorney, Doug Wolf \nspeaking at Silver City event.\nJuana Colon, Doug Meiklejohn, co-host \nJimi Gadzia and Sebia Hawkins \nat Roswell Member event.\nThomas and Eleanor Wootten\nAnniversary Series\n1996\n Forces Governor Gary \nJohnson to withdraw an \nexecutive order to override  \nthe New Mexico Mining Act \n1997\n First Community \nEnvironmental Advocacy \nAward given to those that work \nfor environmental justice\n1998\n First Griff Salisbury \nEnvironmental Award given \nto honor those protecting \nNew Mexico’s environment \nby Shelbie Knox\nStory Continued on page 13>\n\n“ I ’ve always said that tailings ponds were like diapers; they can only \n            hold so much before you have a big mess on your hands.”\nB\nrian Shields, Executive Director \nof Amigos Bravos, and I were \nhip-deep into our interview about \nMolycorp when I had to hang up \nto change my daughter’s diaper.  \nApologizing after I called him back, \nhe laughed and said, “I’ve always said \nthat tailings ponds were like diapers; \nthey can only hold so much before \nyou have a big mess on your hands.”\n    Brian’s quick comeback sums \nup my experience with the folks \nat Amigos Bravos, a non-profit \nRio Grande watershed advocacy \norganization based in Taos:  they are \nable to distill their highly technical \nknowledge of the Rio Grande \nwatershed into language that even \nsomeone drenched in spit-up can \nunderstand.  It is a talent that has \nserved the Law Center well, as we \nhave represented Amigos Bravos on \nseveral highly technical cases, the \ncrown jewel of which has been our \nwork on the Molycorp molybdenum \nmine near Questa, north of Taos.\n            \n   Flying over the Sangre de Cristo \nrange, your eyes are immediately \ndrawn to a pit that was carved into \nthe mountainside over the course \nof twenty years. From the air you \ncan also see more than 300 million \ntons of waste rock that tower over \nthe town of Questa, as well as the \nRed River, a tiny ribbon glinting \nsilver at the base of the mountain. \n    It is not until you are standing \nnext to the river, that you \nrealize that it is a \ndead stream \nAmigos Bravos’ Brian Sheilds\nthe closeout plan, and I remember \nthat Doug was really incredible in the \nhearings.  After Moly realized that we \nhad counsel and experts, they came \nback to the table with a financial \nsurety offer of $50 million.  By the \nend of the hearing, they offered $90 \nmillion. Doug managed to get us into \nnegotiations with the State and the \ncompany, and we walked away with \na total of $157 million in reclamation \nbonds for both the minesite and the \ntailings piles.” Until the Law Center’s \nsuccess several years later with the \nPhelps Dodge copper mines, this was \nthe largest financial bond ever posted \nby a mining company.  In addition, \nthe company is required to reclaim \nthe site to a self-sustaining ecosystem \nonce the mine is closed.  While the \nMolycorp reclamation chickens \nare not yet hatched, progress is \nbeing made towards the eventual \nreclamation of the Molycorp mine–\nand the rescue of the Red River.\n    Brian has never counted up \nthe hours, but he \nbelieves that the Law \nCenter’s representation on the \nMolycorp proceedings alone would \nhave cost the organization at least \na half-million dollars.  And while \nthe Law Center’s free and low-cost \nlegal services are important for \nhis non-profit group, he says that \nAmigos Bravos also relies on the \nLaw Center’s expertise, experience \nand willingness to join them in \ntaking on some of the \n      6      Celebrating Twenty Years of Environmental and Community Victories  \nAnniversary Series\nby Shelbie Knox\n1999\n NM Court rules for Law \nCenter’s client, the Sierra \nClub, throwing out the permit \nfor the El Cajete mine\n2001\nNRC overturns a decision \nthat allowed Hydro \nResources to litigate each \nproposed minesite separately\n2000\n Protests with ENDAUM and \nallies, at Uranium Resources, \nInc.’s Dallas office.

As one of the first \nmajor tests of the 1993 Mining Act, \nthe Molycorp case was headed up \nby the Law Center Staff Attorney \nDoug Wolf. “We had dual goals,” \nremembers Brian.  “We wanted to \nprotect surface and ground water, \nwhile at the same time implementing \nthe Mining Act as one of the most \nstringent laws of its kind in the \nU.S.”  The permitting proceedings \nthat began in 1999 marked the first \ntime that the NM Environment \nDepartment had regulated the \nmine in its 80 years of operation.\n    Brian remembers the Closeout \nand Reclamation plan battle against \nMolycorp well.  “Moly (Molycorp) \nfirst came in with an offer of $15 \nmillion for financial assurance \n(the amount of money that a \ncompany must guarantee the State \nif the company is ever unable to \nperform reclamation.)  At that point \nwe worked with Doug and our \nmining engineer, Jim Kuipers, to \nput together our own reclamation \nplan, which put a $400 million \nprice tag on cleanup at the mine.\n    “We went into the \npublic hearings on \n\n  nmenvirolaw.org       7\nAnniversary Series\nT\nhinking about his fourteen years \nas a Law Center Board Member, \nFrank I.

But the achievement \nhe is most proud of is the Navajo \nNation’s and Law Center’s roles \nin getting the moratorium on \nuranium mining passed in 2005. \n“We worked with many partners to \nsuccessfully advocate for a law with \nwide impact.

The bill passed handily \nwith the vote of 244 to 166.  \n    The bill strives to protect crucial \ndrinking water supplies and \nother natural resources, special \nplaces, taxpayers, fish and wildlife \nhabitat, and the health and well \nbeing of our communities.  The \nbill charges a royalty for the first \ntime ever and allows our federal \nland managers to balance mining \nwith other land uses.  The bill \nfinally puts hardrock mining on \npar with other extractive industries \nlike oil, gas, and coal mining.\n    Reform is long overdue.  The \n1872 Mining Law was signed into \nlaw on May 10, 1872 to encourage \ndevelopment of the West and to \nsettle land disputes.  The law governs \nhardrock mining on \n270 million acres \n      8     Celebrating Twenty Years of Environmental and Community Victories  \nNews\n2005 \nSuccessfully advocates \npassage of the Diné Natural \nResources Protection Act, \nbanning uranium mining in \nNavajo Indian Country\n2007\n Files landmark federal \nlawsuit after NRC validates \nHydro Resources’ nuclear \nsource materials license\n2006\n Achieves nearly every \ngoal the Gila Resources and \nInformation Center sought for \nthe Phelps Dodge T yrone permit \nof publically owned lands \nmostly in the West.  This \nconstitutes almost one-\nfourth of all the land in \nthe United States, or two-\nthirds of the public lands \nowned by all Americans.\n    While modern mines \nhave massive environmental \nfootprints, use chemicals \nsuch as cyanide and sulfuric \nacid, and generate huge \nquantities of waste, the 1872 \nMining Law has no environmental \nprovisions.  Mining has left an \nugly environmental and taxpayer \nlegacy, with 40% of the headwaters \nof western watersheds polluted and \na clean-up bill of over $50 billion.  \nAlthough a temporary moratorium \ncurrently halts the sale of public \nlands (under the law, land can be \npatented – or privatized – for as \nlittle as $2.50 per acre), $245 billion \nworth of mineral bearing public \nlands have been “sold” to mining \ncompanies under the law – a land \narea the same size as Connecticut.\n    Enactment of a mining law \nreform bill would be a giant step \ntowards dealing with mining’s \ntoxic legacy preventing new mining \npollution and bringing mining on \npublic lands into the 21st century.  \n    However, if it is to have a chance \nat becoming law, it must pass the \nSenate.

Experts included \nBen Alexander, socio-economist at \nHeadwaters Economics in Montana; \nLance Astrella, oil and gas attorney \nfrom Denver who represents \nindividuals and municipalities; \nTweeti Blancett, a San Juan County \nrancher; and Dr. Theo Colborn, an \nenvironmental health analyst.  The \nexperts addressed public health \nissues, comparative economics of \noil and gas development, and legal \nstrategies and issues that could \nfurther inform the local Galisteo \nBasin debate as the community \nand county continue the process of \ndeveloping an ordinance for Santa \nFe County.  \n    The Law Center along with \nCommon Ground United* and \nConservation Voters New Mexico \nhosted a public education meeting \nin the evening with these same \nexperts (except Tweeti Blancett). \nThe meeting entitled “Everything \nyou wanted to know about Oil \nand Gas but Were Afraid to Ask” \nwas moderated by Sandy Buffett, \nDirector of Conservation Voters New \nMexico. The Unitarian Universalist \nChurch was packed with well over \n100 people who came to learn \nmore about other western states’ \nexperiences that could apply to \nSanta Fe county and inform the \nordinance framework and drafting \nprocess.   The bottom line is that \ncitizens must continue to demand \nfull accountability, transparency \nand participation in the regulatory \nprocess, and we must take control of \nthe information about this industry \nand disseminate it broadly in public \neducation campaigns. Objective \nbaseline studies \nare conducted by \nboth state agencies \nand independent \nexperts in order to \nhave data of what \nwas present before \nany drilling occurs. \nThese baseline \nstudies should \naddress a range of \nconcerns including \neconomics, public \nhealth, air and \nwater quality and \nbiological and \ncultural resource \nimpacts.\n    The biggest news \nis that oil and gas \ndevelopment is not the economic \nemployment engine it was forty \nyears ago in the West as employment \nnumbers have nearly flat-lined for \nthe past thirty years while many \nother economic sectors have greatly \noutpaced mining development in \nthe state.  However, numbers are \nnot available for the actual costs to \nNew Mexico in lost land use due to \noil and gas waste contamination; \nlost employment for ranchers; lost \nwater resources; public health costs \nof increased respiratory illnesses \nand other associated afflictions. \nFinally, it is up to local communities \nand their county governments to \ndetermine whether oil and gas \ndevelopment in the Rocky Mountain \nWest is compatible with the new \nincreasingly diverse economies that \ndepend on quality of life and pristine \nenvironments to bring economic \ngrowth to our region.\n    The Law Center is grateful to \nthe New Mexico Association of \nGrantmakers for its interest in \nfurther educating its members about \nthis most important issue; and, to \nJan Brooks for her efforts to organize \nboth the funders’ forum and public \neducation event.

David Ulibarri, would \nhave imposed a small tax on new \nuranium mines in New Mexico that \nwould contribute to an “abandoned \nuranium mine reclamation fund.” \nIn theory, the bill provided for clean \nup of old uranium mines but in \nfact it would have provided very \nlittle funds. In its final form, the tax \ncollected would have provided, over \napproximately 20-30 years, enough \nfunds to clean 1 or 2 abandoned \nmines; currently there are hundreds \nof abandoned uranium mines in \nNew Mexico. The bill also would \nnot have authorized the state to \nrecover the costs of clean up from \nthe owner of the abandoned mine, \nif that owner was still a functioning \ncompany. \n    The bill passed the House and, \nwith amendments, passed the \nSenate. The Law Center, along \nwith many other environmental \nand community organizations, \nrallied public support to ask \nGovernor Richardson to veto the \nbill. Thankfully, he did on March \n3rd, reporting to the press that New \nMexico “deserves better.” \n   Thanks to all of our members for \ntheir phone calls and emails!\n                                  \n Restrictive Impact Statements  \n for Rule Makers Avoided\nHB #310, Regulatory Impact \nStatement Requirements, \nsponsored by Representative \nRichard Berry, would have \nrequired state agencies to prepare \nregulatory impact statements \nwhen they proposed to adopt \nnew regulations. This bill would \nhave significantly slowed down \nagencies’ ability to adopt new \nregulations in order to protect \ncommunities or the environment. \nThe Law Center, with other \nenvironmental groups, negotiated \nwith Rep. Berry, and although \nsubstantial progress was made, \nnegotiations did not result in an \nagreement. Rep.

The industrial \neconomy is an artifact of cheap oil. \nThere will be a transition from an \nindustrial to an ecological economy. \nIt will either be very chaotic and \ndestructive to human systems, \nespecially the poorest of the poor, \nor it might be a social evolution to a \nhealthier, more equitable and more \nreliably prosperous knowledge-\nbased economy...The key is to find \nways to release the energy of people \nin place. The only truly unlimited \nand untapped resource left in a \nworld of increasing scarcity is the \ninfinite creativity of the human \nimagination. Imagination, with even \nthe slightest nod of encouragement \nand a little money, enables even \nthe least advantaged among us to \nimprove their lives in the places they \nlive.

It would be great if we could \nhelp every one of them. But the \nreality is we have to make choices: \nThe New Mexico Environmental Law \nCenter is one of mine.  \n    Saving the planet involves \ngreat paradigm shifts and energy \nof all kinds, especially human \nenergy. It’s imperative we think \nglobally–and act locally: Buying \nlocally contributes to New Mexico’s \neconomy and environment.                                        \nIt preserves local agriculture and \nreduces our carbon footprint. \nMoney spent with local business \ncirculates in our economy at three \ntimes the rate of money spent at \nnationally owned businesses. And \njust as patronizing local business \ndoes three times as much good \nfor our community, economically,  \nmoney spent in the local progressive \nbusiness community does the same, \nit circulates in the local progressive \ncommunity.\n    When I’m deciding whom to give \nmy business or my support to, I keep \nthis in mind. The NMELC has a long, \nsuccessful track record of protecting \nour environment. But the Center \nneeds funding to continue the vital \nwork it does for New Mexicans. \nThat’s why Lakind Dental Group \nwill donate half the cost of your new \npatient exam to the NMELC. If you’re \na local progressive, I hope you will \ntake us up on this offer. It’s a great \nway to put your money where your \nmouth is. \n\nNews  (continued)\naffect their communities, he knew \nthat in practice, public participation \ncan be a difficult thing to achieve. \n“Decision-makers have a much \ntougher time dismissing a good \nattorney armed with technical facts \nand legal arguments,” he conceded.  \n“In the Flying W case, I was twice \ndenied ‘affected interest’ status by \nthe BLM.  Only with the positive \nintervention of the Law Center \nwas I finally able to participate \nin a proceeding that was, by law, \nsupposed to be open to the public.”  \nHe then went on to say that this \nproblem is compounded in poor \ncommunities where residents are \nperpetually abused by corporations \nand the government. \n    From the Woottens’ experience, \nthe Law Center’s highest value is \nopening the door for citizens to \nparticipate, whether or not they have \nmoney or political power, and it is \nwhy Eleanor continues to support \nthe Law Center.  The Law Center \nthanks the Wootten family for their \nfinancial and moral support for the \npast fifteen years. \n<Wooten Story from page 5\n  nmenvirolaw.org       13\nBoard of Director s\nDale Pontius, President, Santa Fe \nSusanne Hoffman-Dooley, VP, Santa Fe \nDavid Henderson, Secretary, Santa Fe \nRobby Rodriguez, Treasurer, Albuquerque \nMyron Armijo, Albuquerque\nStuart Bluestone, Santa Fe\nDiana Bustamante, La Mesa \nJeanie Cragin, Maxwell \nDonna House, Alcalde \nRenee Ingold, Cerrillos \nPablo Padilla, Jr., Zuni Pueblo \nCorrine Sanchez, San Ildefonso Pueblo \nFrank Sanchez, Roswell \nPeter Stacey, Santa Fe\nStaff\nJuana Colón, Communications and Public \nEducation Associate\nBruce Frederick, Staff Attorney\nSebia Hawkins, Director of Development\nEric Jantz, Staff Attorney\nShelbie Knox, Development Officer\nDouglas Meiklejohn, Executive Director\nYana Merrill, Director of Finance & \nAdministration\nContact Information\n1405 Luisa Street, Ste. 5 \nSanta Fe, NM  87505\n505.989.9022 telephone | 505.989.3769 fax\nnmelc@nmelc.org general email or to \nsubscribe to an electronic version of the \nGFR   www.nmenvirolaw.org\nrequires the same for existing mines, \nbut provides that reclamation may \nbe waived if it would be technically \nor economically unfeasible, or \nenvironmentally unsound.

One involved the \ncompany’s attempt to purchase \nwater rights from southern New \nMexico while the other was a long-\nstanding fight to force the plant to \nclean up its toxic air emissions.  In \nthe former case, Law Center Staff \nAttorney Doug Wolf represented \nSWOP in a victorious effort to \nprevent the company \nfrom purchasing \n$1.5 million in \nwater rights from farmers near \nSocorro.  The ruling stymied the \ncompany’s attempt to use the \nrights to offset 4 million gallons of \ngroundwater used at the Rio Rancho \nplant every day. \n   Unfortunately, SWOP and the \nLaw Center were not so successful \nin forcing the company to clean up \nits air emissions.  But Rodriguez, \nwho cut his teeth as a college intern \nworking for SWOP at the Intel \nhearings, maintains that taking on \nthe fight was important in its own \nright.  “It’s important to win these \nbattles because human health and \nthe health of the environment are \nat stake.

It is a vital resource to \nfarmers, ranchers, students and \neducators, businesspeople, artists, \nspiritual and religious leaders, \nsportsmen, outdoor enthusiasts, \nand community and conservation \ngroups. In accord with inherent \nbeauty, ecological value, and \nauthority of Santa Fe County, we \nbelieve the following:\n1. The watersheds of the \nGalisteo Basin are of \nparamount value and its \nwaters the lifeblood of the \nland’s wildlife and our \nhealthy communities;\n2. The Galisteo Basin is a vital \nresource to a sustainable \nfuture for central New \nMexico’s cultural, rural and \nagricultural communities;\n3. The Galisteo Basin provides \nunique recreational and \nsporting opportunities \nfor families, hunters, \nanglers, and other outdoor \nenthusiasts;\n      8     Celebrating T wenty Years of Environmental and Community Victories  nmenvirolaw.org \nNews\n2005\nHelps obtain NM Supreme \nCourt ruling: community \nconcerns must be considered \nduring NMED landfill proceedings \n2007\nSuccessfully lobbies for the \nmost stringent law in the \nnation to protect landowners \nfrom oil and gas degradation\n2006\nForces Los Alamos Lab to \ncancel 2 permits to openly \nburn explosives, depleted \nuranium and other chemicals\n4.

The Galisteo Basin should \nbe protected for the benefit \nof the people – all of the \npeople.\nBased on these values, we believe \nthat it is a grave mistake to exploit \nthese special lands for the principal \nbenefit of the fossil fuel industry. \nOil and gas development poses \nfundamental threats to the water, \nwildlife and cultural values of \nthe Galisteo Basin as well as to \nthe public health of communities \nthroughout the region.

Many say that \nnuclear power is the key to our energy \nfuture and limiting global warming.  \nNevertheless, before we jump to conclu-\nsions, let’s take a closer look at the new \nwave of nuclear power plants so strongly \nadvocated by many in Congress, a hand-\nful of conservationists, and much of the \nwell-meaning public. Th is will help us to \nbetter understand the potential impact \nof nuclear power plants on America’s, \nand for that matter, the world’s energy \nfuture.\nThe Money Pit\nFor more than 50 years, the nuclear \nindustry has been heavily subsidized by \nyour federal tax dollars to a tune of $66 billion for research and development alone.  Yet \ntoday no construction can occur without massive federal subsidies.

(HRI) by the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission (NRC).  \n“T ó eii be’iiná át’é – ‘Water is life,’” \nstated Lynnea Smith, Executive Director of \nENDAUM, when the suit was ﬁ led.  “Th e \nNRC has ignored our communities for more \nthan a decade as we have fought to protect \nthe resource that is most important to us.  \nHave no doubt about it – we will continue \nto ﬁ ght for the purity of our water for gen-\nerations to come.” \nTh e petition for review, ﬁ led in the U.S. \nT enth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, \nasks the Court to review numerous decisions \nphotographer: Manciblue | agency: dreamstime.com\n\nissued by the NRC during the past ten years.  Lead attorney Eric \nJantz argues that the Agency violated the Atomic Energy Act, the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, and its own regulations when \nit issued decisions on numerous issues.  \nOutlining details of the case, Jantz explains that the Agency issued \na license to the mining company despite the fact that the company \nfailed to prove that it would\nprotect groundwater from contamination by uranium and \nother heavy metals — even though the water is the sole \nsource of drinking water for nearly 15,000 residents;\nensure that the health of residents near the mines would \nbe protected from damaging radiological air emissions, \ndespite the fact that the area already exceeds federal radio-\nactivity standards due to past mining contamination;\npost an adequate bond to ensure that the site would be \ncleaned up in the event that the company is unable to \nreclaim the land or water impacted by the mining — al-\nthough no mine of this type has ever been reclaimed to \nbaseline levels.\nJantz continues, “Our clients stand a much better chance of pro-\ntecting Navajo communities from unsafe uranium mining in fed-\neral court, which is unburdened by the pro-industry bias exhibited \nby the NRC.”\nTh is case should be completely briefed by late summer.  We expect \na decision from the Court in 2008.\n— Staﬀ  Attorney Eric Jantz\nNavajo communities win victory in \nfront of E.P.A.\nOn February 6, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nand the U.S. Department of the Interior determined that HRI’s \nChurch Rock Section 8 property is Indian Country for the pur-\nposes of enforcing the Safe Drinking Water Act.  \nUranium Ban Will Apply\nTh is important decision places jurisdiction to enforce the Drink-\ning Water Act with the Federal government or the Navajo Nation.  \nSigniﬁ cantly, this determination of Indian Country means that the \nDiné Natural Resources Protection Act applies to this parcel of land \nand uranium mining and processing is therefore prohibited \nunder Navajo law.  \nUnfortunately this issue is not yet over.  In March, HRI appealed \nthe EPA decision to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.  Th e Law \nCenter’s clients intend to ﬁ le a friend of the court brief with the \nCourt of Appeals urging that the EPA’s determination be upheld.  \n— Staﬀ  Attorney Eric Jantz\n\n\n\nLaw Center prepares for \nPrecedent-setting landfill hearing  \nWith a population of only 6,300 people, the colonia of Chapar-\nral is home to two landﬁ lls, a sewage reclamation plant, a sewage \nsludge disposal site, a sand and gravel operation, a hazardous waste \ncontainer storage facility, an electric power plant and a natural gas \nplant.  Rhino Environmental Services is seeking to build another \nlandﬁ ll in Chaparral, less than half a mile from homes.\nPublic T estimony is ‘Irrelevant’\nIn September 2001, hundreds of the town’s residents packed \nthe middle school auditorium for several nights to participate in \nthe public hearing.  Many testiﬁ ed about negative impacts that \nthey feared would accompany the dump, including groundwater \ncontamination, air pollution and health impacts.  Resident Jim See \ntestiﬁ ed to another concern voiced by many residents, “Haven’t we \ndone our part?  Why another dump?  I ask this question, is this \nreally a case of gouging a large hole [in] Chaparral’s backyard for \na dump, because the people happen to be poor, hard working and \nunable to ﬁ nancially ﬁ ght such a development?”\nT o their shock, the New Mexico Environment Department \n(NMED) Hearing Oﬃ  cer stated during the proceeding that their \nnon-technical testimony was “irrelevant” to the Agency’s decision.  \nTh e NMED then proceeded to issue the permit to the landﬁ ll \ncompany.\nCommunity Wins Landmark Decision\nOutraged by the State’s open disregard for overwhelming public \nopposition to the landﬁ ll, the Colonias Development Council \n(CDC) appealed the decision, ultimately arguing its case before \nthe New Mexico Supreme Court.  With help from Law Center at-\ntorneys, the CDC emerged with a precedent-setting decision from \nthe Supreme Court justices in 2005.  In their decision, the justices \nstated that “Th e [Environment] Department’s review must include \n“Th e NRC has ignored our communities for \nmore than a decade as we have fought to \nprotect the resource that is most important to \nus.

It was the ﬁ rst appeal ever ﬁ led to the \nAlbuquerque/Bernalillo County Air Quality Control \nBoard.\nNot One Neighbor in Favor\nIn addition to the technical witnesses presented by our \nclients at hearings in May 2006 and January 2007, \nforty-seven community members spoke out against the \nfacility during the public comment periods of the May \nhearing. Not one community member spoke in favor \nof the facility. \nOn March 14, 2007 the Board met, deliberated and \ndecided to narrowly modify Vulcan’s permit, requiring \nwheel washes on the haul roads into and out of the facil-\nity. Unfortunately, it was far removed from the goal of \nour clients, who had argued for a denial of the permit.  \nTh e Board also disregarded our clients’ requests for \nmany other conditions to the permit, including reduced \noperating hours and additional monitoring and report-\ning requirements. \nOne Bright Spot\nOne bright spot in this case was our success in reduc-\ning the fee to ﬁ le an appeal with the \nBoard.  Originally charged $1,000 \nto challenge the permit, the Board \nultimately refunded the fee when our \nclients showed that it was a ﬁ nancial \nhardship.  Th anks to our eﬀ orts, \nthe regulations have been changed, \nand the fee for an appeal has been \nlowered to $150.\nTh e Law Center’s clients continue to oppose the con-\nstruction of the Vulcan concrete batch plant across the \nstreet from their community center, and are considering \ntheir future steps and strategies.  \n— Staﬀ  Attorney Sarah Piltch\nconsideration of public testimony about the proposed landﬁ ll’s adverse \nimpact on a community’s quality of life.”  Th is is the ﬁ rst decision in New \nMexico aﬃ  rming that quality of life must be taken into account when the \nEnvironment Department considers the issuance of a permit.\nIn addition, the Court ordered that the Environment \nDepartment reopen the public testimony portion of \nthe hearing.  Law Center Director Douglas Meiklejohn \nis representing the CDC as it prepares for the hearing \nthis summer.  Th is hearing is particularly important \nbecause it is the ﬁ rst test of the Environment Depart-\nment under the Supreme Court’s new interpretation of \nthe NM Solid Waste Act.  We will be ﬁ ghting hard to \nensure that the State seriously considers public testimony \nbefore reissuing its decision on the Rhino permit, since its process will not \nonly aﬀ ect the residents of Chaparral, but also all solid waste permitting \ndecisions in the State for years to come.\n— Development Oﬃ  cer Shelbie Knox \nLaw Center Docket 2006-2007\n*denotes cases closed in 2006 | **denotes cases closed in 2007\nFor more cases and the latest updates, check out  www.nmenvirolaw.org/news.\n    \n 3\n\n\nnon-military nuclear facilities constructed in the United States before 2026.  Th e Act establishes a no \nfault insurance-type system in which the ﬁ rst $10 billion is industry-funded, should an accident occur, \nbut any claims above that ﬁ gure would be paid by the federal government.  Sandia Laboratory calcu-\nlated in 2004 that the cost of a serious nuclear plant accident would likely run $600 billion or more.\nIn the 2005 Energy Bill, according to the non-proﬁ t group Public Citizen, the nuclear industry \nwas the clear winner, raking in more than $12 billion in subsidies.  Th is includes tax credits for each \nkilowatt-hour of nuclear generated energy produced from new reactors during the ﬁ rst eight years of \noperation. It is project that this will cost the US T reasury more than $5.7 billion in lost revenue.  Th e \nbill also authorized a $2 billion “risk insurance” to pay industry for any delays in construction of new \npower plants.  T o compare, the oil and gas industry received about $6 billion in subsidies, while the \ncoal industry got $9 billion.  However, it is clear that it isn’t solely building nuclear plants that required \nsubsidies, but also keeping them in operation.  \nMining, refining and the realities of global warming\nMany have argued that nuclear power is the key to stopping global warming because nuclear power \ndoes not generate carbon dioxide and it slows the consumption of fossil fuels.  Nevertheless, there are \nsome serious problems with this hypothesis.  First, the cost of nuclear power is simply not viable or \nsustainable.\nSecond, any major expansion of nuclear power would require a complementary development of ura-\nnium mining.  Th is would quickly deplete the supply of high-grade ores, in turn causing tremendous \npressure to mine uranium wherever it could be found.  Th is could lead to potentially disastrous envi-\nronmental impacts from in-situ leach mining (aka pumping chemical solutions into the ground to force \nout uranium-rich solutions).  Th is type of mining presents a major threat to various aquifers, including \nthose in New Mexico.  With uranium prices eclipsing $62.50 a pound [editor’s note -- since this article \noriginally went to press in December, 2006, the price of uranuim has risen to $113 per pound], people \nare pushing for access to lands across the West. Companies seeing a modern day uranium rush are \nstaking claims to the boundaries of the Navajo Nation, which Mark Pelizza, vice president of Uranium \nResources, Inc. (URI), calls the “Saudi Arabia of Uranium.”   URI could start mining in Church Rock\n \nin 2008; if they convince regulators that the work is environmentally sound, they could also begin min-\ning in Crownpoint.\nTh e Navajo Nation is saying “no” to such eﬀ orts.  T wo years ago it passed a ban on mining or \nprocessing uranium in “Navajo Indian Country,” a term designed to safeguard the reservation and \nneighboring communities.  But despite the ban, the uranium companies continue to push for access, \nforcing tribal President Joe Shirley, Jr. to sign an executive order that instructed all tribal employees to \n“avoid any communication with uranium company employees.”  However, the Navajo Nation remains \npoor and the uranium companies are banking on that to shift perception their way in order to gain \naccess.  Th ey continue to push their agenda with lobbying eﬀ orts in Washington to increase accessibil-\nity while keeping uranium prices sky-high.  From the Navajo perspective, no mining can occur when \nthere remain more than 1,000 unreclaimed uranium mines and no funds to clean them up. Th e Navajo \ncontinue to ﬁ ght:  protesting, educating their people, and going to Washington.\nIn terms of global warming, it is true that nuclear power is a cleaner source of energy than coal ﬁ red \nplants or even natural gas, because nukes don’t produce carbon dioxide (if you ignore the mining.)  But \nto have a tangible impact on global warming would require a major construction undertaking.  In order \nto displace fossil fuels worldwide, we would need to construct 10,000-30,000 new nuclear power \nplants to produce the needed 12.8 trillion watts of world energy.  Remember, today there are slightly \ncontinued from page 1.WHY NUCLEAR ISN’T THE ANSWER\nIn 2000, a pound \nof uranium cost \nless than $10.  In \nApril 2007, that \nsame pound of \nuranium costs \n$113.\nExisting nuclear \npower plant waste:\n52,000 tons\nspent radioactive fuel\n91,000,000 gallons\nhigh-level radioactive \nwaste from plutonium \nreprocessing\n500,000+ tons\ndepleted uranium\n265 million tons\nuranium tailings\nmillions of tons\nlow-level radioactive \ncontaminated items \nfrom power plants\n4\n\n“Once again, it’s \ntime to infuse \nsome sanity into \nthe energy debate.  \nPerhaps with this \nCongress we can \nturn a page…one \nthat for the ﬁ rst \ntime makes energy \ndevelopment and \nproduction com-\npatible with clean \nair, water and \nstronger \ncommunities.”\nmore than 400 existing plants.  While many can argue that it’s a positive step to get more nuclear power \nonline to reduce greenhouse gases, if we refocus our energy priorities, we can obtain the same results by \nconserving and using alternative energy sources.\nDisposal\nLet’s take a look at that messy problem of disposing of radioactive waste produced by nuclear power \nplants. According to a recent article in National Geographic, currently in the US there are more than \n52,000 tons of spent radioactive fuel from our nation’s commercial and defense nuclear reactors.  Th ere \nare also more than 91 million gallons of high-level waste left over from plutonium processing, scores of \ntons of plutonium, more than half a million tons of depleted uranium, and millions of cubic feet of con-\ntaminated tools, metal scraps, clothing, oils, solvents and other wastes.  In addition, there are more than \n265 million tons of tailings from milling uranium ore.  Th e government’s solution is to transport some of \nthe low-level waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) facility just east of Carlsbad.  But the more \nambitious proposal is to build a repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.\nYucca Mountain is located only 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas.  It is the only US site currently \nproposed to store more than 77,000 tons of high-level radioactive waste from US weapons sites and com-\nmercial nuclear reactors.  Th e nuclear industry has thus far succeeded, thanks to a very aggressive lob-\nbying eﬀ ort, to overturn Nevada’s veto of the Yucca Mountain proposal in 2002.  Yet to date, numerous \nscientiﬁ c, economic and policy problems continue to plague the Yucca Mountain project.  Th e proposed \ndump faces an uncertain future in upcoming regulatory, legislative and legal processes.  Meanwhile, the \nwaste pile continues to grow at existing nuclear power plants and the security of those plants remains \nquestionable.\nThe future \nStarting with Congress, it is essential that we begin to seriously fund clean alternative energy sources.  We \ndo not need nuclear power to ﬁ ght global warming, nor do we need it to supply our growing energy \ndemands.  We have vast renewable energy sources, especially wind and solar energy, which dwarf the \npotential of nuclear power.  Energy eﬃ  ciency is also the key to our energy future.  However, it begins \nwith an Apollo-like investment in alternative energy.  Let’s put $12 billion or so into solar research and \ndevelopment every year for the next ten years.  Let’s also put serious money into energy eﬃ  ciency and \ndesigning automobiles that get 200-300 miles per gallon.\nRenewable energy is now growing without serious government support at a rate of 30-40% per year \nin virtually all sectors.  Th ese energy sources are developing without the threat of terrorists, contamina-\ntion, waste disposal issues and are also helping to make communities more self-suﬃ  cient.  Th ey are also \ncreating long-term employment for people across the country.  Will alternatives be enough to stop global \nwarming?  Th e jury is still out.  But it will clearly be alternative energy sources that make America cleaner \nand less dependent on Middle-East oil and politics, while creating energy that does not threaten global \nstability.  Much like electric cars, there are special interests that do not want power generation that is not \ncentralized and full of government subsidies.\nOnce again, it’s time to infuse some sanity into the energy debate.  Perhaps with this Congress we can \nturn a page…one that for the ﬁ rst time makes energy development and production compatible with clean \nair, water and stronger communities.\nSee this article in its entirety, including its discussion about nuclear proliferation and security issues, at \nwww.nmenvirolaw.org/news, or at www.nmwild.org.

Th e Law Center’s eﬀ  orts in the session were aided con-\nsiderably by the volunteer work done by Don Goldman, who reviewed \nbills as they were introduced and brought to our attention those that \ncould impact communities or the environment.  We are grateful to Don \nfor his assistance.\nProtective Legislation\nFirst, the Law Center and its legislative partners, the Oil and Gas \nAccountability Project and the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Asso-\nciation, were able to pass the \nNew Mexico Surface Owner Protection \nAct (SOPA), sponsored by Sen. Phil Griego.  While the Bill that \nwas eventually signed into law by Governor Richardson was a com-\npromise between the surface owner advocates and the oil and gas \nindustry, the SOPA goes a long way to protect surface owners from \nenvironmental and property damage done by oil and gas operations \non their land.  In fact, the New Mexico SOPA is the strongest sur-\nface owner protection act in the country.   \nSecond, the Law Center, the Environmental Justice Working Group \nof the Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice, \nand other environmental justice advocacy organizations worked for \npassage of the \nNew Mexico Environmental Health Act.   Th is bill, \nwhich was sponsored by Sen. Linda Lopez and Rep. Miguel Garcia, \nwould have required that the State Environment Department take \ninto account the impacts of its decisions on communities, some-\nthing that the Department currently does not do except in limited \ncircumstances.  \nTh e bill was quickly killed in the Senate by the industry-friendly \nConservation Committee.  After it became apparent that House Bill \n888 would fail as well, the Law Center and the E.J. Working Group \ndrafted House Memorial 97, which passed.  Th e Memorial calls \nfor the State Environment Department to determine how it can \ntake into account the impacts of its decisions on communities.  It \nis not yet clear what process the Department will use to make this \ndetermination, but we at the Law Center and the Environmental \nJustice Working Group intend to be involved in the Department’s \nconsideration of the issue. \n \nHarmful Legislation\nFortunately the Law Center and its allies were able to stop a particu-\nlarly noxious memorial introduced by freshman senator David Uli-\nbarri.  Th e \nNuclear Energy and Uranium Resources Joint Memorial \nsought to welcome the uranium mining industry into New Mexico.  \nFurther, the Memorial directed the State to “remove all regulatory \nbarriers” to uranium mining in New Mexico.  We are happy to re-\nport that the Law Center and a coalition of native, environmental \nand clean energy groups were able to kill the memorial before it \nreached the Senate ﬂ oor.  However, as uranium prices keep climbing, \nsimilar measures undoubtedly will be introduced in future sessions.\nAnother principal piece of negative legislation that was considered \nduring the session was House Bill 685, the \nAdministrative Account-\nability Act.  Sponsored by Rep. Daniel Silva and backed by the New \nMexico Mining Association, the Association of Commerce and In-\ndustry, and others, the Bill would have curtailed the ability of State \nregulatory agencies to provide meaningful protection for commu-\nnities and the environment.  Among its other provisions, the Bill as \noriginally introduced would have \n• prevented state agencies from conducting unannounced in-\nspections of regulated facilities; \n• required agencies to make public the names of whistle blowers; \n• prohibited agencies from putting conditions into permits \nunless they were speciﬁ cally authorized by statute; and \n• required agencies to pay ﬁ  nes if they failed to comply with \nthe Bill’s requirements.\nAlthough we and our allies got the Bill killed in committee, industry \ngroups were able to persuade the Legislature to pass two memorials.  \nTh ese memorials, which were identical as introduced by Sen. Ben \nAltamirano and Rep. Al Park, call for the establishment of a task \nforce to review and make recommendations concerning procedures \nused by state administrative agencies.  Before the Senate Memorial \nwas passed, however, it was amended by Sen. Linda Lopez to in-\nclude, among others, two representatives of environmental justice \ncommunities.  \nIt is not clear how the diﬀ  erences between the two memorials will \nbe resolved or whether there will be two task forces.  Each memo-\nrial calls for the task force it establishes to report to the appropri-\nate interim legislative committee in the fall of this year.

She moved to Santa Fe in 1996 from \nWashington D.C., where she served for nine years as Greenpeace International’s Paciﬁ c Campaign \nCo-Coordinator, where the environmental and public health impacts of nuclear weapons production \nand chemical weapons destruction were central to her work.  Global warming has also topped her list \nof priorities for the past twenty years, with a strong focus on how climate clange impacts the environ-\nment, societies and economies in the Paciﬁ c Islands region.  Sebia also participated in Greenpeace \nUS’s internal organizational work on diversity and environmental justice issues in the early 1990s, and \nthen worked for the Federated States of Micronesia between 1999-2003.  “Coral reef destruction, the \nloss of ﬁ sheries and the loss of fresh water resources are creating the world’s ﬁ rst climate refugees in the \nPaciﬁ c,” she says, “but global warming is going to aﬀ ect everyone on the planet, starting with the least \npowerful communities in fragile environments – just like we have in New Mexico.”\nTh rough her environmental justice work, Sebia came to know many of New Mexico’s environ-\nmental justice leaders and issues of concern in northern New Mexico.  For the past ten years, she has \nworked as a consultant, board member and volunteer for numerous New Mexico non-proﬁ t organiza-\ntions that focus on the environment, environmental justice, and sustainable community issues.  She \nlooks forward to beoming well-acquainted with the Law Center’s members, and is already working diligently to build the organization’s \nfundraising and communications capacity.\nJuana Colón, Oﬃ  ce Manager\nJuana moved to Santa Fe from Brooklyn, NY where she lived for 10 years. She moved to \nBrooklyn from Buﬀ alo, NY in the hopes of putting her degree in Art History to use, but \nover time became disenchanted with the Big City. After completing her masters degree in \narchaeology in 2005, Juana wanted to ﬁ nd a community that was interested in serving the \nindigenous cultural landscape as well as preserving the ecological one. If you ask her why \nshe came to New Mexico, she’ll say “I needed more sky in my life.”\nAt the Law Center, Juana has found a place to contribute her many talents along with \nfeeding her passion for the protection of the environment and encouraging sustainable \nliving. Her hobbies include weaving, baking, enjoying the outdoors with friends and try-\ning to ﬁ nd new uses for old things.

Joanna, who is the owner of HurleyMedia in Santa Fe, did a wonderful job \nhelping the Law Center with our public relations since coming on our board in 2002.  \nShe has also served with distinction on our development committee.  Bill joined our \nboard in 2005.  He oﬀ ered us the beneﬁ t of his broad knowledge of non-proﬁ t manage-\nment, as well as his deep wisdom and thoughtful eloquence about the environment in \nwhich we live.  We sincerely thank Joanna and Bill for their service to the Law Center, \nand to the environment and communities of New Mexico.\nIn Memoriam – Wilfred Rael\nTh e Law Center is profoundly sorry to report the death of Wilfred Rael of Questa, a \nlong time advocate for protection of New Mexico’s water resources generally and acequia \nsystems in particular.  Wilfred was a gentle man who worked for years to restore the Red \nRiver, which was polluted by the Molycorp mine in Questa, and who advocated tirelessly \nfor the protection of New Mexico’s acequia systems.  \nWilfred’s work for New Mexico’s ground and surface water was the basis for the Law Cen-\nter’s 1992 award to him of the ﬁ rst Karl Souder Award for protection of New Mexico’s \nwater resources.  In his speech accepting that Award, Wilfred said:  “Our enemy is the \nproduct of greed, and it thrives on poverty, apathy, ignorance, and a lack of education.”  \nWilfred understood the forces that he was working against, and he was willing to name \nthem.  We will all miss him as we work to continue his legacy.\nMission\nTh e New Mexico Environmental Law \nCenter is a nonproﬁ t, public interest \nlaw ﬁ rm that provides free and low-cost \nlegal services on environmental matters \nthroughout New Mexico.

We would be with you in person if we could.  Today we \nare also ﬁ ghting our common enemy, Uranium Resources, Inc. (which wholly owns Hydro \nResources, Inc.), at the Texas state capitol in Austin.\nWe have been both seduced and deceived by URI’s lies about the safety \nof its mining operation, and its false promises of restoration.  \nWhen our people signed the uranium leases, they were told that the min-\ning would leave the water cleaner than it had ever been.  The state \nhas told us many times that it would protect our air, our land, and our \ngroundwater.\nIn truth, our groundwater has been contaminated by uranium mining with \nno hope of ever being restored.  Our land has been contaminated and we \nsee no future where we will ever be able to farm it again.  Our air is \ncontaminated with radon and its poisons.  Our people daily live with \nfear.  \nIn the past two months there have been two explosions at the URI plant \nnear Kingsville.  URI has denied the truth about those explosions to \nstate and federal inspectors.  Many spills of thousands of gallons of \ncontaminated liquids are recorded in state ﬁ les.  URI continues to re-\nfuse to honor its promise to restore previously mined ﬁ elds.\nWe see the hunger for proﬁ t at the expense of the earth and its gifts.  We see the \ndisregard for human and animal lives.  We see the corruption of elected ofﬁ cials and \nstate employees.\nOn this day when you, our neighbors in New Mexico, stand against the evils of uranium \nmining, we stand with you.  We are proud to be called your friends and allies.\nSigned: Members of South Texas Opposes Pollution (STOP)\nOur Navajo clients met with soli-\ndarity from residents in T exas, who \nare ﬁ ghting an existing in situ leach \nuranium mine operated by HRI’s \nparent company, Uranium Resources, \nInc. in Kingsville, TX.

The \nCenter’s founding was spurred by \na statewide election, after which \nmy co-incorporators, Susan Tixier \nand Sharon Murray, and I felt \nthat we had to protect our natural \nenvironment from an administration \nthat was not living up to its \nresponsibility to protect these \nspecial places.\nSoon it became apparent that \nthe government was not doing an \nadequate job to protect the people \nof New Mexico either, causing the \nLaw Center to shift its primary focus \nfrom the protection of public lands \nto the protection of communities \nthat are fighting to safeguard their \nenvironments, their health, and \ntheir cultures.  With these goals, I \nam proud to say that the Law Center \nstaff has been key to some of the \nmost important environmental \nvictories that New Mexico has seen \nin the past two decades, including \nthe passage of critical laws that \nprotect people and the environment \nfrom pollution and victories in \nlandmark cases.\nThrough the generosity of donors, \nfoundations and volunteers, we have \ngrown from one part-time, unpaid \nattorney to four full-time lawyers \nand four key staff members who \nwork every day to ensure that water \nis safe for all New Mexicans to drink, \nthe air is safe for all to breathe, \nand that our unique cultures are \npreserved for the future. \nWe thank you for your support of \nour work, and hope that you will be \nwith us for the next twenty years as \nwe continue our journey.\nYours truly, Douglas Meiklejohn \nExecutive Director\nCelebrating 20 Y ears\nCelebrating T wenty Years of Environmental and Community Victories  nmenvirolaw.org      1 \nContents\n20 Stories: Pages 2-5\nWaste Case: pg.2\n“This was a true David-and-Goliath type \nbattle,” recounts Lujan.  “The community \nsold enchiladas and gorditas as a way to \nraise funds to hire expert witnesses.”\nCase Updates: Pages 6-8\nLaw Center Helps Win Victories: pg.6\nNew Mexico’s surface waters and public \nlands are better protected now, after \ncourts agreed with two friend-of-the-\ncourt briefs filed by the Law Center \nin 2005.\nNRC decisions must be reversed: pg.7\n“The NRC’s decisions must be reversed \nbecause they fail to ensure that the public \nhealth, safety and the environment will \nbe protected from air and groundwater \ncontamination if HRI is allowed to mine \nuranium under its license.”\nNews: Page 9-10 \nNewest Addition to NMELC: pg.9\nOur newest Staff Attorney, Bruce \nFrederick, was probably expecting a tour \nof the office and a welcome lunch when \nhe started his job as Law Center Staff \nAttorney in June. \nby Douglas Meiklejohn\n—Aldo Leopold A Sand County Almanac\nLaw Center attorneys and staff work every \nday to ensure that water is safe for all New \nMexicans to drink.  \nA publication of the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, a non-profit, public interest \n                  law firm dedicated to protecting New Mexico’s environment and communities. nmenvirolaw.org\nWe reached    \nthe old wolf in   \ntime to watch a \nfierce green fire \ndying in her eyes.”\n \n“\nT“\n\nAnniversary Series\n      2      Celebrating T wenty Years of Environmental and Community Victories  nmenvirolaw.org \nsked about the Law Center’s \nvictory against the Nu-Mex \nmedical waste incinerator, Antonio \nLujan remembers that “The \ntownspeople had already organized \nthemselves under the banner of \n‘Concerned Citizens of Sunland Park’ \nto fight the proposed Nu-Mex landfill \nwhen the incinerator opened and \nwas completely unregulated.  There \nwere hypodermic needles laying \naround, there were no pollution \ncontrols, and the place would burn at \nnight.” Lujan, who then worked as a \ncommunity organizer for the Diocese \nof Las Cruces, also remembers \nthat residents developed allergies \nand rashes, and children at nearby \nschools became sick from the odors.  \n“The Bishop heard about the landfill \nand incinerator and asked me to \ncheck things out; it turned into a \ntwo-and-a-half year long project.”\nSharing common concerns \nabout incinerators and landfills, \nDouglas Meiklejohn met members \nof Concerned Citizens around \n1990. Lujan explained that \nthis was the first time in New \nMexico that a grassroots Hispanic \ncommunity formed an alliance with \nenvironmental groups.  “We worked \nwith environmentalists like Lynda \nTaylor at the Southwest Research \nand Information Center and the New \nMexico Environmental Law Center \n– that had never been done before.  \nFor me, the significance was \nthe effectiveness of a passionate \ngrassroots \norganization that \nhad technical expertise within \nits reach.”\nWhile the State seemed ready to \ngrant the landfill a ten-year permit \nwithout conditions, Concerned \nCitizens fought for the permit to be \ndenied outright.  In addition, the \ngroup confronted a system in which \nNu-Mex hired Sunland Park’s mayor \nand city attorney as lobbyists, and \nthe town’s state senator as \nits attorney.\n“This was a true David-and-Goliath \ntype battle,” recounts Lujan.  “The \ncommunity sold enchiladas and \ngorditas as a way to raise funds to \nhire expert witnesses.”  In a major \nvictory, Concerned Citizens and the \nLaw Center persuaded the State to \nreverse its position by taking into \naccount the air emissions from the \nsmokestack – a position that led to \nthe closure of the incinerator.  In \naddition, the State also issued a five-\nyear landfill permit with several \nstringent conditions, including a \nliner requirement and water quality \nmonitoring – conditions never \nimposed before.\nThis case helped the Law Center \nsuccessfully lobby for strict \nincinerator regulations, including \nbuffer zones of at least one mile \nbetween people and waste-burning \nfacilities.  No incinerators have since \nbeen built in New Mexico. \nThe Law Center is now the only \nnot-for-profit law firm specializing in \nenvironmental justice issues in New \nMexico.

He is proud of how the \norganization has grown during the \npast twenty years.  “The Law Center \nis the most important environmental \norganization in New Mexico today,” \nhe states.  “It has credibility in \nthe legislature, credibility with \ncommunities, and it \nalways takes on \nthe right issues.”\nThis issue marks the first of four Green Fire Reports that will celebrate the Law Center’s twentieth anniversary over the next year.

You are Breaking our Hearts!\nDon’t Mine Indian Clay”\nby Shelbie Knox\ntop!  You are Breaking our \nHearts!  Don’t Mine Indian \nClay.”  The sign held by the woman \nat the entrance to the Oglebay \nNorton mica mine echoed the \nsentiments of the Picuris People who \nstood shoulder to shoulder with her, \nblocking trucks from entering the \nmine in November 2002.  Despite the \nshow of public opposition to both \nthe mine and the Velarde-based mill, \nhowever, things looked bleak.  \nThe facility had grown into the \nlargest mica mine west of the \nMississippi River, and the company \nwas seeking a permit to expand \nthe site.  While the Law Center was \nfighting hard to ensure that the \npermit included provisions to protect \nthe environment and mitigate \ncultural impacts, there was little \ndoubt that the mine would continue \nto grow.\nIn any other place, this mine \nwould have been an environmental \nnuisance.  But here at Picuris, the \nmine was eating away at a culture \nthat had depended upon the \nmicaceous clay that had been found \nat the site since time immemorial, \naccording to the tribe’s elder potters.  \n“The clay is not only a pot,” describes \nformer Picuris Governor Gerald \nNailor, recounting the importance \nof the earth to his People. “It teaches \nyou how to live.  It guides you.  It \ngives you strength.”   \nThe Law Center began its \nrepresentation of Picuris Pueblo in \n1998.  The Pueblo had approached \nLaw Center attorneys a year earlier \nto help it defeat a proposed copper \nmine, but had been \nsuccessful in \nworking with \nneighbors to \nrally enough \ncommunity \nopposition to \nscuttle the project. \nTheir success \ngave them hope \nthat they could \nstop the grievous \nmica mine.  \nUnfortunately for \nthe tribe, “It was \neasier to stop a \nmine that didn’t \nexist,” recounts \nRichard Mermejo, \nformer Mine Reclamation Liaison \nand Picuris Governor, “than to \nstop a mine that was already in the \nground, growing every year.”  Six \nyears after their copper mine victory, \nthey would be holding their second \nprotest at the mine, wondering if the \ndestruction would ever stop. \n“We are a small community going \nup against a giant corporation, \nwith its fleet of lawyers and vice-\npresidents; we can use all of the help \nthat we can get.  While our People \npicket the mine in protest, the New \nMexico Environmental Law Center is \nworking to stop the mine in \nthe courts.”\nUnbeknownst to the public or \nthe mining company, the Pueblo \nadopted a new legal strategy in \n2001.  While Law Center attorneys \nstill worked to limit the company’s \npermits, the tribal government \ndecided to pursue a long-shot.  The \nLaw Center allied itself with Indian \nlaw experts Richard \nHughes and Curtis \nBerkey along with the Western \nEnvironmental Law Center to pursue \nan aboriginal title claim for the land \non which the mine was sited.  The \npremise?  That Picuris Pueblo had \nnever given up the land, which had \nbeen bought by mining companies \nfor $5.00/acre from the U.S. \ngovernment under the federal 1872 \nMining Law.\nThe world’s foremost academic \nexperts on Tiwa culture worked with \nPueblo members to document the \noral history pertaining to the site, \nwhile pottery experts proved that \nancient pottery sherds originated in \nthe clay pits at the site.  In the end, \nthe case was strong enough that \nthe Pueblo was able to negotiate \nwith the mining companies that \nhad operated the mine, achieving \nthe unimaginable:  the return of \nthe land to the Picuris People.  The \nday that the land was returned \nto the Pueblo was bittersweet                                  \nStory Continued page 8>\n1990\nSuccessfully advocates for \npassage of the New Mexico \nSolid Waste Act\n1991\nRepresents Citizens of \nSunland Park in hearings to \nstop permits for a medical waste \nincinerator and landfill.

Decision \nmakers listen to attorneys and \nexperts.  The mining company comes \narmed with multiple attorneys, \nnumbers of credentialed experts, \nlobbyists in the hallways – all \ndesigned to intimidate, overpower \nand exhaust the citizens who dare \nmount any opposition.”\nThose words were written by a \nwoman who has become intimately \nacquainted with the realities of \ntrying to protect a place she loves \nfrom pollution.  Beginning in 1991, \nJeanie Cragin and her neighbors \nstopped the proposed Placer Dome \ngold mine near Cerrillos, then \nmoved on to tackle the Cunningham \nHill cyanide heap-leach gold mine \nin the Ortiz Mountains, which had \nbecome contaminated during the \n1970s and 1980s.  \n“I remember that we – the Friends \nof Santa Fe County – had to find \na lawyer after we showed up at a \ndischarge permit hearing and the \nhearing officer wouldn’t recognize \nus,” she recalls. “Even though \nhydrologist Art Montana was an \nintegral member of Friends of \nSanta Fe County, the State didn’t \nallow us to fully participate until \nwe were represented by counsel.  \nThat is when we got the Law \nCenter involved.  Attorneys Doug \nMeiklejohn and Doug Wolf not \nonly knew the law, but they were \nrespected by the regulators, and that \nrespect was transferred to us during \nthose proceedings.”  \nOver the next several \nyears, Friends worked \non several tracks to \nforce the cleanup \nof the Cunningham \nHill site, including a \nfederal Clean Water Act \nlawsuit.  Eventually LAC \nMinerals Inc., owners \nof Cunningham Hill \nmine, and previous \nmine operators, were \nforced to the settlement \nnegotiation table.  \nRepresented by former \nLaw Center attorney \nDoug Wolf, Friends reached an \nagreement that created the 1,350 acre \nOrtiz Mountain Educational Preserve \nand led to the reclamation of the site, \nincluding the cleanup of two plumes \nof contaminated groundwater \nbeneath the mine.\nWatching Doug Wolf in \naction was like watching Jack the \nGiant Killer.

This revision was \nappealed by several industry groups.  \nRepresenting the Concerned Citizens \nLaw Center Helps Win Victories\nfor Surface Waters, Public Lands\nby Sarah Piltch and Eric Jantz\nfor Clean Water in Clovis, the Law \nCenter filed a friend-of-the-court \nbrief in support of the State and \nseveral conservation groups.  In May \n2007, the Court of Appeals upheld \nthe Commission’s revised language, \nhanding a victory to the Law Center’s \nclient and allies, and New Mexico’s \nsurface waters.\nIn southwestern New Mexico, we \nwon a victory in June 2007 when the \nNew Mexico Supreme Court ruled \nthat cattle watering-rights do not \ngive ranchers the implicit right to \ngraze their cattle on public lands.  \nThis case stemmed from a lawsuit \nfiled by Roy and Shellie Walker, \new Mexico’s surface \nwaters and public \nlands are better \nprotected now, after courts   \n     agreed with two friend-\n       of-the-court briefs filed \nits Tyrone closure permit to the NM \nCourt of Appeals in 2005, the Court \nupheld every permit condition \nbut two, ruling that the NM Water \nQuality Control Commission must \nreexamine whether or not the \nTyrone mine facility is a “place of \nwithdrawal of water for present or \nreasonably foreseeable future use.”  \nPhelps Dodge argues that the mine \nfacility is not, and will not be, a place \nof withdrawal, and therefore is not \nprotected under the State’s Water \nQuality Act.  Using this strategy, the \ncompany hopes to avoid cleaning \nup the extensive \ngroundwater \nFighting for Clean Up\nat Phelps Dodge T yrone Mine\nby Bruce Frederick\ncontamination beneath its mine \nfacility and also to avoid re-grading \nand covering most of its waste rock \nand ore piles.  \nIn a hearing before the \nCommission this summer, the Law \nCenter represents the Gila Resources \nInformation Project (GRIP), which \nis aligned with the New Mexico \nEnvironment Department in arguing \nthat the site is indeed a place of \nwithdrawal, and that the company \nmust observe its strict reclamation \nrequirements.  As this issue goes to \nprint, we are awaiting a decision \nfrom the Commission.\nP\nhelps Dodge’s Tyrone mine \nfacility covers nearly 10,000 \nacres of land and contains over a \nbillion tons of crushed waste rock \nand ore piles derived mostly from \ntwo huge open pit copper mines.  \nThe company mines the copper by \nsprinkling thousands of acre-feet of \nacidic solution onto the ore piles per \nyear; the solution dissolves copper \nfrom the ore as it drains through \nthe pile, and is then collected in \nthe natural drainages underlying \nthe piles and piped to a copper \nextraction plant.  \nWhen Phelps \nDodge appealed \nCase Updates\nN\n1999\nRepresents acequia \nassociations and individuals \nfighting to preserve traditional \nNM agriculture\n2001\nHelps to defeat proposed \nlegislation that would give \n$30 million in subsidies to the \nnuclear industry\n2000\nCo-founds the New \nMexico Mining Act Network, \na coalition of grassroots \norganizations and experts \nStory Continued page 7>\nImage: Darla Hallmark|Agency: Dreamstime.com\nImages: 1999: Don Usner • 2000: LightHawk\n\nCelebrating T wenty Years of Environmental and Community Victories  nmenvirolaw.org     7\nin support of our case.  We have \nrequested oral arguments before the \n10th Circuit Court of Appeals, and are \nawaiting an answer to this request.  \nIn a separate matter, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission seeks to issue \na “Generic Environmental Impact \nStatement” (GEIS) to address what \nit labels “generic” issues associated \nwith in situ leach uranium mining \nnationwide.  Such issues could include \ngroundwater restoration, hydrology, \nand environmental justice.  \nThe Law Center and its clients, the \nHaaku Water Office of Acoma Pueblo \nand, the Southwest Research and \nInformation Center, are involved in \nNuclear Regulatory Commission\nLandmark Fights Underway\nby Eric Jantz\nthis process, which has extraordinary \nimplications for New Mexico and the \nwestern United States.  If the NRC is \nallowed to finalize the GEIS, it will:  \n1) allow uranium mining companies \nto avoid in-depth environmental \nanalysis in the form of a site specific \nenvironmental impact statement; 2) \nincrease the speed at which the NRC \nissues nuclear licenses to ISL mining \ncompanies; and 3) severely restrict the \namount of public input on a specific \nmining project.  \nThe public comment period ends on \nOctober 8.

For decades, Tom was a \ntrue champion for New Mexico’s \npublic lands, fighting for rangeland \nreform, riparian enhancement, \nwildlife protection and wilderness \ndesignations.\nFervor to protect the state’s delicate \necology led Tom to the Law Center \nin 1993, when he was represented, \ns a resident of Cerrillos during \nthe 1990s, Renee became \ninvolved with the Law Center when \nit represented citizens’ groups \nfighting gold mining in Cerrillos \nand advocated for state-wide mining \nreform.  Inspired by the energy and \ndevotion of the staff, volunteers and \nboard of the Law Center, she became \na Director on the Board of the Law \nCenter in 2001.  \nRenee feels that supporting \nenvironmental justice is “key to \nthe environmental movement \nbecause the people most affected \nby environmental degradation \nare the disenfranchised and poor, \nwho have no resources to stave off \nintrusions in their communities. The \nLaw Center’s job is to protect those \nwithout voices in legal proceedings \nand to give them voices to fight for \nthemselves.”\nThrough her close relationship \nwith Bob Stark of the New Mexico \nCommunity Foundation, Renee \nrealized that her charitable giving \ncould create a legacy of giving to \nsupport the environmental justice \nwork she loves.  With a generous \ngift of $35,000, Renee established \nthe New Mexico Environmental Law \nCenter Endowment, a permanent \nendowment that will generate \nincome for the Law Center for many \ngenerations to come.  \nThe timing of Renee’s generosity \nto the Law Center was intentional.  \nAs the Law Center moves into its \n20th year of serving New Mexico \ncommunities and protecting our \nenvironment, she feels endowment \ngiving is important because it \ncontributes so much to long-term \nstrategic planning.

Th e new standard \nof 30 micrograms/liter (μ/l), which is the same as the US Environmental Protection Agency’s drinking \nwater standard, was revised from a 5,000 μ/l standard set in the 1970s during the last uranium boom in \nNew Mexico. \nShortly after the new standard was adopted, it was challenged by the NM Mining Association and the \nNM Oil and Gas Association, which asserted that uranium mining operators would be unable to meet \nthe standard. Law Center attorney Eric Jantz, who represented ENDAUM in the appeal, has a diﬀ erent \ntake on the situation. \n“Th e old standard was basically a license to pollute,” says Jantz. “Th e new standard recognizes the \nthreat that uranium poses to people who drink contaminated water. Th e New Mexico Court of Ap-\npeals unanimously agreed with us that human health is more important than uranium companies’ \nright to pollute groundwater.”\nIt is unknown at this time whether the industry groups will appeal to the NM Supreme Court.  \nZ\nNew Environmental Justice Provisions \nfor Solid Waste Facilities\nIn a proceeding that has taken several years from start to ﬁ nish, the New Mexico Environmental \nImprovement Board has adopted amendments to the State Solid Waste Management Regulations that \ninclude provisions designed to ensure environmental justice in the regulation of major solid waste facili-\nties such as landﬁ lls and incinerators. Although the Board did not accept all of the recommendations \nmade by the Law Center, our clients, and other environmental justice advocates, the amendments to \nthe Regulations do provide signiﬁ cant protection for low income communities and communities of \ncolor.\nTh e proceeding that led to the Environmental Improvement Board’s action began several years ago \ncontinued on page 2\nFor an in-depth discussion of the new uranium boom, see Voices from the Earth, Fall 2006 (Vol. 7, No. 3) at www.sric.org. \nFor more information on this case, or to link to the Los Angeles Times’  “Blighted Homeland,” (a four-part series which \ndetails the past, present and future of uranium mining in Navajo communities through articles and photo essays) and \nthe Santa Fe Reporter’s “Yellowcake Blues,” (a cover story about ENDAUM’s ﬁ ght) see the Law Center website, \nwww.nmenvirolaw.org/news.\nAbove:  photos from Church Rock, \nNM, near where HRI proposes to \nsink hundreds of uranium mining \nwells.

Our attorneys will be \nworking to enact legislation to protect communities and \nthe environment and to prevent enactment of legislation \nthat would harm them. Regrettably, we anticipate that the \nmeasures that will be introduced that would adversely aﬀ ect \ncommunities and the environment will outnumber those \nthat would favor our communities and the environment.\nTh ere is at least one piece of legislation that we anticipate \nworking to pass. It is titled the Surface Owner Protec-\ntion Act, and it would provide protection for the owners \nof the surface of the land who do not own the mineral \nestate beneath the surface. Under current law, as decided \nby the New Mexico courts, the mineral estate is dominant, \nwhich means that the owner of minerals such as oil and gas \ncan come onto the surface of the land and use appropri-\nate means to extract the minerals. Current law also pro-\nvides that the mineral owner does not have an obligation \nto provide notice to the surface owner or to compensate \nthe surface owner for damages to the surface unless the \nmineral owner’s negligence, or carelessness, causes damage \nbeyond what would normally be expected for the extrac-\ntion operation. Th e Surface Owner Protection Act would \nchange that by requiring that the surface owner be provided \nwith notice, and that damages be paid to the surface owner \neven if the extraction of minerals is not done in a negligent \nmanner. \nOne of the most environmentally dangerous pieces of \nlegislation that we expect to be introduced is a bill that \nwould limit the state to protecting surface waters (rivers, \nstreams, lakes, etc.) that are within the federal deﬁ nition \nof “waters of the United States.” Th at is the deﬁ nition that \nidentiﬁ es waters protected by the United States under the \nfederal Clean Water Act, and it has been narrowed signiﬁ -\ncantly during recent years by the Bush administration and \nwhen the State Environment Department proposed amend-\nments to the Regulations, including amendments designed to \npromote environmental justice. Th ose proposed amendments \nwere the subject of several rounds of comments to the De-\npartment and negotiations between many interested parties. \nTh e Law Center represented two clients in the proceedings, \nthe SouthWest Organizing Project and the South Valley (of \nAlbuquerque) Coalition of Neighborhood Associations. Th e \nother principal environmental justice advocate throughout the \nprocess was the Environmental Justice Working Group of the \nSouthwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice. \nAs adopted, the amendments to the Regulations provide \nthat an applicant for a permit to site a new major solid waste \nfacility, or to expand an existing major facility, will have to de-\ntermine whether the proposed or existing facility is in a “vul-\nnerable area.” Th e only exception to this is if the area where \nthe existing or proposed facility is located has been designated \nfor that type of facility through a zoning process that included \nconsideration of environmental justice issues. \nTh e amendments deﬁ ne “vulnerable area” to mean an area \nwithin a four mile radius of the proposed or existing facility \nthat has: \n1)  at least 50 people within New Mexico; \n2)  a greater percentage of low income households (deﬁ ned \nas having an income less than 150% of the federal pov-\nerty guidelines for a family of four) within any square \nmile area than are in the state as a whole; and\n3)  at least three regulated facilities (deﬁ ned as including \nvarious facilities that can aﬀ ect the environment signiﬁ -\ncantly) other than the facility at issue.\nIf the proposed or existing facility that is the subject of the \npermit application is located in a vulnerable area, the ap-\nplicant for the permit to site or expand the facility will have \nto demonstrate that issuance of the permit will not have a \ndisproportionate impact on any socioeconomic group. In \naddition, if the existing or proposed facility is located in a vul-\nnerable area, and if there is signiﬁ cant opposition to the siting \nor expansion of the facility, the amendments require that the \napplicant prepare a community impact report to determine \nwhat the impact of granting the application will be on the \ncommunity.   \nBoth of these requirements are entirely new, and they will \ndo much to protect low income communities and com-\nmunities of color where more than three regulated \nfacilities are already located from the impacts of \nmajor solid waste facilities. Th e Law Center, its clients, \nand the Environmental Justice Working Group intend to \nwork to ensure that these mandates are fulﬁ lled, and that \nthe purpose of achieving environmental justice for these \ncommunities is achieved.   \nZ\nSolid Waste Regulations, continued from page 1\n2  LAW CENTER NEWS\n\n\nFare Thee Well...\nTh e Law Center bids farewell to Oﬃ  ce Manager Allison Dellinger and Earl James, \nour Director of Programs and Development. \nFor 10 years, Allison kept the Law Center oﬃ  ce running smoothly. We half-jok-\ningly dubbed her our “global troubleshooter,” as she worked as our legal secretary, \nknower of all things that run on electricity, board and staﬀ  wrangler, receptionist, \nfundraiser, event planner and handywoman, to name but a few of her jobs. In addi-\ntion, Allison served as our staﬀ  liaison to several local and statewide groups, including \nSanta Fe Earth Day and the New Mexico Food and Agricultural Policy Council. But \nshe brought much more than eﬃ  ciency and the spectacular ability to multi-task to \nour oﬃ  ce; Allison also contributed a conscientious spirit, commitment to our mis-\nsion, and true caring for her colleagues and for the people with whom we work\nDuring Earl’s six years at the Law Center, he worked to increase our annual budget \nby nearly $250,000, expand the Center’s outreach through networking and coalition \nbuilding, and strengthen the Board of Director’s fundraising capacity. His coalition-\nbuilding work brought many beneﬁ ts to New Mexico in the areas of environmental \nhealth and environmental advocacy. In 2004 he convened the New Mexico Environ-\nment and Health Coalition to advocate for statewide programs addressing the impact \nof pollution on the health of New Mexicans. Earl also helped to reinvigorate an envi-\nronmental legislative working group, bringing together environmental advocates from \nall around the state each year to select priority legislation for support by all groups.\nWe wish Allison and Earl all the best in their future endeavors.  \nZ\nthe federal courts to include only waters that are connected with interstate waters. \nBecause many of the water basins in New Mexico are not connected to interstate \nwaters, the State Environment Department has estimated that passage of such \nlegislation would mean that between 20% and 40% of New Mexico’s surface \nwaters could not be protected. \nAll four of the Law Center’s attorneys will be lobbying on these and other items \nduring the legislative session.

Navajo Nation bans uranium mining\nThe Eastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining (ENDAUM), the\nSouthwest Research and Information Center (SRIC) and the Law Center\nsucceeded in educating Navajo lawmakers, who passed a ban on all\nuranium mining and processing in Navajo Indian Country. This is\nthe first tribal law in the country outlawing uranium mining.\n3. NM Supreme Court rules in favor \nof community input\nAlthough the New Mexico Environment Department was mandated by\nthe NM Solid Waste Act to hold public hearings before issuing landfill\npermits, the agency relied completely on technical evidence and disre-\ngarded public tetimony on quality-of-life issues.

This legislation bans conventional uranium mining, such\nas shaft and pit mines, and places a moratorium on uranium processing, which\nincludes ISL mining, in order to protect the Navajo Nation’s water resources. The\ndistinction between conventional uranium mining and processing was made to conform to\nfederal jurisprudence interpreting the authority of states (and by analogy tribes) to regulate\nnuclear materials under the Atomic Energy Act. The DNRPA also imposes civil penalties\non any person violating the terms of the Act, and invokes Navajo traditional law to protect\nthe Nation’s water resources.\nNNuucclleeaarr  RReegguullaattoorryy  CCoommmmiissssiioonn  lliittiiggaattiioonn\nDespite the ban, the struggle to keep the groundwater pristine in Crownpoint and Church\nRock continues. On March 4, ENDAUM and SRIC filed a 1,200 page presentation on\ngroundwater issues, where we again presented compelling technical testimony that HRI’s\nISL mining operations would substantially endanger Crownpoint and Church Rock's\nunderground drinking water sources.\nOn June 4, we filed a brief on radioactive air emissions on behalf of ENDAUM and SRIC.\nIn that brief, we argued that radioactive air emissions from HRI’s ISL operation on Church\nRock Section 17 would impermissibly add to existing radioactive contamination in Church\nRock from past uranium mining. Rather than cleaning up existing radioactive contami-\nnation, the NRC is permitting an entirely new operation that will further irradiate\nChurch Rock's residents.\nFinally, on June 28, we filed a brief on issues relating to the National Environmental Policy\nAct (NEPA). We argued a number of issues in that brief, but in particular we emphasized\nthat the Final Environmental Impact Statement’s (FEIS) justification for the purpose and\nthe need for the HRI project was inadequate. In the FEIS, the NRC concluded that the\npurpose and need in generating the FEIS was to issue a materials license to HRI. Under\nNEPA, this statement of purpose and need is clearly inadequate.\nSSeeccttiioonn  88  SSaaffee  DDrriinnkkiinngg\nWWaatteerr  AAcctt  BBaattttllee\nIn addition to needing its materials license\nfrom the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n(NRC) to conduct mining, Hydro Resources.\nInc. (HRI) also needs two different permits\nrequired by the Safe Drinking Water Act\n(SDWA) before it can begin mining. Before\nthe permits can be issued for its Church\nRock Section 8 mine, however, there must be\na determination about whether New Mexico\nor the federal government and the Navajo\nNation have jurisdiction to issue the permits.\nOn March 3, the New Mexico Secretary of\nthe Environment, Ron Curry, sent a letter to\nthe U.S. EPA asking it to make a determina-\ntion about whether HRI’s Section 8 mine site\nwas “Indian Country.” If Section 8 is deter-\nmined to be Indian Country, the federal\ngovernment and the Navajo Nation will have\njurisdiction under the SDWA. If it is not,\nthen New Mexico will be able to issue\npermits under the SDWA. In the letter, Mr.\nCurry took the position that the State has the\nauthority to issue permits to HRI. The letter\nwas copied to HRI, but not to the Law\nCenter’s clients.\nAAccccoorrddiinngg  ttoo  tthhee    22000000  UU..SS..\nCCeennssuuss,,  9988%%  ooff  CChhuurrcchh RRoocckk’’ss  \nrreessiiddeennttss  aarree  NNaattiivvee AAmmeerriiccaann..\nWhich sovereign has jurisdiction to issue\nHRI permits pursuant to the SDWA is\ncritically important.

In his decision,\nJudge E. Roy Hawkens determined that HRI’s mining operations\nwould not threaten underground sources of drinking water adjacent to\nits mine sites. In other words, Judge Hawkens concluded that HRI\ncould contain its highly toxic mining solution in a discreet area for the\nduration of its operations. The Judge also concluded that HRI could\nrestore the groundwater to “average well field levels” (read “highly\ncontaminated”) and that the water would never migrate to nearby\nunderground sources of drinking water. In many instances, the Judge\nrefused to consider new evidence presented by ENDAUM and SRIC\nin regards to the three remaining minesites, instead applying the deci-\nsions that a former administrative law judge made when ruling on the\nSection 8 minesite in 2004.

The chemical\nplant has operated without a permit under the Air Quality Act since\nthe 1980’s. Some residents who live near the plant believe their chil-\ndren have suffered eye irritation, sore throats, skin rashes, bloody\nnoses and breathing problems as a result of the plant’s operation.\nSince March, the Law Center has been advising and consulting Arturo\nUribe and the citizens of Mesquite as they meet and bargain with\nNMED on the issue of enforcement against Helena Chemical.\nRecently, through the efforts of the Mesquite citizens and the Law\nCenter, NMED issued a compliance order against Helena\nChemical, fined the company nearly $250,000 and ordered it to\nobtain an operating permit.\nBut is it enough?  Already, the company is refusing to pay the fines,\nand bargaining for much less -- the company alleges it should pay only\n$12,000, and that the calculation of damages against them was a \nviolation of constitutional law. A hearing before the Environment\nDepartment is likely the next step. The Law Center will be there \nrepresenting the citizens of Mesquite.\nPPiiccuurriiss  PPuueebblloo  RReeggaaiinnss  MMiinnee  LLaanndd\nSitting in the Mining and Minerals Division (MMD) conference room,\nPicuris Governor Richard Mermejo quietly ended forty years of\nculutral devastation for the members of Picuris Pueblo with a few\nstrokes of his pen. On April 24th, the \npermit and the deed for the mine were transferred to the tribe as the\nresult of a settlement negotiation with\nOglebay Norton, the company that oper-\nated the U.S. Hill mica mine from 1999 to\n2004. Oglebay Norton is now dropped\nfrom the aboriginal title claim.\nAs the new owner of the mine site,\nthe Pueblo faces the challenge of\ncomplying with the New Mexico\nMining Act and reclaiming the land in accor-\ndance with state law and in accordance\nwith cultural needs. A revised closeout\nplan has been submitted to the state\nMining and Minerals Division. The Pueblo is waiting for approval of\nthis plan before beginning reclamation and showing MMD and the\nentire mining community in New Mexico how proper mining\nreclamation should take place.\nAt the same time, the Law Center continues as co-counsel for the\naboriginal title claim against Franklin Minerals, the company that oper-\nated the mine prior to Oglebay Norton.

The City of Albuquerque sent\none-page letters to six apparently randomly selected Pueblos and\nTribes, although more than twenty indigenous nations have spiritual\nand cultural connections with the petroglyph area. No attempts\nwere made to follow up on these letters with phone calls, additional\nletters, or visits with tribal leaders.\nSince July, tribal leaders have been meeting to decide the proper\nformat and conditions for tribal consultation with the City of\nAlbuquerque. The end result is that the extension of Paseo del\nNorte has been delayed pending the approval of the CPRC that the\ncorrect testing data has been collected and that tribal consultation\nhas been adequate.\nRecently, three west side neighborhood associations were allowed to\nintervene on the side of the City, against SAGE Council and other\nplaintiffs that are fighting the extension of the roadway. The City of\nAlbuquerque has filed a motion for summary judgment against the\nplaintiffs arguing that there are no questions of fact in the lawsuit,\nand that the City should win automatically as a matter of law with-\nout going to a jury. The motion for summary judgment was heard\nin the district court in Albuquerque in late August; the Law Center\nand its clients await a decision.\nVVaallllee  VViiddaall::  VVaalllleeyy  ooff  PPuummppjjaacckkss??  \nThe Valle Vidal, near Cimarron, teems with life. In the winter, one\nof the state’s largest elk herds winters in the low-lying vegas, while\nin the summer the lush valley is home to horseback riders, hikers\nand 3,000 Boy Scouts. The Coalition for the Valle Vidal, of which\nthe Law Center is a member, is working to protect the Valle as one\nof New Mexico’s natural treasures. But El Paso Corp. and other\nenergy developers seek to turn the site into an industrial gas zone,\ncomplete with hundreds of miles of pipelines and powerlines, noisy\ncompressor stations and hundreds of pumpjacks. Drilling in the\nValle Vidal could provide as little as eleven hours of our national\nenergy supply.\nBecause the Valle Vidal Unit has never been incorporated into the\nForest Management Plan for the Carson National Forest, the U.S.\nForest Service is now working to amend the plan to include the\nValle. As part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)\nprocess, the Forest Service initiated a public scoping process in June.\nDuring this process, which ended on September 14th, the Forest\nService gave the public an opportunity to provide ideas for the\nscope of issues and alternatives that should be evaluated in the\nDraft Environmental Impact Statement.\nThis summer saw important strides for the Valle campaign. First,\nGovernor Richardson and the NM Dept. of Game and Fish nomi-\nnated the creeks in the Valle Vidal for “Outstanding National\nResource Waters” status, which would protect them fromfuture\ndegradation. Second, Congressman Tom Udall (D-NM) announced \nthat he is developing legislation to permanently protect the site,\nwhile Representative Heather Wilson (R-NM) submitted comments\nto the Forest Service stating that the Valle Vidal should be protected\nfrom drilling. Third, the Coalition has recruited a diverse group of\nspokespeople, including a former NM Oil and Gas Association pres-\nident, to advocate for the protection of the Valle Vidal.

The decision overturned a 2004 ruling by the Water\nQuality Control Commission to dismiss GRIP’s appeal of the\nclosure/closeout plan for the Chino copper mine in Grant County.\nLiterally years in the making, the infamous Chino closure/closeout\nplan was the product of a behind-the-scenes “secret deal” between\nthe Johnson administration and the Phelps Dodge Mining Company,\nwhich owns the Chino mine in southern New Mexico. This plan\ncontained provisions such as the “open pit capture zone” in which\nhundreds of tons of waste rock would not be reclaimed, and the\n“cleaning up” of mine-contaminated water by simply diluting it with\nthousands of acre-feet of potable water.\nThe Water Quality Control Commission refused to hear GRIP’s\nappeal after Phelps Dodge filed a Motion to Dismiss based on tech-\nnicalities. The Court of Appeals unanimously reversed, entitling\nGRIP and the Law Center to now present its case before the\nCommission to determine once and for all if this dirty deal is sound\nand legal. In 2004, the Law Center and GRIP had a tremendous \nvictory on the Tyrone closure/closeout plan before this same\ncommission on similar issues.\n\n\nRecently, the New Mexico Supreme Court made a decision that\nchanges significantly the manner in which communities may participate\nin NMED decision-making procedures concerning proposed solid\nwaste facilities such as landfills. The case involved a landfill, but the\nCourt’s ruling will apply to all solid waste facilities that operate\npursuant to permits issued by the NMED under the State Solid Waste\nAct, and it may influence decision making under other laws as well.\nThe case that was decided in the Supreme Court began with a public\nhearing in Chaparral in early September, 2001. The hearing was\nconducted by the NMED pursuant to the State Solid Waste Act and\nSolid Waste Management Regulations. They require that a public hear-\ning be conducted by the Department whenever it is evaluating whether\nto issue a permit pursuant to the Act, and this hearing addressed\nwhether the Department should issue a permit to Rhino\nEnvironmental Services, Inc. to construct and operate a municipal\nwaste landfill in Chaparral.\nThe hearing was interrupted by the events of September 11th, but\nChaparral residents came to the hearing and expressed their over-\nwhelming opposition to the proposed landfill. They spoke about their\nreasons for coming to Chaparral, which included seeking clean air and\ndrinking water. They also expressed their concerns about Chaparral\nbeing overrun by industrial sites and turned into a dumping ground,\nand their fears that the proposed landfill would bring flies, dust, noise,\ntraffic, and pollution.\nThe NMED Hearing Officer who conducted the hearing let the people\nfrom the community speak, often conducting the hearing into the early\nmorning hours. After voicing the position that NMED has taken for\nyears, the Hearing Officer also made clear that the Department\nwould make its decision based only on technical issues (such as\nthe design of the liner for the landfill), and that concerns\nexpressed by the members of the community would not be taken\ninto account by the Department in determining whether to issue\na permit for the landfill. The Hearing Officer also refused to let a\nmember of the community, Dr. Diana Bustamante of the Colonias\nDevelopment Council, question a witness for the landfill company\nabout the social impact that the landfill would have on the community.\nThe NMED Secretary issued a permit for the landfill, ruling that it was\nappropriate for the Hearing Officer to have told the community\nmembers that their testimony could not influence the ultimate\noutcome, and to have refused to let Dr. Bustamante question the land-\nfill witness on the landfill’s social impact. The Colonias Development\nCouncil appealed the Secretary’s decision to the New Mexico Court of\nAppeals, but that Court affirmed the Secretary’s ruling. The Court of\nAppeals decided that it was proper for the Department to make its\ndecision based only on the technical evidence presented in the hearing,\nand that the Department did not have to take into account the non-\ntechnical opposition to the landfill expressed by members of the\ncommunity.\nThe Colonias Development Council, represented by Nancy Simmons,\na private attorney in Albuquerque, asked the New Mexico Supreme\nCourt to review the case, and the Supreme Court agreed to do so.\nThe Law Center filed a brief on behalf of the South Valley (of\nAlbuquerque) Coalition of Neighborhood Associations  supporting the\nposition of the Colonias Development Council; in addition, Law\nCenter Staff Attorney Rod Ventura participated in the oral argument\nconducted by the Supreme Court. On July 18th, the Supreme Court\nissued its decision, and it is an opinion that will change dramati-\ncally the way that decisions are made pursuant to the Solid \nWaste Act.\nThe Supreme Court pointed out the provisions of the Act and of the\nRegulations that require a demonstration that the proposed landfill\nwould not cause a hazard to public health, welfare, or the environment,\nan undue risk to property, or a public nuisance. The Court also\nemphasized the many provisions of the Act and the Regulations that\ncall for public participation in the process used to determine whether\nto issue a permit for the landfill.\nOn the basis of those considerations, the Court held that the NMED\nSecretary must consider whether the proposed landfill would create a\npublic nuisance or a hazard to public health, welfare, or the environ-\nment. The Court specifically pointed out the testimony of community\nmembers that Chaparral is being overrun by industrial facilities includ-\ning numerous pre-existing landfills, and stated that the Department\nshould consider whether the cumulative impact of pollution, exacer-\nbated by the poverty in the community, could rise to the level of a\npublic nuisance or a hazard to public health, welfare, or the environ-\nment. The Court specifically stated that NMED must take these\nconsiderations into account in reviewing evidence concerning the\nimpact of the landfill on the quality of life in the community.\nThe Supreme Court ordered that the case be sent back to the NMED\nfor another limited hearing. The Court stated that the Colonias\nDevelopment Council would be able to present additional evidence on\nthe impacts of the proliferation of landfills in and around the commu-\nnity. The Court also ordered that the Department allow Dr.\nBustamante to question the landfill company witness about the social\nimpacts of the landfill. The Court indicated as well that the landfill\ncompany would have a reasonable opportunity to respond on behalf of\nthese issues.\nFinally, the Court stated that the NMED Secretary would have to\nexplain his decision following this hearing . The Court pointed out\nthat it was not ruling that the Secretary would have to reach a different\nresult and deny the landfill company’s application, but that it was ruling\nthat the Secretary would have to explain why he decided to reject the\npublic opposition to the landfill if that was his decision.\nThis case marks a significant change in the way that the\nEnvironment Department will make decisions concerning appli-\ncations for permits for solid waste facilities. Since the enactment\nof the Solid Waste Act in 1990, the Environment Department has\ntaken the position that it was limited to considering only technical\nissues in applications for such permits. The Supreme Court has\nchanged that, and has given communities the voice concerning such\napplications and permits that they should have had for the last \nfifteen years.\n--Douglas Meiklejohn, Executive Director\neeXXEECCUUTTIIVVEE  ddIIRREECCTTOORR’’SS  ccOOLLUUMMNN 55\nTThhee  NNeeww  MMeexxiiccoo  SSuupprreemmee  CCoouurrtt  GGiivveess  CCoommmmuunniittiieess  aa  VVooiiccee  \n\n66  LLaaww  CCeenntteerr  NNeewwss\n22000055  NNeeww  MMeexxiiccoo  EEnnvviirroonnmmeennttaall    AAwwaarrddss\nWINNERS OF THE\n2005 NEW MEXICO\nENVIRONMENTAL AWARDS\nKARL SOUDER WATER\nPROTECTION AWARD\nNavajo Councilmember George Arthur\nNavajo activist and SRIC employee Harris Arthur\nEastern Navajo Diné Against Uranium Mining \nFor their work to enact the Diné Natural Resources\nProtection Act, outlawing uranium mining in Navajo Indian\nCountry.

Having spent the summer immersed in environmental justice work\nwith our attorneys, Molly McOwen, Patrick Ferguson and Kimberly Sanchez are now\nbeginning their second year at Columbia Law School in New York City.\nWhat was the most challenging aspect of their jobs this summer?  There is always the steep learning\ncurve, as anyone who has practiced Indian law or atomic licensing law can tell you. But it is how law\ngets put into practice that gave our law clerks pause, rather than the technical aspects of our cases.\n\"Working here, you see how the lawmaking process has an impact on communities,” said Patrick. “The\nerosion of environmentally-protective laws, and the politics behind that phenomenon, really have conse-\nquences for our clients.”\nKimberly remarked that the challenges she saw were similar. “Being a good environmental lawyer is not\njust about lawyering,” she said. “I've learned here that it is just as much about the networks you build\nwith regulators, clients and elected officials.” Another challenge she saw was the difficulty of how to\nprovide the greatest good for the greatest number of people with limited resources.\nWhen asked what the best part of the job was, Molly stated, “the dedication of the people - both those\nwith whom we worked, and the people that we represented this summer.” Our clients' dedication to their\nwork to protect their homes and families has inspired all three of our law clerks to continue for the\npublic interest in the future.

That attention is appropriate because of the seri-\nousness of that contamination and the importance of ground\nwater to New Mexico, a state in which 9 out of 10 people get\ntheir drinking water from ground water. In the 2006 legislative\nsession that begins in January, however, the New Mexico\nLegislature will take up legislation that addresses another\nsignificant problem cause by oil and gas operations, damage to\nthe surface of the ground where oil and gas reserves \ncontinued, next page\nFor more than ten years, the Helena Chemical Corporation\noperated a chemical fertilizer facility in Mesquite (near Las\nCruces) without the proper air quality permit. Thus, there\nwere no parameters or limits in regards to air pollution for\nthe company's facility within the community. Fugitive dust\nfrom fertilizer chemicals affected families whose homes lay\nright outside the Helena boundaries. Children would come\nto school with stinging eyes and throats due to clouds of\nanhydrous ammonia coming down around them.\nFor years, the residents of Mesquite complained about the\nHelena facility. For years nothing was done. Then in\nNovember, 2005, the town's voice was heard and\nbrought results in the form of both a strong air quality\npermit, a side agreement between Mesquite and\nHelena, and a settlement for violation of the State air\nquality act.\nArturo Uribe, one of the leaders of the Mesquite\nCommunity Action Committee (MCAC), lives right next to\nthe Helena facility and hired the Law Center to represent\nMCAC in its struggle for a clean environment.\n“We live in a community of people of four different colors\nwho had not been listened to but are now being listened to,”\nUribe said. “People thought we were crazy, troublemakers.\nBut what our elders have been saying, what my neighbors\nhave been saying has been validated.”\nThrough the efforts of the Law Center and MCAC, a settle-\nment was reached for an air quality permit for the Helena\nfacility which includes conditions that will directly benefit\nMesquite. Furthermore, a permit will require Helena to keep\nrecords, provide regular reports to the New Mexico\nEnvironment Department, perform periodic monitoring and\nbe subject to unannounced inspections.\ncontinued, next page\nThanks to our sponsors \nof our Special Evening\nwith Ted Turner.  \nFind out more on the back page.\nAlso inside: \nour Biannual Report \n““PPeeooppllee  aasskk  mmee  wwhhaatt  wwee’’vvee  ggootttteenn  oouutt  ooff  tthhiiss..

A bill that was sponsored by\nRepresentative Andy Nunez in the 2005 legisla-\ntive session would have provided protection for\nthe owners of lands that include subsurface\nminerals owned by oil and gas companies.\nRepresentative Nunez has first-hand experience\nwith the development of such minerals because\nhis family’s lands were seriously damaged by an\noil and gas operator who was developing miner-\nals located beneath those lands. Representative\nNunez’s legislation, which is expected to be\nintroduced again in the 2006 session, would\nrequire that an oil and gas operator provide\nnotice to the owner of the surface lands , and\nwould mandate that the oil and gas operator\ncompensate the surface owner for\ndamage to the surface\nlands as well as\nfor lost income\nresulting from\nthe oil and\ngas opera-\ntor’s use of\nthe surface\nto access\nminerals. These requirements, which are not in\ncurrent law, would go a long way to protect the\nrights of surface owners whose lands are\nimpacted by the development of subsurface\nminerals.\nWorking with the New Mexico Cattle Growers\nAssociation and the Oil and Gas Accountability\nProject, the New Mexico Environmental Law\nCenter was one of the lead lobbyists for this\nlegislation during the 2005 legislative session,\nwhen House Bill 1015 passed the State House\nof Representatives and ran out of time in the\nState Senate. We expect to be heavily involved\nin the effort to enact similar legislation during\nthe 2006 session, and we look forward to work-\ning with our rancher and other allies on this\nimportant issue.\nPetroglyphs ssetback -- bbut ccase nnot oover\nby Sarah Piltch, Staff Attorney\nThe Law Center filed a lawsuit in February 2005 against the City of Albuquerque to\nstop the proposed extension of Paseo del Norte through the Las Imagines\nArcheological District.\nThis summer, the City of Albuquerque brought a motion for summary judgment,\nalleging that there were no issues of material fact for the court to determine, and\ntherefore the court should make a decision on the law. Law Center clients argued\nthat there were genuine issues of material fact yet to be determined including\nwhether the City's discussion of alternatives was adequate to support a decision to\nbuild the proposed extension--i.e. whether there were prudent and feasible alterna-\ntives to the alternative chosen, whether the alternative chosen would fulfill the\npurpose of the project, whether the City’s environmental impact analysis was\nflawed, whether the City conducted all possible planning to mitigate harm to the\ndistrict, and whether the city must perform a new environmental analysis.\nAfter hearing oral argument on September 2, Judge Vanzi issued her decision on\nthe city's motion for summary judgment on October 11. Although the decision\ndid not end the lawsuit, it constituted a major set-back in the case for Law\nCenter clients.\nJudge Vanzi found that the City acted within the scope of its authority and could\nhave reasonably believed that there was no feasible and prudent alternative, and/or\nthat the other alternative road alignments presented unique problems. However, she\nalso ruled that under the regulations, the city must undergo all possi ble planning to\npreserve and protect and minimize harm to the site.\nAlthough she decided against the plaintiffs on the question of prudent and feasible\nalternatives, Judge Vanzi was troubled by the city’s behavior towards the pueblos.\nSAGE Council has advocated for the city to engage in tribal consultation with all\naffected tribes, particularly before the state Cultural Properties Review Committee.\nMesquite VVictory, CONTINUED\nIn addition, the Law Center helped broker a side agreement between MCAC and\nHelena which provides for regular meetings between the community and the\nindustry to discuss activities at the facility and concerns of the community.\nFinally, because the facility acted out of compliance, it was fined $202,500 by the\nNew Mexico Environment Department. Through efforts from the Law Center and\nMCAC, most of the funds will be distributed directly to the community to\nbenefit Mesquite.\nAs some members of Mesquite have noted, these settlements are only the begin-\nning. MCAC is hoping to look into ground water issues related to the Helena\nfacility.\n“We're watching now and Helena knows, the State knows,” said Uribe. “People ask\nme what we've gotten out of this. The biggest thing, the most important thing is\nthat they’ve listened to us. For once this County and this State have listened to us.”\nSee www.nmenvirolaw.org for more details about the settlement.\nwww.nmenvirolaw.org\n\nCASE UUPDATES 3\nIn her decision, Judge Vanzi noted that “the way in which the record has been presented\nleads the Court to believe there has been little action on the part of the City to substan-\ntively reach out to the Pueblos as sovereign governments, resulting in the appearance of\ninsensitivity to the people who hold the land most sacred.” At this time, our clients are\nweighing their options as to their next step.\nThe fight against Hydro Resources, Inc. (HRI) and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission (NRC) to protect the groundwater in Crownpoint and Church Rock from\nuranium contamination continues. On July 20, the NRC judge presiding over the case, E.\nRoy Hawkens, rejected all of our client’s arguments regarding HRI’s inability to prevent\ncontamination of the Crownpoint and Church Rock water supplies. Essentially, our techni-\ncal experts testified that underground stream channels in the aquifer would prevent HRI\nfrom containing its uranium-contaminated water within its property boundaries, which\nwould result in toxics spreading into adjacent underground sources of drinking water.\nAdditionally, our experts testified that once the groundwater is contaminated, it cannot be\nrestored to pre-mining conditions.\nJudge Hawkens found that HRI’s expert testimony, given by executives and managers in\nthe company, was more credible than the testimony presented by our clients’ expert\nwitnesses. Ironically, shortly before the judge issued his decision, the U.S. Geological\nSurvey published a draft report, commissioned by the NRC, which supports our clients’\nposition that HRI will be unable to remediate the groundwater after mining.\nThe Law Center has appealed this decision and a decision regarding cultural properties to\nthe full Commission.\nLaw CCenter aappeals NNRC ddecisions iin ffavor oof\nuranium ccompany\nby Eric Jantz, Staff Attorney\n““TThhee  wwaayy  iinn  wwhhiicchh  tthhee  rreeccoorrdd  hhaass  bbeeeenn  pprreesseenntteedd  lleeaaddss  tthhee  CCoouurrtt  ttoo\nbbeelliieevvee  tthheerree  hhaass  bbeeeenn  lliittttllee  aaccttiioonn  oonn  tthhee  ppaarrtt  ooff  tthhee  CCiittyy  ttoo  ssuubbssttaannttiivveellyy\nrreeaacchh  oouutt  ttoo  tthhee  PPuueebbllooss  aass  ssoovveerreeiiggnn  ggoovveerrnnmmeennttss,,  rreessuullttiinngg  iinn  tthhee  aappppeeaarr-\naannccee  ooff  iinnsseennssiittiivviittyy  ttoo  tthhee  ppeeooppllee  wwhhoo  hhoolldd  tthhee  llaanndd  mmoosstt  ssaaccrreedd..””\nJJuuddggee  LLiinnddaa  VVaannzzii\nM i s s i o n\nThe New Mexico Environmental Law Center is\na nonprofit, public interest law firm that provides\nfree and low-cost legal services on environmental\nmatters throughout New Mexico.

That year I wrote in the Law\nCenter's newsletter that ‘many Indian tribes…don't feel they can have\nan effect on environmental issues and they feel they are at the mercy of\nthe federal laws and Congress and the administration and the courts\nbecause they don't understand the process. This is where the Law\nCenter-people who are dedicated and who know the process, who are\nexperts and know the language-are so important to Indian tribes and\nother communities….The Law Center enhances the ability of the tribes\nto set up internal mechanisms to develop and use laws for our own\nprotection, to protect our sacred areas, our water, our land and\nanything else of value to the tribe.’\nThose words are as true today as the day I wrote them.\nBut Native American communities are not the only ones that benefit\nfrom the work of the Law Center, and the organization's impact is not\nlocalized to the communities in which the Law Center specifically\nworks. I know that without the Law Center, our water would be more\ncontaminated, our air would be dirtier, our state's residents would be\nsicker, and our ancient cultures would be more damaged. All of us who\nlive in this beautiful, but often shabbily-treated state, benefit from the\nLaw Center's ability to protect the world we share.\nIf you already support the Law Center's work, I thank you for helping\nthis extraordinary group of people continue their work on behalf of\nNew Mexico's communities and environment; the Law Center cannot\noperate without you. If you are new to the Law Center, I urge you to\nbecome a long-time supporter; I am proud to be a part of one of the\noldest and most respected independent environmental organizations in\nNew Mexico, and hope that you will be as well.\nRichard Deertrack\nPresident of the Board of Directors\nNew Mexico Environmental Law Center\nINSTITUTIONAL FUNDERS\nThe Law Center thanks the foundations that supported our work during our 2004\nand 2005 fiscal years.\nBrindle Foundation\nEducational Foundation of America\nEMA Foundation\nFord Foundation\nJoseph and Esther Foster Foundation\nGeneral Service Foundation\nWilliam H. and Mattie Wattis Harris Foundation\nHoughton Mifflin Matching Gift Program\nImpact Fund\nMcCune Charitable Foundation\nNew Cycle Foundation\nNew-Land Foundation\nNew Mexico Community Foundation \nNew Mexico Community Foundation Donor Advised Funds\nRichard and Rachel Fund\nRobert Haspel and Lynda Taylor Fund for Social and Environmental Justice\nNew Mexico Interest On Lawyers' Trust Accounts (IOLTA) Fund,\na program of the Center for Civic Values\nJessie Smith Noyes Foundation\nOppenheimer Brothers Foundation\nPanta Rhea Foundation\nPatagonia Foundation\nPrajna Foundation\nPublic Welfare Foundation\nRacial Justice Collaborative\nRockefeller Family Fund\nSanta Fe Community Foundation \nSanta Fe Community Foundation Donor Advised Funds\nBaebler Fund\nHarold and Norma Brown Fund for the Environment\nHaspel and Taylor Fund for Social and Environmental Justice\nJust Woke Up Fund\nTurn and Return Fund\nSolidago Foundation\nRudolf Steiner Foundation\nSurdna Foundation\nTides Foundation\nTurner Foundation\nFY04 - JULY 1, 2003 - JUNE 30, 2004\nIncome - $659,507\nFoundations - 75.7%\nMajor Donors - 11.5%\nMembership - 5.4%\nFees & Cost Reimbursement - 5.8%\nSpecial Events - 1%\nOther - .6%\nExpenses - $533,985\nGeneral Community Representation - 36.2%\nNative American Comm.

Each of these bills would\nhave prohibited the New Mexico Water Quality\nControl Commission from protecting surface waters\nnot within the federal definition of\n\"waters of the United States\" and from\nadopting or enforcing standards and reg-\nulations for surface water that are more\nstringent than those required by federal\nlaw. Supported by the rapidly growing\ncommercial dairy industry and the New\nMexico Homebuilders Association, these\nbills drew more fire from conservationists of\nall stripes than any others introduced in this\nsession. They were extremely dangerous\nbills in light of the Bush Administration's\nrollbacks of federal regulations and defini-\ntions of what categories of surface water\nwill be regulated at all by the federal gov-\nernment. In an ideological shift that should\nhave been embarrassing, conservative\nRepublicans abandoned their 'state's rights'\nmantra and championed the federal govern-\nment as their savior.\nIf either of these bills had passed, between 20% and\n40% of New Mexico's surface water would have been\ncompletely unprotected and vulnerable to pollution from any\nand all sources.\nFortunately, each of these bills died. SB 583 was\nkilled in the Senate Judiciary Committee after\nintense lobbying by the Law Center and dozens of\nother organizations. House Bill 711 was also the\nsubject of intense lobbying, and it died its own well-\ndeserved death in the House Judiciary Committee.\nOn the flip side, numerous bills introduced by envi-\nronmental interests met similar fates due to opposi-\ntion by commercial and industrial interests, and a\nfew good bills actually made it through the legisla-\ntive meat grinder and are on their way to the\nGovernor's desk. The casualties included:\nHB 722 and SB 710 - Healthy Communities Act\n- would have given strong protection from further\npollution to communities that already have more\npolluting facilities than they can count;\nHB 1004 - Air Quality Control Act Requirements\n- and SB 668 -Stringency of Hazardous Waste\nAct Rules - would have stripped the 'no more strin-\ngent than federal standards' language out of both\nthe NM Air Quality and Hazardous Waste Acts,\nthereby allowing NM to decide how much protec-\ntion to afford communities and the environment\nrather than having to follow the Bush\nAdministration's environmental rollbacks.

We represent the South Valley Coalition of\nNeighborhood Associations, the SouthWest Organizing Project, and\nseveral individuals who have fought this expansion for nearly a decade.\nOur clients are concerned that an expansion would contaminate\ngroundwater and threaten the safety of local residents, and that the\nlandfill’s existence in the South Valley is representative of the tremen-\ndous environmental injustice perpetrated on the residents of the\nSouth Valley, the majority of whom are Hispanic.\nIn 2003, the Bernalillo County Commissioners granted the landfill a\npermit to expand from 80 acres to 140 acres. They did this  in spite\nof county regulations prohibiting the expansion of private landfills in\n“groundwater crucial areas” (areas containing current or potential\ndrinking water supplies), and with flagrant disregard to the decisions\nagaint the expansion that were issued by County staff and the\nBernalillo County Extraterritorial Land Use Commission.\nThe Law Center appealed in December 2003. Judge Linda Vanzi of\nthe Second District Court of New Mexico agreed with our argument\nthat the permit violates crucial area regulations, and ordered the per-\nmit revoked. Southwest Landfill has appealed, and we will head back\nto court this spring to defend our victory.\nMMaajjoorr  VViiccttoorriieess  iinn  PPiiccuurriiss  PPuueebblloo  \nMMiiccaa  CCaassee\nI\nn February, 2004, the Law Center and our co-counsel filed an abo-\nriginal title claim on behalf of Picuris Pueblo for land on which an\nindustrial mica mine is sited. The land, sacred to the Picuris People\nbecause of its micaceous clay deposits, was sold by the US govern-\nment during the 1950s under the auspices of the federal 1872 Mining\nLaw. Maintaining\nthat it never\nextinguished its\ntitle to the land,\nthe Pueblo is ask-\ning a federal court\nfor the return of\nthe land as well as\nmonetary damages.\nBy the summer of\n2004, Oglebay\nNorton, the mine\noperator since 1998, was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, litigating the title\nclaim, and facing opposition from the Pueblo as well as neighboring\ncommunities. Oglebay Norton shut down the mine and its asso-\nciated mill in Velarde on September 1. The Pueblo is currently\npursuing settlement negotiations with Oglebay Norton.\nThe aboriginal title claim contin-\nues against the previous mine\noperator, Tennessee-based\nFranklin Minerals. On March 11,\n2005, the U.S. District Court\nheard oral arguments on Franklin\nMineral's Motion to Dismiss\nPicuris Pueblo's claim against the\nmining company. Franklin\nMinerals argued that the United\nStates has to be a party to this\naction because the case revolves\naround mining patents and abo-\nriginal claims to land. Franklin\nalso argued that if the Picuris\nwere successful in its claim, it\ncould question the validity of all\nmining patents under the 1872 Mining Act. Franklin asked District\nCourt Judge Robert Brack to dismiss the Picuris' lawsuit.\nRichard Hughes, our co-counsel from the firm of R othstein, Donatelli,\nHughes, Dahlstrom & Schoenburg, argued that predecessors in title,\nsuch as the U.S. government, are never proper parties in a land claim\nissue. He asserted that if this were the case, then land claim cases in\nthe United States would have to include claims against Lord\nBaltimore, monarchs of England, or ancient Spanish rulers.\nLAST MINUTE UPDATE: On March 31, we learned that Judge\nBrack threw out Franklin’s Motion to Dismiss.With this \nvictory under our belts, we will proceed to court with the title claim.\nVVaallllee  VViiddaall  pprroocceessss  BBeeggiinnss\nT\nhe U.S. Forest Service is seeking to amend the Forest Plan for the\nCarson National Forest, in order to determine future land use for\nthe Valle Vidal, a unit of the Carson National Forest near the\nColorado border. The Valle, which is a winter home to New Mexico’s\nlargest elk herd and a summer home to 3,000 Boy Scouts from\nPhilmont Scout Ranch, is adjacent to Ted Turner’s Vermejo Park\nRanch, where El Paso Corp. has been drilling for several years.\nThe Law Center is a member of the Coalition for the Valle Vidal, a\ngroup knit together from concerned individuals, conservation and\nsportsmen’s groups, businesses, and local governments and chambers\nof commerce. Since 2003, the Coalition has educated New Mexicans\nabout the impacts that gas drilling will have on the Valle, including\nhabitat fragmentation, air and water pollution, damage from roads and\nwellpads, traffic and compressor noise.\n2  CASE  UPDATES\nRight, Picuris protest of the mine in 2002; in the foreground is mica-\nceous pottery [S. Knox]  Above, the mine in 1999 [Lighthawk]\nw w w . n m e n v i r o l a w . o r g\n\nCASE  UPDATES 3\nStill, it is no surprise that the Coalition has been labelled “obstruction-\nist” by drilling advocates. Here is the Coalition’s rebuttal:\nAlready 88% of natural gas reserves occurring on federal lands in\nthe Rocky Mountain West are available for leasing and development.\nOf the 2.6 million acres in the Raton Basin, we are working to pro-\ntect 40,000 acres of land that was given to the American People\nbecause of its spectacular beauty and critical habitat. The Valle hosts\nmore than 100 species of animals, including the endangered Rio\nGrande cutthroat trout, and is ranked as one of the best horseback\nriding and camping sites in the country.\nUsing figures provided by the Forest Service, experts at the Oil and\nGas Accountability Project estimate that the Valle Vidal would yield\nbetween 11 and 36 hours of the national gas supply -- hardly enough\nto make a dent in our foreign energy dependence.\nDrilling advocates point to Vermejo Park as a model of environmen-\ntally-sensitive drilling, but this claim has not been scientifically or\notherwise independently substantiated. The Coalition concedes that\nconditions may better at Vermejo Park than on public lands, but\nnotes that the landowner is a billionaire who has the legal muscle to enact\nstrict covenants and full-time staff to monitor and enforce conditions.\nThis winter, the Forest Service has held public “open houses” across\nnorthern New Mexico, as it prepares for the scoping process. During\nthe scoping process, the Forest Service will solicit comments about\nwhat the public wants to see in the Valle Vidal in the future. Scoping\nshould last through the summer of 2005, and then the Forest Service\nwill begin the studies needed for an environmental impact statement.\nThe Law Center encourages its members to provide comments to the\nForest Service during this process.

We cannot appeal this decision\nuntil Phase II of litigation is completed, and HRI cannot begin mining\nuntil it acquires an \"aquifer exemption\" that affirms that the area to be \ncontaminated will not be used for drinking water. Our computer mod-\neling shows that there is a high likelihood that contamination will\nmigrate towards underground sources of drinking water, however.\nWe have begun Phase II of litigation, in which we will try to invalidate\nthe licenses for the remaining three proposed mines on the grounds\nthat the mines will contaminate air and groundwater. We anticipate\nthat this phase of the case will take between 12 and 18 months. If the\nNRC agrees with us, and revokes HRI's licenses, we will likely appeal\nthe license for Section 8. If the NRC rules against us, as we anticipate,\nwe will likely appeal the entire project in federal court.\nIn addition to our work in the NRC proceeding, we are working with\nour clients to pass legislation on the Navajo Nation that would ban \ntraditional uranium mining techniques, and place a moratorium on in\nsitu leach mining. We are also heading  to court to defend the health-\nbased uranium groundwater standard adopted by the state of New\nMexico in 2004.\nOur work on this case is more urgent - and difficult - than ever because\nthe price of uranium has more than doubled in the past two years to\nnearly $22/lb. HRI has stated that uranium must fetch a minimum\nprice of $17/lb. in order to mine. For the last ten years, the price had\nnot met that threshold; now, however, mining would be a profitable\nventure.\nTo review the timeline: HRI applied for its licenses in 1988. The NRC\ngranted the company licenses for four mines in 1997. In 1998, our\nclients were granted “intervernor status,” and allowed to participate in\nthe proceeding. In 2001, we completed litigation of Section 8; the\nHearing Officer issued his decision in 2004. Our appeal was denied in\n2005. We are now in Phase II of litigation, regarding the licenses for\nthe remaining three mines.\nfigures from the Ux Consulting Co. website, 3/8/05\n\nI\nn February, Dharma Master Hsin Tao, a Taiwanese\nBuddhist master and the founder of the Museum\nof World Religions visited Las Imagines Archeological\nDistrict on the west side of\nAlbuquerque as a guest of\nSAGE Council, one of the\nLaw Center's clients. The\nMaster came to honor and\nbless the area. We walked\nwith the Master as he hiked\nup the mesa. We stood at\nthe edge of the mesa, look-\ning at the storm coming in.\nThis area, the Las Imagines\nArchaeological District, is a\nvolcanic escarpment stretching 17 miles along\nAlbuquerque's West Mesa escarpment. It contains\na gallery of an estimated 25,000 prehistoric Indian\nand historic Hispanic petroglyphs. Early Pueblo\nIndian residents began using this area for tradition-\nal and cultural purposes between A.D. 1300 and\nA.D. 1650, which included the carving of petro-\nglyphs into the volcanic rock. The place remains\nspiritually, traditionally, and culturally significant to\nmany Native Americans today.\nWe drove with the visitors\nto Las Imagines. \"This is\nAmerica's sacred place,\" said\none of the Buddhists on the\nbus. We laughed because we\nwere passing a golf course.\nBut we weren't sure he was\njoking.\nThree months ago, the City\nof Albuquerque won a bond\nelection which would allow\n$8.7 million in bond money\nfor the extension of Paseo\ndel Norte through Las Imagines Archaeological\nDistrict. The bond question on the ballot asked for\n$52 million of bonds for the improvement of\nAlbuquerque streets. It did not specifically mention\nextending Paseo del Norte through Las Imagines\nArchaeological District. On election night, Mayor\nMartin J. Chavez said that \"barring lawyers,\" construc-\ntion will begin through this area in early 2005.\nTwo weeks ago, on February 17, 2005, the New\nMexico Environmental Law Center filed a lawsuit in\nNew Mexico District Court on behalf of SAGE\nCouncil, the Sierra Club, the New Mexico\nArchaeological Council, and seven other plaintiffs\nrequesting that the City of Albuquerque stop all planning, funding, and further con-\nstruction of Paseo del Norte through Las Imagines Archeological District.\nThe Master was told that this was a sacred place, and he lay flat on the ground. He said\nhe was feeling its energy. If it were anyone else, it would\nhave seemed funny. But for him, it just seemed to work.\nThe fact that he was a Buddhist, and Taiwanese, and came\nto honor this place, was not lost on any of us.\nNineteen years ago, Las Imagines was placed on the state\nregister of cultural properties. Three years later, the New\nMexico legislature passed a law making it illegal to “use” a\ncultural property such as Las Imagines in the way the City\nwants to use it for the extension of this road. This simple\npremise is the basis of the\nlawsuit.\nAs of this writing, we have\nyet to hear the City's\nresponse to our lawsuit, we\nhave yet to face a judge, and\nwe have yet to have a deci-\nsion. All these things will\nplay out in time.\nAnd over time, the City of\nAlbuquerque continued to\ngrow. As one stands on top\nof the mesa in Las Imagines,\none can almost literally look straight down and see\nthe city which has grown towards its boundaries. It\nmay have been seven hundred or so years ago that\nPueblo Indians began gathering here and marking\nthe petroglyphs we still see today, but the City of\nAlbuquerque wants to go through here NOW .\nLooking at the petroglyphs and the volcanic rock\nand even watching a Buddhist master move among\nthem, it is easy to imagine the ancient significance\nof this place by its proximity and location to the\nmountains, the river, the volcanoes. But the here\nand now is also what gets lost in debate over Paseo\ndel Norte. Today, the cultural significance of the site remains important. Today, Native\nAmericans continue to use this site, and not just individual petroglyphs at the site, in\nceremonial ways. Today local residents use this protected area as a place for recreation.\nToday archaeologist continue to find new knowledge about the area. Today, Las\nImagines Archaeological District remains on the State Register of Cultural Properties.\nBut what is foremost in our mind is the Mayor declaring that \"construction will begin in\nearly 2005.\"  Two weeks ago, we filed suit against the City to stop construction. And\nnow we stand at the edge of the mesa looking at the storm coming in.\nTop: Laurie Weahkee of SAGE Council discusses the threat with Hsin Tao and his associates.

We provided\nadvice to 16 requestors,\nand took on 11 new\ncases.\nAs you have no doubt noticed, the format\nand size of this issue of The Green Fire\nReport are different from previous issues.\nThe reason for that is the Law Center's\nneed to cut expenses wherever possible\nbecause of the reductions in funding pro-\nvided to the Law Center by foundations.\nSince September 11, 2001, many founda-\ntions have experienced serious losses in\nthe stock market where they had much of\ntheir assets invested.  One extreme exam-\nple is provided by a national foundation\nthat has provided substantial funding to\nthe Law Center and other groups in New\nMexico; that foundation has lost a total of\nabout four fifths of the assets that it had\nprior to September 11th.\nThe losses experienced by foundations\nthat support the Law Center have had a\ndirect impact on our budget,  resulting in\na prediction that the Law Center will be\nfacing a deficit of more than $100,000 for\nthe fiscal year that ends on June 30, 2004.\nThere are only two positive points about\nthese developments.  The first is that we\nare being forced to develop new sources\nof funding and new ways of saving\nmoney.  Despite the circumstances that\nare forcing us to take those actions, they\nare productive measures that will serve\nthe Law Center well in the future.  \nThe second positive point is that the\nfoundations' difficulties are not affect-\ning the Law Center as badly as they\nwould have half a dozen years ago\nbecause we have reduced our depend-\nence on foundation funding.  When we \nbegan a cam paign to reduce the Law\nCenter's reliance on foundations in 1998,\nabout 85% of the Law Center's funding\nwas provided by foundations.  We have\nreduced that amount to less than 70% of\nour funding.  If we had not made that\nprogress, the deficit we are facing would\nhave been considerably worse.       \nEven so, the deficit we are facing could\nforce staff reductions in 2004.

SAGE is\nnow looking toward the upcoming legisla-\ntive session and anticipating the introduc-\ntion of bills proposing state funding for\nthe city project.\nAlbuquerque has never complied with the\nNew Mexico Prehistoric and Historic\nSites Preservation Act which requires the\ncity to show that there are no prudent and\nfeasible alternatives to the Paseo del\nNorte project.  In fact, the city approved\nrecent developments with full knowledge\nthat the developments would be built\nacross at least one of the identified alter-\nnatives.

It's different now, because I played ‘Traitors’ at a point in my quote, unquote, career where I'm a known person, and so you have to manage and deal with that as well. I think those are the biggest differences.”\n“Boston Rob” ended up being eliminated as a traitor in his season, but when asked if he would go back and do anything different, he says you have to “play the hand you’re dealt.”\n“I don’t know if I would do anything different. It's like you have to play the hand you're dealt, and that's the biggest thing on both the shows. Like, you adapt to different situations, and just know that sometimes you'll be able to do something about it, and other times you can't.”\nHe continued, “Like, to me, in the moment with Bob the Drag Queen, I felt like in that moment, I had to go get him. In hindsight, looking back, maybe I could have waited, but like, why take that chance? That's the way I play. I play an aggressive style, and when it works, it works, and when it doesn't, it doesn't. But I sleep well at night after.”\nBut if he had the chance to go back would he want to be a traitor again? “I don’t know. It’d be kind of nice to see what it’s like on the other side.”\n“The Traitors” season 1 winner Cirie Fields has some wise words for the season 4 cast: “Less is more. You don’t have to be the chief. Be an Indian. The Indians go way farther in the game of ‘Traitors.’” She continues, “You want to be invisible. Those who are seen get banished.”\nWhen it comes to whose game she’s most excited to see play out, she said, “I think Natalie Anderson. She won ‘Survivor,’ but she’s kind of like a low-key type. She’s the perfect person to be a traitor.”\nCirie continues, “She [Natalie] gives off those trustworthy vibes. She doesn't have to be in the forefront. She's a great competitor. I think she has a great strategic mind. I could be predicting the next ‘Traitors’ winner, because there hasn't been one since myself.”\nSo what does it take to win “The Traitors” as a traitor? “’The Traitors’ is balance. Knowing when to talk, when not to talk, knowing when to shine and when not to shine, and being authentic especially in a game like ‘Traitors,’ where the paranoia is high and people are trying to sniff out fakeness.”\nNow, if “RuPaul’s Drag Race” winner, Bob the Drag Queen, were to return to the castle, he said, “I would go back on the show and honestly, I would do what I did. I had a lot of fun on the show.”\nHe continued, “Could I go in there and be quiet? Yeah, but I wouldn't be having fun.”\nBob’s “Sibling Rivalry” podcast host, and also a former “Drag Race” winner, Monét X Change, is set for season four, and when asked if he gave his BFF any advice, he quickly replied, “No.” Then added, “I didn’t do that well so would you ask me for advice?”\nHonestly, that’s a fair point, Bob!\n“Real Housewives of Atlanta” alum Phaedra Parks, would return to the show “in a New York minute.” Adding, “I love ‘The Traitors’ it was my most favorite television job I’ve ever had.”\nWhen it comes to who she’s most excited to watch in the upcoming season, “Skater guy. [Johnny] Weir. I think he’s gonna be hilarious.”\nShe continues, “Of course, I want to see my girl Dorinda [Medley] come back. Of course, ‘frick and frack,’ Porsha [Williams] is on there. You know, all of the housewives will definitely bring the fashion.”\nShe concludes, saying, “Kelce’s, his mom Like, what is that about?”\nThis refers to the season four casting of Travis and Jason Kelce’s mother, Donna Kelce.\nIt’s sure to be a wild and turbulent season, and we can’t wait for it!“The Traitors” premieres Thursday, Jan. 8, on Peacock.\nFollow us @tnndentertainment on Instagram.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "946841e0fdcd0606402ddee6563cb2fdf2f217cb888f9e2d2d2c78be617d2936", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_news_entertainment_boston-rob-cirie-fields-phaedra-parks-reveal-who-theyre-excited-to-see-on-traitors-mariano-bob-the-drag-.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

(TNND) — The FBI announced on Friday that it thwarted a \"potential terrorist attack\" inspired by ISIS on New Year's Eve in North Carolina.\nChristian Sturdivant, 18, of Mint Hill, was arrested and charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He faces a statutory maximum of 20 years in prison, but officials said the sentence will depend on several factors.\nThe bureau reported Sturdivant was allegedly planning to wear a Kevlar vest and use knives and hammers to attack people at a grocery store and fast food restaurant.\nSturdivant first came under the FBI radar in January 2022 when he was still a juvenile, according to the FBI. He was in contact on social media with an unidentified ISIS member overseas.\nSpecial Agent in Charge James Barnacle explained that Sturdivant received direction from the unidentified ISIS member to dress in all black, knock on people's doors and attack them with a hammer. He was allegedly stopped by his grandfather.\nFollowing that attempt, Barnacle said he was referred for psychological care and reportedly no longer had access to social media, but a week before Christmas, the Charlotte Field Office learned it wasn't true.\nOn Dec. 18, the FBI received information that a person on social media was making posts supporting ISIS and extremist ideology, officials detailed at a news conference. Sturdivant reportedly communicated on Dec. 12 to an undercover agent that he \"will do jihad soon\" and was a \"soldier of the state.\"\nThe criminal complaint alleges that Sturdivant sent the undercover agent a picture of two hammers and a knife, claiming he was planning to purchase a firearm to use in the potential act.\nAdditionally, Sturdivant allegedly sent the undercover agent a voice recording of Sturdivant pledging “Bayat,” a loyalty oath to ISIS.\nWhen agents became aware of his messages, they said law enforcement used a warrant on Dec. 29 to search Sturdivant's home and found handwritten papers, one labeled \"New Years Attack 2026,\" which listed a vest, mask, tactical gloves and knives. The plan, according to the FBI, described him wanting to stab as many people as possible, up to 20 to 21.\nThe note also included a section labeled as “martyrdom op,” describing a plan to attack police responding to the site of the attack so Sturdivant would die a martyr.\n\"This investigation highlights the very real threat posed by people who self-radicalize online and are inspired by jihadist ideologies espoused by foreign terrorist organizations. They seek to attack soft targets with easily accessible weapons and with little to no warning,\" Barnacle said. \"To further complicate this threat, we have seen that most successful attackers radicalize in a time span between one and four years, and they typically mobilize to act in less than three months.\"\nOfficials said he made his first appearance in court in Charlotte and is currently in federal custody, pending a hearing on Jan. 7.\nRuss Ferguson, the United States Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, said it wasn't Sturdivant's intention to work alone, and he believed he was working directly with ISIS but was talking with two different undercover agents.\nSeveral agencies were involved in apprehending Sturdivant, including the New York Police Department, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, Matthews Police Department, the Mint Hill Police Department and multiple federal agencies.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "dca92cb62f9d62880b0e233908fc893ee4b3f46f50d0bcffab8ad4148f673d90", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_news_nation-world_fbi-thwarts-potential-terrorist-attack-on-new-years-eve-in-nc-inspired-by-isis-islamic-state-christian-st.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

It also stated that her address in the document had a missing space or unit number.\nThe New Mexico State Police had previously reported that Arriaga was arrested after allegedly driving drunk and crashing a 2007 purple Dodge Charger in August, resulting in the deaths of a 15-year-old and a 12-year-old, including her own daughter.\nNew Mexico State Police officials also confirmed that the 12-year-old was the daughter of Escobedo Arriaga.\nAnother 15-year-old was injured but survived.\nThe crash happened at around 6:50 p.m. in the area of 8100 Highway 478.\nNMSP said the Dodge Charger flew off the roadway, hit a light pole, a chain-link fence, and a tree before coming to a crashing stop on the front yard of a home.\nHome surveillance video appears to have caught the moments before the tragic crash.\nRELATED: Charges dismissed against mother in deadly Vado crash due to court procedural errors\nNMPS said the two kids were pronounced dead on the scene by the Office of the Medical Investigator, while Arriaga and a second 15-year-old passenger were taken to the hospital.\nInvestigators said the contributing factors in the crash and the deaths were alcohol and improper seatbelt use, adding that the surviving 15-year-old appeared to have been using his seatbelt properly.\nArriaga was originally charged with:\n- Two counts of Homicide by Vehicle (Driving While Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor or Any Drug)\n- One count of Great Bodily Harm by Vehicle (Driving While Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor or Any Drug)\n- Two counts of Intentional Abuse of a Child Resulting in Death\n- One count of Abuse of a Child Resulting in Great Bodily Harm\n- One count of Driving While Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor\nSign up to receive the top interesting stories from in and around our community once daily in your inbox.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "6ed441fa4627c4385ae6337958975a97bb524b828b82d8ebaaff8fa10db62499", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_news_local_mothers-case-in-deadly-vado-crash-reopened-after-court-procedure-violation.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

Jim Walsh said his personal review of public documents and social media videos leads him to believe there is a potential misuse of funds at publicly subsidized child care facilities.\n“The Attorney General has flubbed it early in the process here,” said Walsh, (R) Aberdeen, who is also the State GOP chair, in an interview at the Capitol on New Year’s Day. “This is a systemic problem, in my opinion, of how our state bureaucratic agencies are running the child care subsidy programs.”\nThe issue flared up in the past week after a social media influencer suggested, in a viral video, that multiple Minnesota-based Somali-run day care centers that received public funding were closed or had no children on site. That led to others, in Washington state, making similar claims.\nRELATED: WA State Rep: Bill would strengthen oversight of private day cares receiving public funds\nWhile Walsh says “one always has to be wary of the greater context,” and he’s not aware of any criminal investigation, there is enough that he’s seen to encourage the Attorney General to take a harder line when looking for fraud.\n“This is significant money. Put it all together, and it isgetting into the billions. It's a lot of money that the state of Washington is paying child care providers with not enough accountability for how that money is being spent, where it's being spent, and that's the empowering part of this controversy, and I think some private citizens are seeing that they can do something,” he said.\nOn Wednesday, Attorney General Nick Brown’s office acknowledged that formal complaints had been filed, responding in a statement, “We (and other state entities) are receiving harassment complaints and fraud complaints. We are in the process of going through them and do not have a specific number to provide.\nWe have a longstanding policy of not answering questions about potential investigatory matters. Our office has several tools to address fraud depending on the nature of what is alleged, but the state DSHS is the primary state agency that handles fraud allegations against childcare providers. In general, if there were a potential conflict of interest between the AGO representing different state parties with truly adverse positions, the office would ensure necessary screening and separation of functions.”\nRepresentative Travis Couture told KOMO News on Wednesday that he’s already filed a bill calling for a third-party review of private entities receiving public funds.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "a6b4cb299244ff6263ccaa9aa07f0eb22c835baf5e716e0828fa6f075039b78e", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_news_nation-world_gop-chair-fraud-concerns-public-documents-capitol-new-years-day-child-care-facilities-funding-day-cares-m.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

Mamdani also nullified an executive order which adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, which consists of 11 examples of antisemitism in action, seven of which include criticisms of Israel.\nThe Israel Foreign Ministry took to social media to express its disdain with Mamdani.\n“On his very first day as New York City Mayor Mamdani shows his true face: He scraps the IHRA definition of antisemitism and lifts restrictions on boycotting Israel,” Israel’s Foreign Ministry wrote in a post.\n“This isn’t leadership. It’s antisemitic gasoline on an open fire.”\nHowever, not all Jewish organizations share the Israeli’s disdain for Mamdani’s decision to roll back Adams’ executive orders.\n“There is not consensus necessarily around whether the I.H.R.A. definition of antisemitism should be codified in this way,” Phylisa Wisdom, the executive director of the New York Jewish Agenda, a progressive group, told the New York Times. “Not everyone thinks you need to codify I.H.R.A to keep the Jewish people safe, in the same way we don’t necessarily have codified definitions of other forms of hate.”\nMamdani also revoked Executive Order 61, which mandated that the New York Police Department strengthen its protection around synagogues in the wake of growing harassment and threats from protesters. The order included a directive ensuring the establishment of safe zones which prohibits protests from occurring within a certain distance of sites of religious worship.\nHowever, Mamdani ensured that his administration remained focused on protecting Jewish New Yorkers by pointing to “the continued incorporation of the Office to Combat Antisemitism.”\n“That is an issue that we take very seriously and as part of the commitment that we’ve made to Jewish New Yorkers: to not only protect them, but to celebrate and cherish them,” Mamdani told reporters.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "7bfe2ef31a73364fb079b277a0f63becd63898423b4696c691965f470916a042", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_news_nation-world_nyc-mayor-mamdani-faces-backlash-for-revoking-antisemitism-orders-by-predecessorzohran-mamdani-israeli.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

ASU finishes 2025 at 8-5.\nAt halftime, Duke led 28-24. It was the highest scoring first half in Sun Bowl history. In the third quarter, Nate Sheppard rushed for a 3-yard touchdown to put the Blue Devils up by 10. However, ASU stormed right back as they had all afternoon. Jeff Sims connected with Khamari Anderson for an 8-yard score to cut the Duke lead down to four. In the fourth quarter, Sims hit Malik McClain for 6-yard touchdown to put ASU back on top 39-35.

Fans from both sides have poured into the Borderland and the anticipation is rising for a game that features two programs trending sharply upward, each looking to close its season with a statement victory on a national stage.\nArizona State enters the Sun Bowl with an 8–4 record and an opportunity to secure its 20th win over the past two seasons. For head coach Kenny Dillingham and the Sun Devils, the bowl game represents another step toward their long-term goal of establishing ASU as one of college football’s premier programs.\n\"Four or five years from now hopefully these things that would be milestones and really good accomplishments slowly become somewhat expected,\" Dillingham said.\nOn the opposite sideline, Duke arrives in El Paso fresh off a historic season. The Blue Devils navigated adversity throughout the year, showing resilience during both highs and lows before ultimately coming together to claim their first outright conference championship in 63 years. Now, Duke has its sights set on putting an exclamation point on its remarkable season.\n\"It is a showing of our program on the up and up,\" Duke wide receiver Cooper Barkate said. \"It would be huge for us. The ACC championship was a bit of a surprise but tremendous. Going out and beating a team that was ranked all season would be a big win. \"\n\"Failure is not final,\" Duke head coach Manny Diaz said. \"The best teams use failure as a great teacher and that is what we have learned.\"\nDepth will be a key storyline for Arizona State, as the Sun Devils are expected to lean on several young and inexperienced players.\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Dillingham said. \"We recruited those guys to play football and it's time to go play football. Let's have fun, play hard, do your job and fly around out there.\"\nAt the center of ASU's bowl chances is redshirt senior quarterback Jeff Sims, who took over midway through the season for an injured Sam Leavitt.\n\"I am happy he chose to stay here and got that opportunity,\" Dillingham said. \"I'm happy to see really good people get an opportunity to perform and that is what he has done. He gets one more shot to do it [Wednesday] and I am going to do everything in my power to make sure he has the best game he's played in college football.\"\n\"Jeff has stepped up in a leadership role and with camaraderie with the guys,\" ASU wide receiver Derek Eusebio said, \"He was always ready and not down when he wasn't playing. Us behind him is just a testament to him and his work.\"\nFor Sims, it is crucial he avoids turning the ball over which has been the achilles heel of his college career.\nDuke’s offense is led by quarterback Darian Mensah, one of the top signal callers in the ACC and a player who gives the Blue Devils confidence every time he steps onto the field.\n\"Darian is such a good fit at Duke because he prepares with immense humility and plays with superior confidence,\" Diaz said. \"That's what we explain to our guys. You prepare like you've never one and play like you've never lost.\"\nDillingham had high praise for Mensah and emphasized the necessity for his defense to create pressure.\n\"If you can't get to the quarterback rushing four, you have to send more,\" he said. \"Send the fifth guy. If you can't get there with five, better send six because this is an NFL quarterback. We have to make him uncomfortable.\"\nAmid preparations for the Sun Bowl, both teams have also had the opportunity to experience El Paso and embrace the culture of the 915.\nEarlier on Tuesday, ASU players made a special stop at El Paso Children’s Hospital, where they spent time with patients, handed out toys, and shared moments of joy with children fighting some very tough battles.\nWhile the visit was intended to bring smiles to the kids’ faces, the Sun Devils say they were ultimately the ones inspired — moved by the strength, resilience, and courage they witnessed throughout the hospital.\n\"It is an unbelievable blessing,\" ASU offensive lineman Ben Coleman said. \"You talk about real world problems, we aren't the brave ones as football players. We have the easy job. These kids are the brave ones and the stuff they are going through is truly inspiring. The strength that they show and to still wake up and have a smile is super inspiring.\"\nKickoff is on Wednesday is at 12pm at the Sun Bowl.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "01f54c65102e9599cefea487efbf7e197f4c5b8944c746af17ccaa0a0fb1c3ca", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_news_local_previewing-the-92nd-sun-bowl.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

That life is rooted in Ohio, specifically Yellow Springs, a small town that has become central to both his personal story and his public identity.\nDave Chappelle’s Childhood Ties to Ohio Explained\nChappelle’s connection to Ohio dates back to childhood. After his parents divorced, he spent most of the year in Maryland with his mother, but summers with his father in Yellow Springs. Those early memories stayed with him long after fame arrived.\nDuring a 2017 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” he described Yellow Springs, population roughly 3,700, as a hippie town where crystals and tie-dye are common and called it “a Bernie Sanders island in a [Donald] Trump sea.”\n“Everybody knows me. It’s like The Simpsons, you see the same people every day, and I’m like the local ‘Krusty the clown,’” Chappelle joked.\nWATCH: Dave Chappelle Spoke Up at a Town Hall in Ohio\nWhy Dave Chappelle Chose Ohio Over Hollywood\nAfter walking away from “Chappelle’s Show” and a reported $50 million Comedy Central deal in 2005, the comedian returned to Ohio full-time. He now lives on a 39-acre farm with his wife, Elaine, and their three children, Sulayman, Ibrahim, and Sanaa. Chappelle has said the move gave his family a sense of normalcy he couldn’t find elsewhere.\nIn a 2017 interview with Gayle King on “CBS This Morning,” he compared his life in Ohio to a sanctuary. “It’s like a nature reserve where they let me roam free. I’m a protected commodity here,” he said.\nRELATED: Dave Chappelle among 130 comics announced for Netflix stand-up festival\nFrom Netflix Specials to Town Halls: Chappelle’s Ohio Impact\nOhio frequently finds its way into Chappelle’s comedy as well. In several Netflix specials, he jokes about growing up as a minority around “poor white people” in Ohio and later addresses the state’s drug crisis in “Dave Chappelle: Sticks & Stones.”\nHis affection for the state was on full display during his 2018 episode of “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman,” where he toured Yellow Springs and reflected on its unchanged character.\n“This place hasn’t changed in 100 years. It’s aesthetically almost identical. I remember walking and getting groceries here with my dad,” Chappelle told Letterman. He also shared local lore about the town’s spring, saying, “The local legend is, if you drink from the spring, you’ll always come back to this place.”\n“Have you ever drank anything out of the spring?” Letterman asked.\n“Clearly, I have drank a lot,” Chappelle replied.\nHow Dave Chappelle Supports and Invests in His Ohio Community\nBeyond nostalgia, Chappelle has taken an active role in local affairs. He has spoken at town hall meetings, addressed noise complaints tied to his outdoor comedy shows, and highlighted the economic impact of hosting events in a nearby cornfield, shows that reportedly generated $12 million for Ohio, including $4 million for Yellow Springs.\n“My town was dying ... I did shows in my neighbor’s cornfield, and these shows were very successful and may have even helped save the town,” he recalled during a 2020 “Saturday Night Live” monologue.\nWhether through comedy, community involvement, or commentary on national politics, Chappelle’s loyalty to Ohio remains constant.

She was 34.\nThe San Francisco Fire Department told People that teams responded to a medical emergency at the San Francisco Fairmont at around 3 a.m. and found an unnamed person dead at the scene. TMZ was the first to report Victoria's death.\nAdditionally, the San Francisco Police Department confirmed officers responded to the hotel on Thursday and met with paramedics before declaring an unnamed adult female dead.\nA cause of death remains unknown and officials have not released further details.\nHowever, audio obtained by TMZ reveals the call for the incident came in as a \"code 3 for the overdose, color change.\"\nCourt dockets reviewed by People also showed Victoria had been arrested at least two times in the past year. One of them was for drug possession.\nIn April, she was arrested in California's Napa County and charged with three misdemeanors: Obstructing a peace officer and two counts of being under the influence of a controlled substance without a valid prescription. She pleaded not guilty.\nAfter being arrested again in May, she was detained on June 17 in Napa County and charged with misdemeanor domestic battery. She pleaded not guilty on July 1.\nVictoria was the daughter of 79-year-old Tommy and his ex-wife, Kimberlea Cloughley.\nShe briefly followed in her father's footsteps by making appearances in 2002's \"Men in Black II,\" 2003's \"One Tree Hill\" and a film directed by her father in 2005 named \"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.\"", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "7cb9fb5c50fdcbe405d098f7b02ec1a7bb85692ec7e2c109c631a96411bbfce1", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_news_entertainment_daughter-of-actor-tommy-lee-jones-victoria-found-dead-at-san-francisco-fairmont-hotel-on-new-years-day-r.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

Our Storm Season section has everything you need to stay ahead of the storm and what to do in the aftermath.\nWHAT TO DO: BEFORE A HURRICANE\n- Plan ahead with an emergency kit. Build an emergency kit, including food, water, medical needs and important documents.\n- Make a family communications plan. Identify a friend or relative who lives out-of-state who household members will contact to notify they are safe. Make sure everyone has a cell phone, coins or a prepaid phone card.\n- Be aware of your surroundings. Learn the elevation level of your property and whether you are in a flood zone. If there are levees, dams or rivers in your area, be aware of them and whether they pose a hazard for you and your home.\n- Learn evacuation routes for your community. Determine where you would go and how to get there if you need to evacuate.\n- Make plans to secure your property. Use permanent storm shutters or board up your windows with marine plywood that has already been cut to fit and be installed. Tape does not prevent windows from breaking.\n- Keep the exterior of your home in good shape. Trim trees and shrubs so they are wind-resistant. Clear loose and clogged rain gutters and downspots. Plan to bring in all outdoor furniture, decorations and garbage cans.\nWHAT TO DO: DURING A HURRICANE\nIf a hurricane is likely to strike near your home, take the following steps:\n- Stay informed of the storm's track. Watch the Weather Experts or listen to our radio partners for the latest information.\n- Secure your home. Close storm shutters, secure outdoor objects and turn off propane tanks.\n- Ensure you have a supply of water in case the water is shut off. Fill the bath tub and other large containers with water.\nIf you are unable to evacuate during a storm:\n- Go to a wind-safe room. If you do not have one, then move away from windows and glass doors. Close all interior doors. Secure and brace external doors. Keep curtains and blinds closed. Avoid elevators.\n- Take refuge. You can do so in a small interior room, closet or hallway on the lowest level of your home. Lie on the floor under a table or another sturdy object.\nWHAT TO DO: AFTER A HURRICANE\n- Stay informed. Use a radio or weather radio to get information. Our weather partners will simulcast coverage when a storm threatens the area.\n- Use your mobile device. Watch us on your phone, tablet or kindle through the BHTV app.\n- Use flashlights and avoid candles. Any battery-powered light sources should be turned on outside before entering a building, as the battery could produce a spark that might ignite leaking gas.\n- Do not return home until authorities declare it is safe to do so. If you have evacuated, only return when notified that it is safe to do so. If you cannot return home and you need shelter, go to your nearest shelter.\n- Be careful when traveling on roads. Avoid floodwaters, especially when driving. Avoided flooded roads and washed out bridges. Watch out for fallen objects, downed electrical wires and weakened structures.\n- Report safety hazards to authorities if possible. Dangling or loose power lines should be reported to the power company.\n- Beware of spoiled and contaminated food and water. Do not drink or prepare food with tap water until you are sure it is not contaminated. Check refrigerated food for spoilage. If in doubt, throw it out.\n- NEVER use a generator inside a home or enclosed area. This includes garages, crawl spaces, sheds or similar areas, even if the area has a fan or open doors or windows. Deadly carbon monoxide can build up quickly and can linger for hours.\nWHAT TO DO: KEEPING PETS SAFE\n- Plan ahead. If you have to evacuate, you will need to find a shelter that can accomodate your pet, as many do not allow pets. In addition, many shelters that accept pets only take dogs and cats.\n- Have a \"grab and go\" bag for your pet. The bag should include an identification collar and rabies tag, a leash or harness, a muzzle (if needed), a supply of food and treats, water and food bowls, medication, medical records, a photo of your pet, newspaper and bags for clean-up. If you have a carrier, be ready to bring that as well.\n- Microchip your pets ahead of time. Should your pet become lost during the storm, microchips can help authorities easily reunite you with your pets. Make sure your contact information is up to date.\n- Contain your pets. Crate cats and small dogs and put large dogs on a leash. That way if you have to evacuate quickly, you will not waste time trying to find pets that may be scared or hiding. Note: NEVER leave your animals chained up outside.\n- Stay as calm as possible. Your pet may be able to detect your panic. If you stay calm, you'll be able to keep your pet calm as well.\n- Contact your local animal shelter ahead of time with any questions. Your county's animal control agency should be able to help you with any questions you might have.\nWHAT TO DO: FILING INSURANCE CLAIMS\nAlthough the first concern should be safety, it is important to be aware of the need to act promptly when filing claims for damages inflicted to your property by a hurricane.\n- Have your policy number available.\n- Contact your insurance company as soon as possible.\n- Make a list of damages. If possible, document damage with photos.\n- Fill out claim forms from insurance company and return them promptly.\n- Be sure you understand the claim process. If you are unfamiliar with it or do not understand, ask for a full explanation.\n- Contact your insurance company before an emergency to see if you are prepared if a disaster should occur.\nWHAT TO DO: EXTRA TIPS\n- Did you know that your National Flood Insurance Program Dwelling policy will pay up to $1,000 for costs you incur to protect your home from flood damage or imminent danger of flood? Read your policy.\n- Communication during evacuation: Charging your cell phone is high on most preparedness lists, but relying solely on your cell phone can prove unreliable simply because of the sheer volume of calls during such an emergency.\n- Privacy: We have all seen those gridlocked highways, moving very slowly. Make some provisions for facilities in your vehicle. A generous sheet of plastic sheeting secured to open car doors and roof clamps will afford some privacy. Include a bucket with plastic bags for a liner and twist ties.\n- Mosquito-proof tent: Several scenarios on this. If you evacuate and have a hotel reservation, traffic conditions may delay you and you may lose it. You can always use your tent as a bug-free haven while waiting for a hotel room or house repairs to be completed.\n- Sandbags: Millions of sandbags are filled and distributed each year with no information on how to use them correctly. They work wonderfully well when used with lightweight plastic sheeting for low-level flooding up to 4 feet.\n- Sewer back-up flooding: You can keep the floodwater out, but your tub and toilet will be like fountains of sewage. Install a manually closed knife-type gate valve in drainage system. A back-flow check valve may work but it is not relaible.\n- Don't walk through standing flood water: This is frequently mentioned because of sewer and chemical contamination, but more imminently deadly is the fact that fast rising flood waters will lift manhole covers off. That creates deep holes in the street that you can't see. Falling into one likely will result in drowning.\n- Expanding urethane foam? Sometimes it is recommended as a door sealant to keep floodwater out. If you do, this means opening doors with an axe.\n- Soffitt protection could be a very important step in keeping your roof attached in hurricane force winds. Soffitts are usually the first to go in high winds, causing insulation to shift and impede the egress of wind pressure. A simple improvement is to install PVC plastic or wood strips down the center of the soffitt and secure it to each rafter or truss with screws.\n- Roofs may be further strengthened by securing with straps or cables attached to anchors in the foundation. This can be done by the homeowner or a contractor at relatively low cost compared to retrofitting.\n- Turn around - don't drown. Everyone has heard and seen this repeatedly but people still do it. Don't drive a car through floodwaters. Floodwater and sand can ruin a car's transmission and differential. It can also destroy bearings, brakes, computers, wiring and starters.\nHURRICANE WEBSITES\n- National Hurricane Center - Maintains a continuous watch on tropical systems over the Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and eastern Pacific.\n- Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - Coordinates response to disasters occuring within the United States.\n- Florida Emergency Management - Prepares for disasters within Florida, and helps in the recovery process.\n- National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - Federal agency focused on the conditions of the oceans and atmosphere.

A fresco is a painting done on wet plaster so that the colors penetrate and become fixed. The piece, known as Creation (or sometimes Genesis), has been called Austin’s first mural.\nUniversity Baptist Church commissioned nationally acclaimed artist Seymour Fogel to create the piece. Fogel was a former apprentice to the famous Mexican painter Diego Rivera in the 1930s. According to reports, Fogel’s mural Creation initially shocked viewers. But over time, Austinites began to embrace this piece.\nEventually, more blank walls in Austin were covered in art that reflected the surrounding community. Some of the most well-known mural artists in Austin are Kerry Awn, Matthew Bonifacio Rodriguez, Chris Rogers, and Raul Valdez. While many remain, some important Austin murals are long gone. All public murals are under the constant threat from nature, vandalism, and property owners who want to paint over them.\nTo help people enjoy these pieces of wall art while they’re here, we’ve created a map of some of Austin’s key murals.\nCreation\n- 405 W 22nd St.\n- Known as the first mural in Austin, this fresco was painted around a doorway outside of University Baptist Church in 1950. A fresco is a painting done on wet plaster so that the colors penetrate and become fixed. The artist, Seymour Fogel, was an apprentice for Diego Rivera in the 1930s. Fogel was a professor at the University of Texas when he painted the mural.\nHi, How Are You?\n- 2100 Guadalupe St.\n- Texas outsider artist and musician Daniel Johnston painted this mural on the side of the Sound Exchange record store in 1993. When the record store closed in 2003, the restaurant Baja Fresh made plans to tear down the mural and replace it with windows. After public outcry, the restaurant agreed to keep the mural in place.\nPhoto of the \"Hi, How Are You?\" mural on 2100 Guadalupe St. (Spectrum News)\nAustintatious\n- 2300 Guadalupe St.\n- The Austintatious mural was first painted in 1974 by Kerry Awn, Tommy B., Rick Turner and their friends. It depicts Austin life in the early ‘70s. When the mural was vandalized in 2014, the original artists spent weeks repainting it.\nPhoto of the \"Austintatious\" mural on 2300 Guadalupe St. (Spectrum News)\n- 2426 Guadalupe St.\n- Artist Matthew Bonifacio Rodriguez is known for painting cats and expressive cartoon-like faces around Austin.\nVarsity Theater Mural\n- 24th and Guadalupe Street\n- This film-themed mural was painted by Carlos Lowry in 1979 on what was then the Varsity Theater. The space eventually became a Tower Records store and then a Wells Fargo bank. The mural depicts actors like Orson Welles in Citizen Kane and Jimmy Cliff in The Harder They Come.\nPhoto of the Varsity Theater mural on 24th and Guadalupe Street (Spectrum News)\nVarious Musicians\n- 24th and Guadalupe St.\n- This work by artist Federico Archuleta depicts musicians Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan and more. Archuleta’s stencil work can be seen in several locations around town.\nPhoto of the musicians mural on 24th and Guadalupe Street (Spectrum News)\nKobe and Gianna Bryant Mural\n- 2912 Guadalupe St.\n- This mural on the backside of Sushi Hi honors the late Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna. Texas artist Laced and Found created the piece with help from artists Snuk One and Ricki Loring.\nPhoto of the Kobe and Gianna Bryant mural on 2912 Guadalupe St. (Spectrum News)\nWe Rise\n- 1900 E 12th St.\n- Artist Chris Rogers was commissioned to paint this mural in 2017 after his previous mural at the same location had been painted over. “We Rise” was designed to reflect a vibrant and hopeful East Austin community.\nPhoto of the \"We Rise\" mural on 1900 E 12th St. (Spectrum News)\nRhapsody\n- 1021 E 11th St.\n- This mosaic in Dr. Charles E. Urdy Plaza in East Austin depicts local musicians. The mural was created by artist John Yancey with Luis Alicea and Steven B. Jones. Yancey is an art professor at the University of Texas and focuses on community-based art.\nPhoto of the \"Rhapsody\" mosaic mural on 1021 E 11th St. (Spectrum News)\nYou’re My Butter Half\n- 2000 E Martin Luther King Jr Blvd.\n- The United Way of Greater Austin commissioned the artist team at Antihero Ink (formerly Creative Suitcase) to paint this mural in 2012. The goal is to highlight United Way’s mission of bringing people together.\nPhoto of the \"You’re My Butter Half\" mural on 2000 E Martin Luther King Jr Blvd. (Spectrum News)\nHillside Miracle\n- 2100 E 3rd St.\n- This mural is the backdrop for the Hillside Theater at the Oswaldo A.B. Cantu/Pan American Recreation Center in East Austin. Raul Valdez painted it in 1978. The Chicano artist created the mural to illustrate community pride.

Our \njournalists vet and rigorously fact-check all information we report, in service of our mission to \nprovide a trustworthy source of unbiased news. Our journalists are thinkers, curators and \nmembers of their communities, and we will not use AI to replace those essential functions.     \n  \nWhile we recognize the opportunities artificial intelligence could present to advance our journalism \nand better serve our audience, we also understand the significant risks and challenges. These are \nthe principles that guide our work related to AI.   \n  \n1. Journalists at the Center \n• Any experimentation with AI tools is done carefully and thoughtfully, guided by \nleaders who prioritize journalistic ethics and human review.   \n• AI tools, like other tools long used in the service of reporting and delivering the \nnews, are managed by our journalists, which includes fact-checking and \nscrutinizing any material for accuracy and bias. Our journalists are ultimately \nresponsible for everything we report, and Spectrum News Journalism Standards \nGuidelines require several levels of human review before publication.  \n• We may use AI to check grammar or suggest ideas for headlines, summaries or \nsocial media promotional text, but any suggestions are considered and then edited \nby our reporters, editors and producers, who are responsible for what is published.   \n  \n2. Transparency with our Audience \n• We publish and update these principles, so our audience knows what guides our \nuse of AI and that nothing is published without human review.  \n• We clearly label any content produced by AI that is used as examples in stories \nabout AI. For video stories, that means both verbal and on-screen graphic \ndisclosures, and for our digital stories, any AI generated illustration will include both \na written disclosure and watermark on the image. We are particularly careful when \nreporting on so-called deepfakes, which are often designed to sow confusion. If we \ndecide there is significant news value in sharing clips, we ensure we are extremely \nclear that it was created with AI. \n• Spectrum News does not use AI to add or subtract any elements of photos, video or \naudio. We do not put any confidential information into AI tools. \n \n3. Empowering Excellent Journalism \n• The purpose of any tool is to enable us to improve our journalism and serve our \naudience more effectively. This includes tools that use AI. We are always seeking to \nimprove our processes so that our journalists can focus on uncovering, verifying \nand reporting the truth, producing compelling stories and serving the local audience \nwith accurate and unbiased information.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "eef78d560e108e01f1c7a754c5256c7fc8dc5c3631bebdca508da109d599d5ba", "out_path": "raw/pdf/https_spectrumlocalnews.com_content_dam_News_static_Texas_TX-pdf_Spectrum_News_AI_Principles_March_2025.pdf_logActivity_true.pdf", "notes": null, "tags": ["pdf"]}

While supporters tout billions in investment and hundreds of new jobs, residents nearby are voicing serious concerns about water usage, electricity and the effects on their neighborhoods.\nThe data center is currently under construction in the northeast part of the city of El Paso. Meta says it selected El Paso for its workforce, available open land and access to renewable energy. As the project advances, many in this community are now asking questions about how they’ll be affected by one of the region’s largest tech investments.\nIn the desert area on the outskirts of the city, the massive 1.2 million-square-foot facility is now under construction. It’s the tech giant’s future data center, a project Jon Barela of the Borderplex Alliance —an organization focused on economic development in El Paso, Las Cruces, New Mexico and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico—says has been in the works for four years.\n“It is one of the best world companies, so to have them here it’s an absolute honor here in El Paso County, and we are thrilled to have them and welcome them here.” Barela said.\nHe describes Meta’s arrival as a turning point for the region and the result of years of work to position El Paso as a hub for advanced data and AI infrastructure.\n“I have been working with other valued community partners, elected officials, the city and county levels, and of course, our utilities El Paso Water, and El Paso Electric, which are very much part of this team to locate this project, which would be at least $1.5 billion initial investment with hopefully many more billions to come,” he said.\nBarela says he has witnessed the impact firsthand. In 2016, he helped recruit Meta to build its first New Mexico data center in Los Lunas.\n“Their construction is complete, and thousands of jobs have been created in that area. The population has grown at a good rate there in central New Mexico, and there have been many positive things that have happened,” he said.\nBut it’s Barela’s work with El Paso Water and El Paso Electric that many in this community are most interested in. The new facility will require large amounts of electricity to cool its servers.\nEl Paso is not on the Texas grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). But while Meta says the site will operate on 100% renewable energy, neighbors worry it could still strain the local power grid.\nWater usage has sparked even greater controversy. Meta’s design relies on evaporative cooling. Initial estimates suggest the facility could consume up to 1.5 billion gallons of water each year, an amount that residents fear may affect water availability and raise rates.\n“It’s good that they are bringing another company, and it’s good that they are bringing job opportunities, but to take 1.5 billion gallons of water for the community, I think they need to research that more and possibly find a better way to do it instead of taking out the water from homeowners,” said Richard Herrera, a neighbor to the data center.\nEl Paso Water insists the region can manage the increased demand, stating the final system design will require much less water than initially estimated and that Meta will cover the full cost of any necessary infrastructure upgrades. However, for families already coping with rising utility bills, the ongoing uncertainty is troubling.\n“It’s very bad, and also when there is too much water using the bills are going up again, every year they go up, and that’s not good for the people who work for our families, and having bills too high is not good,” said Martin Ramos, another neighbor of the data center.\nMeta says the project will create 1,200 construction jobs at its peak and approximately 100 long-term positions, while generating millions in local tax revenue. Construction is expected to continue through 2028.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "92db786011ec140512b3efa8ff1975eceaac77192a3befa221d643e72890de18", "out_path": "raw/html/https_spectrumlocalnews.com_tx_austin_news_2025_11_24_meta-data-center-in-east-el-paso-concerns-local-residents.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

(KFOX14/CBS4) —A community organization and two residents have filed a lawsuit against the Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners, alleging the county violated state and local law when it approved ordinances tied to the proposed $165 billion Project Jupiter data center in Santa Teresa.\nThe complaint, filed Oct. 17 in the Third Judicial District Court by the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, represents Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County and residents José Saldaña Jr. of Sunland Park and Vivian Fuller of Santa Teresa.\nThe lawsuit challenges three ordinances adopted by the county commission.\nThe first authorizes the issuance of $165 billion in Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRBs) for the project.\nThe second and third ordinances authorize Local Economic Development Act (LEDA) funding to support Project Jupiter, including anticipated permit fees.\nCommissioners approved the measures in two separate 4-1 votes in September and October, with Commissioner Susana Chaparro voting against both times.\nRELATED: Doña Ana County approves $165 billion AI data center despite protests and calls for delay\nPlaintiffs claim the county relied on a single, incomplete application from Project Jupiter’s developers that contained blank and missing pages and lacked critical information necessary to make a fully informed decision.\nThe filing also states that county officials held private meetings with the project’s developers months before the public hearings and signed a non-disclosure agreement earlier this year.\nPlaintiffs argue that these actions limited transparency and prevented residents from fully understanding the project before the votes.\nThe lawsuit seeks judicial review of the ordinances, a court order invalidating the county’s approval, and a stay halting implementation while the case proceeds.\nProject Jupiter, led by Borderplex Digital Assets, would include a hyperscale data center, microgrid, battery storage, and a desalination plant.\nCounty officials have previously described the project as one of the largest potential commercial developments in New Mexico history, with the potential to bring thousands of jobs.\nCommunity members and environmental advocates have raised concerns about the project’s potential strain on water and energy resources and its impacts on surrounding neighborhoods, as well as the longevity of the jobs the center would bring.\nThe full press release can be found on the New Mexico Environmental Law Center website.\nWe have reached out to each of the County Commissioners for comment and have not heard back.\nWe will keep you updated both on air and online when new details arise.\nRELATED: Project Jupiter ignites debate: Economic tech boom or ecological bane for Borderland?\nSign up to receive the top interesting stories from in and around our community once daily in your inbox.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "86e8950420d32b3e6efd567e3e88532c525912f0f4aec630f218c041fa401c68", "out_path": "raw/html/https_kfoxtv.com_newsletter-daily_community-group-sues-dona-ana-county-commissioners-over-project-jupiter-approval.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}

While supporters tout billions in investment and hundreds of new jobs, residents nearby are voicing serious concerns about water usage, electricity and the effects on their neighborhoods.\nThe data center is currently under construction in the northeast part of the city of El Paso. Meta says it selected El Paso for its workforce, available open land and access to renewable energy. As the project advances, many in this community are now asking questions about how they’ll be affected by one of the region’s largest tech investments.\nIn the desert area on the outskirts of the city, the massive 1.2 million-square-foot facility is now under construction. It’s the tech giant’s future data center, a project Jon Barela of the Borderplex Alliance —an organization focused on economic development in El Paso, Las Cruces, New Mexico and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico—says has been in the works for four years.\n“It is one of the best world companies, so to have them here it’s an absolute honor here in El Paso County, and we are thrilled to have them and welcome them here.” Barela said.\nHe describes Meta’s arrival as a turning point for the region and the result of years of work to position El Paso as a hub for advanced data and AI infrastructure.\n“I have been working with other valued community partners, elected officials, the city and county levels, and of course, our utilities El Paso Water, and El Paso Electric, which are very much part of this team to locate this project, which would be at least $1.5 billion initial investment with hopefully many more billions to come,” he said.\nBarela says he has witnessed the impact firsthand. In 2016, he helped recruit Meta to build its first New Mexico data center in Los Lunas.\n“Their construction is complete, and thousands of jobs have been created in that area. The population has grown at a good rate there in central New Mexico, and there have been many positive things that have happened,” he said.\nBut it’s Barela’s work with El Paso Water and El Paso Electric that many in this community are most interested in. The new facility will require large amounts of electricity to cool its servers.\nEl Paso is not on the Texas grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). But while Meta says the site will operate on 100% renewable energy, neighbors worry it could still strain the local power grid.\nWater usage has sparked even greater controversy. Meta’s design relies on evaporative cooling. Initial estimates suggest the facility could consume up to 1.5 billion gallons of water each year, an amount that residents fear may affect water availability and raise rates.\n“It’s good that they are bringing another company, and it’s good that they are bringing job opportunities, but to take 1.5 billion gallons of water for the community, I think they need to research that more and possibly find a better way to do it instead of taking out the water from homeowners,” said Richard Herrera, a neighbor to the data center.\nEl Paso Water insists the region can manage the increased demand, stating the final system design will require much less water than initially estimated and that Meta will cover the full cost of any necessary infrastructure upgrades. However, for families already coping with rising utility bills, the ongoing uncertainty is troubling.\n“It’s very bad, and also when there is too much water using the bills are going up again, every year they go up, and that’s not good for the people who work for our families, and having bills too high is not good,” said Martin Ramos, another neighbor of the data center.\nMeta says the project will create 1,200 construction jobs at its peak and approximately 100 long-term positions, while generating millions in local tax revenue. Construction is expected to continue through 2028.", "lang": null, "sha256_text": "92db786011ec140512b3efa8ff1975eceaac77192a3befa221d643e72890de18", "out_path": "raw/html/https_spectrumlocalnews.com_tx_austin_news_2025_11_24_meta-data-center-in-east-el-paso-concerns-local-residents.html", "notes": null, "tags": ["html"]}
